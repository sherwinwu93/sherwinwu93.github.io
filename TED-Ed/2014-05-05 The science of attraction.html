<h2 id="orga0addbd">2014-05-05 The science of attraction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga0addbd">
<p class="verse">
We like to think of romantic feelings as spontaneous and indescribable things<br />
&#xa0;that come from the heart.<br />
But it's actually your brain running a complex series of calculations within a matter of seconds<br />
&#xa0;that's responsible for determining attraction.<br />
Doesn't sound quite as poetic, does it?<br />
But just because the calculations are happening in your brain<br />
&#xa0;doesn't mean those warm, fuzzy feelings are all in your head.<br />
<br />
In fact, all five of your senses play a role, each able to vote for, or veto, a budding attraction.<br />
The eyes are the first components in attraction.<br />
Many visual beauty standards vary between cultures and eras,<br />
&#xa0;and signs of youth, fertility and good health,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;such as long lustrous hair, or smooth, scar-free skin,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;are almost always in demand<br />
&#xa0;because they're associated with reproductive fitness.<br />
And when the eyes spot something they like,<br />
&#xa0;our instinct is to move closer so the other senses can investigate.<br />
<br />
The nose's contribution to romance is more than noticing perfume or cologne.<br />
It's able to pick up on natural chemical signals known as pheromones.<br />
These not only convey important physical or genetic information about their source<br />
&#xa0;but are able to activate a physiological or behavioral response in the recipient.<br />
In one study, a group of women at different points in their ovulation cycles<br />
&#xa0;wore the same T-shirts for three nights.<br />
After male volunteers were randomly assigned to smell either one of the worn shirts,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;or a new unworn one,<br />
&#xa0;saliva samples showed an increase in testosterone in those<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;who had smelled a shirt worn by an ovulating woman.<br />
Such a testosterone boost may give a man the nudge to pursue a woman<br />
&#xa0;he might not have otherwise noticed.<br />
A woman's nose is particularly attuned to MHC molecules, which are used to fight disease.<br />
In this case, opposites attract.<br />
When a study asked women to smell T-shirts that had been worn by different men,<br />
&#xa0;they preferred the odors of those whose MHC molecules differed from theirs.<br />
This makes sense.<br />
Genes that result in a greater variety of immunities may give offspring a major survival advantage.<br />
<br />
Our ears also determine attraction.<br />
Men prefer females with high-pitched, breathy voices, and wide formant spacing,<br />
&#xa0;correlated with smaller body size.<br />
While women prefer low-pitched voices with a narrow formant spacing<br />
&#xa0;that suggest a larger body size.<br />
<br />
And not surprisingly, touch turns out to be crucial for romance.<br />
In this experiment, not realizing the study had begun,<br />
&#xa0;participants were asked to briefly hold the coffee, either hot or iced.<br />
Later, the participants read a story about a hypothetical person,<br />
&#xa0;and were asked to rate their personality.<br />
Those who had held the hot cup of coffee<br />
&#xa0;perceived the person in the story as happier, more social, more generous and better-natured<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;than those who had held the cup of iced coffee,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;who rated the person as cold, stoic, and unaffectionate.<br />
<br />
If a potential mate has managed to pass all these tests, there's still one more:<br />
&#xa0;the infamous first kiss, a rich and complex exchange of tactile and chemical cues,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;such as the smell of one's breath, and the taste of their mouth.<br />
This magical moment is so critical<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that a majority of men and women have reported losing their attraction to someone<br />
&#xa0;after a bad first kiss.<br />
Once attraction is confirmed,<br />
&#xa0;your bloodstream is flooded with norepinephrine,<br />
&#xa0;activating your fight or flight system.<br />
Your heart beats faster, your pupils dilate, and your body releases glucose for additional energy,<br />
&#xa0;not because you're in danger<br />
&#xa0;but because your body is telling you that something important is happening.<br />
To help you focus, norepinephrine creates a sort of tunnel vision,<br />
&#xa0;blocking out surrounding distractions,<br />
&#xa0;possibly even warping your sense of time, and enhancing your memory.<br />
This might explain why people never forget their first kiss.<br />
<br />
The idea of so much of our attraction being influenced by chemicals and evolutionary biology<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;may seem cold and scientific rather than romantic,<br />
&#xa0;but the next time you see someone you like,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;try to appreciate how your entire body is playing matchmaker to decide<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;if that beautiful stranger is right for you.<br />
