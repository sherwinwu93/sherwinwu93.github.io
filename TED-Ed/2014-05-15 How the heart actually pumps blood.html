<h2 id="org72be97c">2014-05-15 How the heart actually pumps blood</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org72be97c">
<p class="verse">
For most of history, humans had no idea what purpose the heart served.<br />
In fact, the organ so confused Leonardo da Vinci, that he gave up studying it.<br />
Although everyone could feel their own heart beating,<br />
&#xa0;it wasn't always clear what each thump was achieving.<br />
<br />
Now we know that the heart pumps blood.<br />
But that fact wasn't always obvious,<br />
&#xa0;because if a heart was exposed or taken out, the body would perish quickly.<br />
It's also impossible to see through the blood vessels,<br />
&#xa0;and even if that were possible,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;the blood itself is opaque, making it difficult to see the heart valves working.<br />
Even in the 21st century, only a few people in surgery teams have actually seen a working heart.<br />
Internet searches for heart function, point to crude models, diagrams or animations<br />
&#xa0;that don't really show how it works.<br />
It's as if there has been a centuries old conspiracy amongst teachers and students<br />
&#xa0;to accept that heart function cannot be demonstrated.<br />
Meaning that the next best thing is simply to cut it open and label the parts.<br />
That way students might not fully grasp the way it works, but can superficially understand it,<br />
&#xa0;learning such concepts as the heart is a four-chambered organ,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;or potentially misleading statements like, mammals have a dual-circulation:<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;one with blood going to the lungs and back, and another to the body and back.<br />
<br />
In reality, mammals have a figure-eight circulation.<br />
Blood goes from one heart pump to the lungs,<br />
&#xa0;back to the second heart pump, which sends it to the body, and then back to the first pump.<br />
That's an important difference because it marks two completely different morphologies.<br />
This confusion makes many students wary of the heart in biology lessons,<br />
&#xa0;thinking it signals an intimidating subject full of complicated names and diagrams.<br />
Only those who end up studying medicine completely understand how it all actually works.<br />
That's when its functions become apparent<br />
&#xa0;as medics get to observe the motion of the heart's valves.<br />
<br />
So, let's imagine you're a medic for a day.<br />
What you'll need to get started is a whole fresh heart, like one from a sheep or pig.<br />
Immerse this heart in water and you'll see that it doesn't pump when squeezed by hand.<br />
That's because water doesn't enter the heart clearly enough for the pumping mechanism to work.<br />
We can solve this problem in an extraordinarily simple way.<br />
Simply identify the two atria and cut them off, trimming them down to the tops of the ventricles.<br />
This makes the heart look less complicated because the atria have several incoming veins attached.<br />
So without them there,<br />
&#xa0;the only vessels remaining are the two major heart arteries:<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;the aorta and pulmonary artery, which rise like white columns from between the ventricles.<br />
It looks &#x2013; and really is &#x2013; very simple.<br />
If you run water into the right ventricle from a tap (the left also works, but less spectacularly),<br />
&#xa0;you'll see that the ventricular valve tries to close against the incoming stream.<br />
And then ventricle inflates with water.<br />
Squeeze the ventricle and a stream of water squirts out of the pulmonary artery.<br />
The ventricular valves,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;called the tricuspid in the right ventricle and the mitral in the left,<br />
&#xa0;can be seen through the clear water opening and closing like parachutes<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;as the ventricle is rhythmically squeezed.<br />
This flow of water mimics the flow of blood in life.<br />
The valves are completely efficient.<br />
You'll notice they don't leak at all when the ventricles are squeezed.<br />
Over time, they also close against each other with very little wear and tear,<br />
&#xa0;which explains how this mechanism continues to work seamlessly for more than 2 billion beats<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;a heart gives in its lifetime.<br />
<br />
Now, anyone studying the heart can hold one in their hands,<br />
&#xa0;make it pump for real and watch the action unfold.<br />
So place your hand above your own and feel its rhymic beat.<br />
Understanding how this dependable inner pump works gives new resonance to the feeling you get<br />
&#xa0;when you run a race, drink too much caffeine or catch the eye of the one you love.<br />
