<h2 id="orgb5ea871">2015-06-02 How people rationalize fraud</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb5ea871">
<p class="verse">
If you ask people whether they think stealing is wrong, most of them would answer, "Yes."<br />
And yet, in 2013,<br />
&#xa0;organizations all over the world lost an estimated total of 3.7 trillion dollars to fraud,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;which includes crimes like embezzlement, pyramid schemes, and false insurance claims.<br />
This wasn't just the work of a few bad apples.<br />
The truth is that many people are susceptible<br />
&#xa0;not only to the temptation to commit fraud<br />
&#xa0;but to convincing themselves that they've done nothing wrong.<br />
<br />
So why does fraud happen?<br />
While individual motivations may differ from case to case,<br />
&#xa0;the fraud triangle, a model developed by criminologist Donald Cressey,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;shows three conditions that make fraud likely: pressure, opportunity, and rationalization.<br />
Pressure is often what motivates someone to engage in fraud to begin with.<br />
It could be a personal debt, an addiction, an earnings quota, a sudden job loss,<br />
&#xa0;or an illness in the family.<br />
As for opportunity, many people in both public and private sectors have access to tools<br />
&#xa0;that enable them to commit and conceal fraud:<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;corporate credit cards, internal company data, or control over the budget.<br />
The combination of pressure and being exposed to such opportunities on a daily basis<br />
&#xa0;can create a strong temptation.<br />
<br />
But even with these two elements, most fraud still requires rationalization.<br />
Many fraudsters are first time offenders,<br />
&#xa0;so in order to commit an act most would regard as wrong, they need to justify it to themselves.<br />
Some feel entitled to the money<br />
&#xa0;because they are underpaid and overworked and others believe their fraud is victimless,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;perhaps even planning to return the money once their crisis is resolved.<br />
Some of the most common types of fraud don't even register as such to the perpetrator.<br />
Examples include employees fudging time sheets or expense reports,<br />
&#xa0;taxpayers failing to report cash earnings,<br />
&#xa0;or service providers overbilling insurance companies.<br />
Though these may seem small, and can sometimes only involve hundreds of dollars,<br />
&#xa0;they all contribute to the big picture.<br />
And then there's fraud on a massive scale.<br />
<br />
In 2003, Italian dairy food giant Parmalat went bankrupt<br />
&#xa0;after it was found to have fabricated a 4 billion dollar bank account<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;and falsified financial statements<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;to hide the fact that its subsidiaries had been losing money.<br />
Because it was family controlled, corporate governance and regulator supervision were difficult,<br />
&#xa0;and the company likely hoped that the losses could be recouped before anyone found out.<br />
<br />
And it's not just corporate greed.<br />
Governments and non-profits are also susceptible to fraud.<br />
During her time as City Comptroller for Dixon, Illinois,<br />
&#xa0;Rita Crundwell embezzled over 53 million dollars.<br />
Rita was one of the country's leading quarter horse breeders and winner of 52 world championships.<br />
But the cost of maintaining the herd ran to 200,000 dollars per month.<br />
Because her position gave her complete control over city finances,<br />
&#xa0;she was easily able to divert money to an account she used for private expenses,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and the scheme went unnoticed for 20 years.<br />
It is believed that Crundwell felt entitled to a lavish lifestyle based on her position,<br />
&#xa0;and the notoriety her winnings brought to the city.<br />
<br />
It's tempting to think of fraud as a victimless crime<br />
&#xa0;because corporations and civic institutions aren't people.<br />
But fraud harms real people in virtually every case:<br />
&#xa0;the employees of Parmalat who lost their jobs,<br />
&#xa0;the citizens of Dixon whose taxes subsidized horse breeding,<br />
&#xa0;the customers of companies which raise their prices to offset losses.<br />
Sometimes the effects are obvious and devastating,<br />
&#xa0;like when Bernie Madoff caused thousands of people to lose their life savings.<br />
But often they're subtle and not easy to untangle.<br />
Yet someone, somewhere is left holding the bill.<br />
