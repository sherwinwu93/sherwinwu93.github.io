<h2 id="org2a83349">The uncertain location of electrons</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2a83349">
<p class="verse">
You probably know that all stuff is made up of atoms<br />
&#xa0;and that an atom is a really, really, really, really tiny particle.<br />
Every atom has a core,<br />
&#xa0;which is made up of at least one positively charged particle called a proton,<br />
&#xa0;and in most cases, some number of neutral particles called neutrons.<br />
That core is surrounded by negatively charged particles called electrons.<br />
The identity of an atom is determined only by the number of protons in its nucleus.<br />
Hydrogen is hydrogen because it has just one proton,<br />
&#xa0;carbon is carbon because it has six,<br />
&#xa0;gold is gold because it has 79, and so on.<br />
<br />
Indulge me in a momentary tangent.<br />
How do we know about atomic structure?<br />
We can't see protons, neutrons, or electrons.<br />
So, we do a bunch of experiments and develop a model for what we think is there.<br />
Then we do some more experiments and see if they agree with the model.<br />
If they do, great.<br />
If they don't, it might be time for a new model.<br />
We've had lots of very different models for atoms since Democritus in 400 BC,<br />
&#xa0;and there will almost certainly be many more to come.<br />
Okay, tangent over.<br />
<br />
The cores of atoms tend to stick together,<br />
&#xa0;but electrons are free to move,<br />
&#xa0;and this is why chemists love electrons.<br />
If we could marry them, we probably would.<br />
But electrons are weird.<br />
They appear to behave either as particles, like little baseballs, or as waves, like water waves,<br />
&#xa0;depending on the experiment that we perform.<br />
One of the weirdest things about electrons is that we can't exactly say where they are.<br />
It's not that we don't have the equipment,<br />
&#xa0;it's that this uncertainty is part of our model of the electron.<br />
So, we can't pinpoint them, fine.<br />
But we can say<br />
&#xa0;there's a certain probability of finding an electron in a given space around the nucleus.<br />
And that means that we can ask the following question:<br />
&#xa0;If we drew a shape around the nucleus<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;such that we would be 95% sure of finding a given electron within that shape,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;what would it look like?<br />
<br />
Here are a few of these shapes.<br />
Chemists call them orbitals, and what each one looks like depends on, among other things,<br />
&#xa0;how much energy it has.<br />
The more energy an orbital has, the farther most of its density is from the nucleus.<br />
By they way, why did we pick 95% and not 100%?<br />
Well, that's another quirk of our model of the electron.<br />
Past a certain distance from the nucleus,<br />
&#xa0;the probability of finding an electron starts to decrease more or less exponentially,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;which means that while it will approach zero, it'll never actually hit zero.<br />
So, in every atom, there is some small, but non-zero, probability that<br />
&#xa0;for a very, very short period of time,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;one of its electrons is at the other end of the known universe.<br />
But mostly electrons stay close to their nucleus as clouds of negative charged density<br />
&#xa0;that shift and move with time.<br />
<br />
How electrons from one atom interact with electrons from another determines almost everything.<br />
Atoms can give up their electrons, surrendering them to other atoms, or they can share electrons.<br />
And the dynamics of this social network are what make chemistry interesting.<br />
From plain old rocks to the beautiful complexity of life,<br />
&#xa0;the nature of everything we see, hear, smell, taste, touch, and even feel is<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;determined at the atomic level.<br />
