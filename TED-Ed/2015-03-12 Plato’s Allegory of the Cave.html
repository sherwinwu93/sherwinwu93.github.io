<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdb302e8">
<p class="verse">
What is reality, knowledge, the meaning of life?<br />
Big topics you might tackle figuratively<br />
&#xa0;explaining existence as a journey down a road or across an ocean,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;a climb, a war, a book, a thread, a game, a window of opportunity,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;or an all-too-short-lived flicker of flame.<br />
<br />
2,400 years ago, one of history's famous thinkers said life is like being chained up in a cave,<br />
&#xa0;forced to watch shadows flitting across a stone wall.<br />
Pretty cheery, right?<br />
That's actually what Plato suggested in his Allegory of the Cave,<br />
&#xa0;found in Book VII of 'The Republic,'<br />
&#xa0;in which the Greek philosopher envisioned the ideal society<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;by examining concepts like justice, truth and beauty.<br />
<br />
In the allegory, a group of prisoners have been confined in a cavern since birth,<br />
&#xa0;with no knowledge of the outside world.<br />
They are chained, facing a wall, unable to turn their heads,<br />
&#xa0;while a fire behind them gives off a faint light.<br />
Occasionally, people pass by the fire,<br />
&#xa0;carrying figures of animals and other objects that cast shadows on the wall.<br />
The prisoners name and classify these illusions, believing they're perceiving actual entities.<br />
Suddenly, one prisoner is freed and brought outside for the first time.<br />
The sunlight hurts his eyes and he finds the new environment disorienting.<br />
When told that the things around him are real, while the shadows were mere reflections,<br />
&#xa0;he cannot believe it.<br />
The shadows appeared much clearer to him.<br />
But gradually, his eyes adjust until he can look at reflections in the water,<br />
&#xa0;at objects directly, and finally at the Sun,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;whose light is the ultimate source of everything he has seen.<br />
The prisoner returns to the cave to share his discovery,<br />
&#xa0;but he is no longer used to the darkness, and has a hard time seeing the shadows on the wall.<br />
The other prisoners think the journey has made him stupid and blind,<br />
&#xa0;and violently resist any attempts to free them.<br />
<br />
Plato introduces this passage as an analogy of what it's like to be a philosopher<br />
&#xa0;trying to educate the public.<br />
Most people are not just comfortable in their ignorance but hostile to anyone who points it out.<br />
In fact, the real life Socrates was sentenced to death by the Athenian government<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;for disrupting the social order,<br />
&#xa0;and his student Plato spends much of 'The Republic' disparaging Athenian democracy,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;while promoting rule by philosopher kings.<br />
<br />
With the cave parable,<br />
&#xa0;Plato may be arguing that the masses are too stubborn and ignorant to govern themselves.<br />
But the allegory has captured imaginations for 2,400 years because it can be read in far more ways.<br />
Importantly, the allegory is connected to the theory of forms,<br />
&#xa0;developed in Plato's other dialogues,<br />
&#xa0;which holds that like the shadows on the wall,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;things in the physical world are flawed reflections of ideal forms,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;such as roundness, or beauty.<br />
In this way, the cave leads to many fundamental questions,<br />
&#xa0;including the origin of knowledge, the problem of representation,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and the nature of reality itself.<br />
For theologians, the ideal forms exist in the mind of a creator.<br />
For philosophers of language viewing the forms as linguistic concepts,<br />
&#xa0;the theory illustrates the problem of grouping concrete things under abstract terms.<br />
And others still wonder<br />
&#xa0;whether we can really know that the things outside the cave are any more real than the shadows.<br />
<br />
As we go about our lives, can we be confident in what we think we know?<br />
Perhaps one day, a glimmer of light may punch a hole in your most basic assumptions.<br />
Will you break free to struggle towards the light,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;even if it costs you, your friends and family,<br />
&#xa0;or stick with comfortable and familiar illusions?<br />
Truth or habit?<br />
Light or shadow?<br />
Hard choices, but if it's any consolation, you're not alone.<br />
There are lots of us down here.<br />
