<p class="verse">
Good evening! What's the matter?<br />
Are you afraid of vampires?<br />
He he, no need to worry, I'm not staying for dinner.<br />
I'm here to guide you through a brief history of vampires,<br />
&#xa0;illustrating how our image has changed<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;from a shambling corpse to the dapper gentleman you see before you.<br />
Vampires are nearly as old as you humans.<br />
Stories about us, revenants, appear in cultures extending as far back as prehistoric times.<br />
But we weren't called vampires back then<br />
&#xa0;and most of us did not look the way we imagine vampires today.<br />
<br />
Ha, far from it!<br />
For example, the Mesopotamian Lamashtu was a creature with the head of a lion<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and the body of the donkey,<br />
&#xa0;and the ancient Greek Striges were simply described as bloodthirsty birds.<br />
Others were even stranger.<br />
The Philippine Manananggal would sever her upper torso and sprout huge, bat-like wings to fly.<br />
The Malaysian Penanggalan was a flying female head with dangling entrails.<br />
And the Australian Yara-ma-yha-who was a little red guy<br />
&#xa0;with a big head, a large mouth, and bloodsuckers on his hands and feet.<br />
Oh, and let's not forget the Caribbean's Soucouyant,<br />
&#xa0;the West African obayifo, and the Mexican Tlahuelpuchi.<br />
Charming, aren't they?<br />
Though they may look vastly different, all of these beings have one common characteristic:<br />
&#xa0;They sustain themselves by consuming the life force of a living creature.<br />
This shared trait is what defines a vampire &#x2013; all the other attributes change with the times.<br />
So, how do we arrive at the reanimated fellow you see before you?<br />
<br />
Our modern ideal emerges in 18th-century Eastern Europe.<br />
With the dramatic increase of vampire superstitions, stories of bloodsucking,<br />
&#xa0;shadowy creatures become nightly bedside terrors.<br />
And popular folklore,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;like the Moroi among the Romani people and the Lugat in Albania,<br />
&#xa0;provide the most common vampire traits known today,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;such as vampires being undead and nocturnal and shape-shifting.<br />
You see, Eastern Europe in the 18th century was a pretty grim place<br />
&#xa0;with many deaths occurring from unknown diseases and plagues.<br />
Without medical explanations,<br />
&#xa0;people searched for supernatural causes<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and found what looked like evidence in the corpses of the victims.<br />
When villagers dug up bodies to discern the cause of the mysterious deaths,<br />
&#xa0;they would often find the cadavers looking very much alive<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#x2013; longer hair and fingernails, bloated bellies, and blood at the corners of mouths.<br />
Clearly, these people were not really dead.<br />
Heh, they were vampires!<br />
And they had been leaving their graves to feast on the living.<br />
The terrified villagers would quickly enact a ritual to kill the undead.<br />
The practices varied across the region,<br />
&#xa0;but usually included beheadings, burnings,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and staking the body to the coffin to prevent it from getting up.<br />
Grizzly stuff!<br />
But what the villagers interpreted as unholy reanimation were actually normal symptoms of death.<br />
When a body decomposes, the skin dehydrates, causing the hair and fingernails to extend.<br />
Bacteria in the stomach creates gases that fill the belly,<br />
&#xa0;which force out blood and matter through the mouth.<br />
Unfortunately, this science was not yet known, so the villagers kept digging.<br />
In fact, so many bodies were dug up<br />
&#xa0;that the Empress of Austria sent her physician around to disprove the vampire stories,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and she even established a law prohibiting grave tampering.<br />
<br />
Still, even after the vampire hunts had died down,<br />
&#xa0;the stories of legends survived in local superstition.<br />
This led to works of literature,<br />
&#xa0;such as Polidori's 'The Vampyre,' the Gothic novel 'Carmilla,'<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and, most famously, Bram Stoker's 'Dracula.'<br />
Although Stoker incorporated historical material,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;like Elizabeth Báthory's virgin blood baths and the brutal executions of Vlad Dracul,<br />
&#xa0;it was these local myths that inspired the main elements of his story:<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;the Transylvanian setting, using garlic to defend oneself, and the staking of the heart.<br />
While these attributes are certainly familiar to us,<br />
&#xa0;elements he invented himself have also lasted over the years:<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;fear of crucifixes, weakness in sunlight, and the vampire's inability to see their reflection.<br />
By inventing new traits, Stoker perfectly enacted the age-old tradition of<br />
&#xa0;elaborating upon and expanding the myth of vampires.<br />
As we saw, maybe you met my relatives,<br />
&#xa0;a huge of variety of creatures stalked the night before Dracula,<br />
&#xa0;and many more will continue to creep through our nightmares.<br />
Yet, so long as they subsist off a living being's life force, they are part of my tribe.<br />
Even sparkling vampires can be included.<br />
After all, it's the continued storytelling and reimagining of the vampire legend<br />
&#xa0;that allows us to truly live forever.<br />
