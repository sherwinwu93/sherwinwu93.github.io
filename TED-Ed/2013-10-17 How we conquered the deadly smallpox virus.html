<h2 id="orgeeb21c5">2013-10-17 How we conquered the deadly smallpox virus</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgeeb21c5">
<p class="verse">
10,000 years ago, a deadly virus arose in northeastern Africa.<br />
The virus spread through the air,<br />
&#xa0;attacking the skin cells, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes of its victims.<br />
The unlucky infected developed fevers, vomiting, and rashes.<br />
30% of infected people died during the second week of infection.<br />
Survivors bore scars and scabs for the rest of their lives.<br />
Smallpox had arrived.<br />
<br />
In 1350 B.C., the first smallpox epidemics hit during the Egypt-Hittite war.<br />
Egyptian prisoners spread smallpox to the Hittites,<br />
&#xa0;which killed their king and devastated his civilization.<br />
Insidiously, smallpox made its way around the world via Egyptian merchants,<br />
&#xa0;then through the Arab world with the Crusades,<br />
&#xa0;and all the way to the Americas with the Spanish and Portuguese conquests.<br />
Since then, it has killed billions of people<br />
&#xa0;with an estimated 300 to 500 million people killed in the 20th century alone.<br />
<br />
But smallpox is not unbeatable.<br />
In fact, the fall of smallpox started long before modern medicine.<br />
It began all the way back in 1022 A.D.<br />
According to a small book, called "The Correct Treatment of Small Pox,"<br />
&#xa0;a Buddhist nun living in a famous mountain<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;named O Mei Shan in the southern providence of Sichuan<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;would grind up smallpox scabs and blow the powder into nostrils of healthy people.<br />
She did this after noticing that those who managed to survive smallpox never got it again,<br />
&#xa0;and her odd treatment worked.<br />
The procedure, called variolation, slowly evolved and by the 1700's,<br />
&#xa0;doctors were taking material from sores<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and putting them into healthy people through four or five scratches on the arm.<br />
This worked pretty well as inoculated people would not get reinfected, but it wasn't foolproof.<br />
Up to three percent of people would still die after being exposed to the pass.<br />
<br />
It wasn't until English physician Edward Jenner noticed something interesting about dairy maids<br />
&#xa0;that we got our modern solution.<br />
At age 13, while Jenner was apprentice to a country surgeon and apothecary in Sodbury, near Bristol,<br />
&#xa0;he heard a dairy maid say,<br />
&#xa0;"I shall never have smallpox, for I have had cowpox.<br />
&#xa0;I shall never have an ugly, pockmarked face."<br />
Cowpox is a skin disease that resembles smallpox and infects cows.<br />
Later on, as a physician, he realized that she was right,<br />
&#xa0;women who got cowpox didn't develop the deadly smallpox.<br />
Smallpox and cowpox viruses are from the same family.<br />
But when a virus infects an unfamiliar host,<br />
&#xa0;in this case cowpox infecting a human, it is less virulent,<br />
&#xa0;so Jenner decided to test whether the cowpox virus could be used to protect against smallpox.<br />
In May 1796, Jenner found a young dairy maid, Sarah Nelmes,<br />
&#xa0;who had fresh cowpox lesions on her hand and arm caught from the utters of a cow named Blossom.<br />
Using matter from her pustules,<br />
&#xa0;he inoculated James Phipps, the eight-year-old son of his gardener.<br />
After a few days of fever and discomfort, the boy seemed to recover.<br />
Two months later, Jenner inoculated the boy again,<br />
&#xa0;this time with matter from a fresh smallpox lesion.<br />
No disease developed, and Jenner concluded that protection was complete.<br />
His plan had worked.<br />
Jenner later used the cowpox virus in several other people<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and challenged them repeatedly with smallpox,<br />
&#xa0;proving that they were immune to the disease.<br />
With this procedure, Jenner invented the smallpox vaccination.<br />
<br />
Unlike variolation, which used actual smallpox virus to try to protect people,<br />
&#xa0;vaccination used the far less dangerous cowpox virus.<br />
The medical establishment, cautious then as now,<br />
&#xa0;deliberated at length over his findings before accepting them.<br />
But eventually vaccination was gradually accepted<br />
&#xa0;and variolation became prohibited in England in 1840.<br />
After large vaccination campaigns throughout the 19th and 20th centuries,<br />
&#xa0;the World Health Organization certified smallpox's eradication in 1979.<br />
Jenner is forever remembered as the father of immunology,<br />
&#xa0;but let's not forget the dairy maid Sarah Nelmes, Blossom the cow, and James Phipps,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;all heroes in this great adventure of vaccination who helped eradicate smallpox.<br />

10,000 years ago, a deadly virus called smallpox,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;which spread through the air and attacks many organs of its victims<br />
&#xa0;arose in northeastern Africa.<br />
Up to 30% of infected died during the second week of infection<br />
&#xa0;and survivors bore scars and scabs for the rest of their lives.<br />
In 1350 B.C., the first smallpox epidemics hit<br />
&#xa0;because Egyptian prisoners spread smallpox to their invaders, the Hittites.<br />
As time went on, smallpox arrived all over the world,<br />
&#xa0;which has killed billions of people.<br />
However, smallpox is not unbeatable and its fall started long before modern medicine.<br />
In 1022 AD, a Buddhist nun in Sichuan would grind up smallpox scabs<br />
&#xa0;to blow the powder into the nostrils of healthy people.<br />
It worked pretty well, but up to three percent of inoculated people would still die of the virus.<br />
It was English physician Edward Jenner who found vaccination<br />
&#xa0;that led to the eradication of smallpox.<br />
According to the words of a dairy maid,<br />
&#xa0;he realized that people who have cowpox wouldn't have smallpox.<br />
In May 1796, a young dairy maid, Sarah Nelmes,<br />
&#xa0;was infected with cowpox from the udders of a cow named Blossom.<br />
Using matter from her pustules, he inoculated James Phipps<br />
&#xa0;and challenged him with smallpox to prove that it did work.<br />
He achieved his triumph and repeated it several times.<br />
In the end, the vaccination was gradually accepted.<br />
After large vaccination campaigns,<br />
&#xa0;the World Health Organization certified smallpox eradication in 1979.<br />
