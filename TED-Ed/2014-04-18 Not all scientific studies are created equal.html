Studies have shown that taking vitamins is good for your health and bad for your health.<br />
That newly discovered herb can improve your memory or destroy your liver.<br />
Headlines proclaim a promising new cancer treatment and never mention it again.<br />
On a daily basis, we are bombarded with attention-grabbing news, backed up by scientific studies,<br />
&#xa0;but what are these studies?<br />
How are they performed?<br />
And how do we know whether they're reliable?<br />
<br />
When it comes to dietary or medical information,<br />
&#xa0;the first thing to remember is<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that while studies on animals or individual cells can point the way towards further research,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;the only way to know how something will affect humans<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;is through a study involving human subjects.<br />
And when it comes to human studies,<br />
&#xa0;the scientific gold standard is the randomized clinical trial, or RCT.<br />
The key to RCTs is that the subjects are randomly assigned to their study groups.<br />
They are often blinded to make them more rigorous.<br />
This process attempts to ensure<br />
&#xa0;that the only difference between the groups is the one the researchers are attempting to study.<br />
For example, when testing a new headache medication,<br />
&#xa0;a large pool of people with headaches would be randomly divided into two groups,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;one receiving the medication and another receiving a placebo.<br />
With proper randomization,<br />
&#xa0;the only significant overall difference between the two groups<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;will be whether or not they received the medication,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;rather than other differences that could affect results.<br />
Randomized clinical trials are incredible tools,<br />
&#xa0;and, in fact, the US Food and Drug Administration often requires at least two to be conducted<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;before a new drug can be marketed.<br />
<br />
But the problem is that an RCT is not possible in many cases,<br />
&#xa0;either because it's not practical or would require too many volunteers.<br />
In such cases, scientists use an epidemiological study,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;which simply observes people going about their usual behavior,<br />
&#xa0;rather than randomly assigning active participants to control invariable groups.<br />
Let's say we wanted to study whether an herbal ingredient on the market causes nausea.<br />
Rather than deliberately giving people something that might make them nauseated,<br />
&#xa0;we would find those who already take the ingredient in their everyday lives.<br />
This group is called the cohort.<br />
We would also need a comparison group of people who do not have exposure to the ingredient.<br />
And we would then compare statistics.<br />
If the rate of nausea is higher in the herbal cohort,<br />
&#xa0;it suggests an association between the herbal supplement and nausea.<br />
Epidemiological studies are great tools to study the health effects of almost anything,<br />
&#xa0;without directly interfering in people's lives<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;or assigning them to potentially dangerous exposures.<br />
<br />
So, why can't we rely on these studies<br />
&#xa0;to establish causal relationships between substances and their effects on health?<br />
The problem is that even the best conducted epidemiological studies have inherent flaws.<br />
Precisely because the test subjects are not randomly assigned to their groups.<br />
For example, if the cohort in our herbal study consisted of people<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;who took the supplement for health reasons,<br />
&#xa0;they may have already had higher rates of nausea than the other people in the sample.<br />
Or the cohort group could've been composed of people<br />
&#xa0;who shop at health food stores and have different diets or better access to healthcare.<br />
These factors that can affect results, in addition to the factor being studied,<br />
&#xa0;are known as confounding variables.<br />
These two major pitfalls,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;combined with more general dangers, such as conflicts of interest or selective use of data,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;can make the findings of any particular epidemiological study suspect,<br />
&#xa0;and a good study must go out of its way to prove<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that its authors have taken steps to eliminate these types of errors.<br />
<br />
But even when this has been done,<br />
&#xa0;the very nature of epidemiological studies,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;which examine differences between preexisting groups,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;rather than deliberately inducing changes within the same individuals,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;means that a single study can only demonstrate a correlation<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;between a substance and a health outcome,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;rather than a true cause and effect relationship.<br />
At the end of the day, epidemiological studies have served as excellent guides to public health,<br />
&#xa0;alerting us to critical health hazards, such as smoking, asbestos, lead, and many more.<br />
But these were demonstrated through multiple, well-conducted epidemiological studies,<br />
&#xa0;all pointing in the same direction.<br />
So, the next time you see a headline about a new miracle cure<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;or the terrible danger posed by an everyday substance,<br />
&#xa0;try to learn more about the original study<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;and the limitations inherent in any epidemiological study or clinical trial<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;before jumping to conclusions.<br />
