<h2 id="orgbb44081">2015-03-27 What causes bad breath</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbb44081">
<p class="verse">
There is a curse that has plagued humanity since ancient times.<br />
The Greeks fought it by chewing aromatic resins, while the Chinese resorted to egg shells.<br />
In the ancient Jewish Talmud, it's even considered legal grounds for divorce.<br />
This horrible scourge is halitosis, otherwise known as bad breath.<br />
But what causes it, and why is it so universally terrifying?<br />
Well, think of some of the worst odors you can imagine, like garbage, feces or rotting meat.<br />
All of these smells come from the activity of microorganisms, particularly bacteria,<br />
&#xa0;and, as disgusting as it may sound,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;similar bacteria live in the moisture-rich environment of your mouth.<br />
<br />
Don't panic.<br />
The presence of bacteria in your body is not only normal,<br />
&#xa0;it's actually vital for all sorts of things, like digestion and disease prevention.<br />
But like all living things, bacteria need to eat.<br />
The bacteria in your mouth feed off of mucus, food remnants, and dead tissue cells.<br />
In order to absorb nutrients through their cell membranes,<br />
&#xa0;they must break down the organic matter into much smaller molecules.<br />
For example, they'll break proteins into their component, amino acids<br />
&#xa0;and then break those down even further into various compounds.<br />
Some of the foul-smelling byproducts of these reactions, such as hydrogen sulfide and cadaverine,<br />
&#xa0;escape into the air and waft their way towards unsuspecting noses.<br />
Our sensitivity to these odors and interpretation of them as bad smells<br />
&#xa0;may be an evolutionary mechanism warning us of rotten food and the presence of disease.<br />
<br />
Smell is one of our most intimate and primal senses,<br />
&#xa0;playing a huge role in our attraction to potential mates.<br />
In one poll,<br />
&#xa0;59% of men and 70% of women said they wouldn't go on a date with someone who has bad breath,<br />
&#xa0;which may be why Americans alone spend $1 billion a year on various breath products.<br />
Fortunately, most bad breath is easily treated.<br />
The worst smelling byproducts come from gram-negative bacteria<br />
&#xa0;that live in the spaces between gums and teeth and on the back of the tongue.<br />
By brushing and flossing our teeth,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;using antibacterial mouthwash at bedtime,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;gently cleaning the back of the tongue with a plastic scraper<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;and even just eating a healthy breakfast,<br />
&#xa0;we can remove many of these bacteria and their food sources.<br />
In some cases,<br />
&#xa0;these measures may not be enough due to dental problems, nasal conditions, or rarer ailments,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;such as liver disease and uncontrolled diabetes.<br />
Behaviors like smoking and excessive alcohol consumption also have a very recognizable odor.<br />
Regardless of cause,<br />
&#xa0;the bad smell almost always originates in the mouth and not the stomach or elsewhere in the body.<br />
<br />
But one of the biggest challenges lies in actually determining<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;how our breath smells in the first place,<br />
&#xa0;and it's unclear why.<br />
It may be that we're too acclimatized to the smell inside our own mouths to judge it.<br />
And methods like cupping your hands over your mouth, or licking and smelling your wrist<br />
&#xa0;don't work perfectly either.<br />
One study showed that even when people do this,<br />
&#xa0;they tend to rate the smell subjectively according to how bad they thought it was going to be.<br />
But there's one simple, if socially difficult, way of finding out how your breath smells:<br />
&#xa0;just take a deep breath and ask a friend.<br />
