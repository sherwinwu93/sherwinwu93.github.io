<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2dfff44">
<p class="verse">
<br />
We've all seen movies about terrible insects<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;from outer space or stories of abduction by little green men,<br />
&#xa0;but the study of life in the universe, including the possibility of extraterrestrial life,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;is also a serious, scientific pursuit.<br />
Astrobiology draws on diverse fields, such as physics, biology, astronomy, and geology,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;to study how life was formed on Earth,<br />
&#xa0;how it could form elsewhere, and how we might detect it.<br />
Many ancient religions described other worlds inhabited by known human beings,<br />
&#xa0;but these are more like mythical realms or parallel universes<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;than other planets existing in the same physical world.<br />
It is only within the last century<br />
&#xa0;that scientists have been able to seriously undertake the search for extraterrestrial life.<br />
<br />
We know that at the most basic level organisms on Earth need three things:<br />
&#xa0;liquid water, a source of energy, and organic, carbon-based material.<br />
We also know that the Earth is just the right distance from the Sun,<br />
&#xa0;so as not to be either frozen or molten.<br />
So, planets within such a habitable range from their own stars may be able to support life.<br />
But while we used to think that life could only exist in such Earth-like environments,<br />
&#xa0;one of the most amazing discoveries of astrobiology has been just how versatile life is.<br />
We now know that life can thrive in some of the most extreme environments<br />
&#xa0;that'd be fatal for most known organisms.<br />
Life is found everywhere,<br />
&#xa0;from black smoke of hydrothermal vents in the dark depths of Earth's oceans,<br />
&#xa0;to bubbling, hot, acidic springs on the flanks of volcanoes,<br />
&#xa0;to high-up in the atmosphere.<br />
Organisms that live in these challenging environments are called extremophiles,<br />
&#xa0;and they can survive at extremes of temperature, pressure, and radiation,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;as well as salinity, acidity,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and limited availability of sunlight, water, or oxygen.<br />
What is most remarkable about these extremophiles is<br />
&#xa0;that they are found thriving in environments that mimic those on alien worlds.<br />
<br />
One of the most important of these worlds is our red and dusty neighbor, Mars.<br />
Today, astrobiologists are exploring places<br />
&#xa0;where life might once have existed on Mars using NASA's Curiosity rover.<br />
One of these is Gale Crater,<br />
&#xa0;an impact crater created<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;when a meteor hit the surface of Mars nearly 3.8 billions years ago.<br />
Evidence from orbit suggest past traces of water,<br />
&#xa0;which means the crater might once have supported life.<br />
Planets are not the only places astrobiologists are looking at.<br />
For example, Europa, one of the moons of Jupiter, and Enceladus and Titan, two of Saturn's moons,<br />
&#xa0;are all exciting possibilities.<br />
Although these moons are extremely cold and two are covered in thick ice,<br />
&#xa0;there is evidence of liquid oceans beneath the shell.<br />
Could life be floating around in these oceans,<br />
&#xa0;or could it be living around black smoker vents at the bottom?<br />
Titan is particularly promising<br />
&#xa0;as it has an atmosphere and Earth-like lakes, seas, and rivers flowing across the surface.<br />
It is very cold, however, too cold for liquid water,<br />
&#xa0;so these rivers may instead be flowing with liquid hydrocarbons such as methane and ethane.<br />
These are composed of hydrogen, and, more importantly, carbon,<br />
&#xa0;which is the basic building block of all life as we know it.<br />
So, could life be found in these lakes?<br />
<br />
Although instruments are being designed to study these distant worlds,<br />
&#xa0;it takes many years to build them and even longer to get them where they need to be.<br />
In the meantime, astrobiologists work in our own natural laboratory, the Earth,<br />
&#xa0;to learn about all the weird and wonderful forms of life that can exist<br />
&#xa0;and to help us one day answer one of humanity's oldest questions: Are we alone?<br />

Astrobiology takes advantage of diverse fields, such as physics, biology, astronomy, and geology,<br />
	to study the form of life on Earth and how to detect it.<br />
Although there are many vivid says about other worlds in ancient religious,<br />
	only within the last century<br />
		scientists can undertake the search for extraterrestrial life.<br />
We used to believe that life could only form in Earth-like environments,<br />
	however, astrobiologist makes a discovery<br />
		that extremophiles can survive at extremes of temperature, pressure, and radiation,<br />
			as well as salinity, acidity, and limited availability of sunlight, water, or oxygen.<br />
This environment mimics those on alien worlds.<br />
Not only the planet, Mars, may exist life in Gale Crater which may support life,<br />
	but the moons of some planets proved to have earth-like environments.<br />
Astrobiologists are working to learn about these extremophiles on the earth<br />
	to figure out whether there is extraterrestrial life in outer space.<br />
