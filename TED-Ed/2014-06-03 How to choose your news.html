<h2 id="orgf7d15bb">2014-06-03 How to choose your news</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf7d15bb">
<p class="verse">
How do you know what's happening in your world?<br />
The amount of information just a click away may be limitless,<br />
&#xa0;but the time and energy we have to absorb and evaluate it is not.<br />
All the information in the world won't be very useful unless you know how to read the news.<br />
To your grandparents, parents, or even older siblings, this idea would have sounded strange.<br />
Only a few decades ago, news was broad-based.<br />
Your choices were limited to a couple of general interest magazines and newspaper of record,<br />
&#xa0;and three or four TV networks<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;where trusted newscasters delivered the day's news at the same reliable time every evening.<br />
<br />
But the problems with this system soon became apparent as mass media spread.<br />
While it was known that authoritarian countries controlled and censored information,<br />
&#xa0;a series of scandals showed<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that democratic governments were also misleading the public, often with media cooperation.<br />
Revelations of covert wars, secret assassinations, and political corruption<br />
&#xa0;undermined public faith in official narratives presented by mainstream sources.<br />
This breakdown of trust in media gatekeepers<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;lead to alternative newspapers, radio shows, and cable news<br />
&#xa0;competing with the major outlets and covering events from various perspectives.<br />
More recently, the Internet has multiplied the amount of information and viewpoints,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;with social media, blogs, and online video<br />
&#xa0;turning every citizen into a potential reporter.<br />
But if everyone is a reporter,<br />
&#xa0;nobody is,<br />
&#xa0;and different sources may disagree, not only opinions, but on the facts themselves.<br />
So how do you get the truth, or something close?<br />
<br />
One of the best ways is to get the original news unfiltered by middlemen.<br />
Instead of articles interpreting a scientific study or a politician's speech,<br />
&#xa0;you can often find the actual material and judge for yourself.<br />
For current events, follow reporters on social media.<br />
During major events, such as the Arab Spring or the Ukrainian protests,<br />
&#xa0;newscasters and bloggers have posted updates and recordings from the midst of the chaos.<br />
Though many of these later appear in articles or broadcasts,<br />
&#xa0;keep in mind that these polished versions<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;often combine the voice of the person who was there with the input of editors who weren't.<br />
<br />
At the same time, the more chaotic the story, the less you should try to follow it in real time.<br />
In events like terrorist attacks and natural disasters,<br />
&#xa0;today's media attempts continuous coverage even when no reliable new information is available,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;sometimes leading to incorrect information or false accusations of innocent people.<br />
It's easy to be anxious in such events,<br />
&#xa0;but try checking for the latest information at several points in the day,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;rather than every few minutes,<br />
&#xa0;allowing time for complete details to emerge and false reports to be refuted.<br />
While good journalism aims for objectivity, media bias is often unavoidable.<br />
When you can't get the direct story,<br />
&#xa0;read coverage in multiple outlets<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;which employ different reporters and interview different experts.<br />
Tuning in to various sources and noting the differences<br />
&#xa0;lets you put the pieces together for a more complete picture.<br />
<br />
It's also crucial to separate fact from opinion.<br />
Words like think, likely, or probably<br />
&#xa0;mean that the outlet is being careful or, worse, taking a guess.<br />
And watch out for reports that rely on anonymous sources.<br />
These could be people who have little connection to the story,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;or have an interest in influencing coverage,<br />
&#xa0;their anonymity making them unaccountable for the information they provide.<br />
<br />
Finally, and most importantly, try to verify news before spreading it.<br />
While social media has enabled the truth to reach us faster,<br />
&#xa0;it's also allowed rumors to spread before they can be verified<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and falsehoods to survive long after they've been refuted.<br />
So, before you share that unbelievable or outrageous news item,<br />
&#xa0;do a web search to find any additional information or context you might have missed<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and what others are saying about it.<br />
Today, we are more free than ever from the old media gatekeepers<br />
&#xa0;who used to control the flow of information.<br />
But with freedom comes responsibility:<br />
&#xa0;the responsibility to curate our own experience<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;and ensure that this flow does not become a flood,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;leaving us less informed than before we took the plunge.<br />
