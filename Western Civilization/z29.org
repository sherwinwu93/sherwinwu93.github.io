A barricade of overturned cars in Paris on May 11, 1968
BETWEEN 1945 AND 1965, Europe not only overcame the
devastating effects of World War II but actually experienced an economic recovery that seemed nothing less than miraculous to many
people. Economic growth and virtually full employment continued
so long that the first post--World War II recession in 1973 came as a
shock to Western Europe.
In 1968, Europe had experienced a different kind of shock.
May 1968 is now remembered as a historic month because of a
student revolt in Paris. It erupted at the University of Nanterre
outside Paris but soon spread to the Sorbonne, the main campus
of the University of Paris, where about five hundred students gathered for demonstrations and demanded a greater voice in the administration of the university. The authorities decided to react
with force and arrested a number of the demonstrators, although
as one police officer said, ‘‘To tell the truth, we were not enthusiastic about it if we could avoid it, knowing too well, from experience, that our interventions created more problems than they
solved.’’ Indeed, students fought back, prying up paving stones
from the streets to use as weapons. On May 3, eighty policemen
and about three hundred students were hurt; almost six hundred
were arrested. Demonstrations then spread to other universities,
which served to embolden the students in Paris. On the night of
May 10, barricades, formed by overturning cars, went up in the
streets of Paris. When police moved in to tear down the barricades,
violence ensued. One eyewitness recounted, ‘‘A young girl came
rushing out into the street practically naked and was manhandled
from one cop to another; then beaten like the other wounded
students.’’ Students expanded the scale of their protests by inviting
workers to support them. Half of France’s workforce went on
strike in May 1968. After de Gaulle’s government instituted a hefty
wage hike, the workers returned to work, and the police repressed
the remaining student protesters.
The year 1968 saw widespread student protests around the
world, and for a brief moment, students and radicals everywhere
believed the time had come for a complete renovation of society
and government. But the moment passed, and the Western world
was left with the new order created in the twenty years after World
War II. In Eastern Europe, the crushing of Czechoslovakia in 1968
by Soviet troops left Eastern Europeans with little choice but to
continue as Soviet satellites. In Western Europe, democracies continued to evolve. But everywhere, resignation and stagnation seemed to
prevail as the new order established in the Western world during
the two decades after World War II appeared to have become
permanent: a prosperous, capitalistic West and an impoverished
Communist East.

A Culture of Protest
Q Focus Questions: What were the goals of the revolt in
sexual mores, the youth protest and student revolts,
the feminist movement, and the antiwar protests? To
what extent were their goals achieved?
In the late 1960s, the Western world was rocked by a variety of protest movements relating to sexual mores, education, and women’s rights as well as a strong movement
against the Vietnam War (see ‘‘The Vietnam War’’ later in
this chapter). Although many of the dreams of the protesters were not immediately realized, the forces they set in
motion helped transform Western society.
A Revolt in Sexual Mores
Critics dubbed the society of postwar Europe the permissive society. World War I had opened the first significant crack in the rigid code of manners and morals of
the nineteenth century. The 1920s had witnessed experimentation with drugs, the appearance of pornography,
and a new sexual freedom (police in Berlin, for example,
issued cards that permitted female and male homosexual
prostitutes to practice their trade). But these indications
of a new attitude appeared mostly in major cities and
touched only small numbers of people. After World War II,
changes in manners and morals were far more extensive
and far more noticeable.
Sweden took the lead in the propagation of the socalled sexual revolution of the 1960s. Sex education in
the schools and the decriminalization of homosexuality
were but two aspects of Sweden’s liberal legislation. The
rest of Europe and the United States soon followed
Sweden’s example. A gay rights movement emerged in
California in 1969 and had spread to France, Italy, and
Britain by 1970.
The introduction of the birth control pill, which
became widely available by the mid-1960s, gave people
more freedom in sexual behavior. Meanwhile, sexually
explicit movies, plays, and books broke new ground in the
treatment of once-taboo subjects.
The new standards were evident in the breakdown
of the traditional family. Divorce rates increased dramatically, especially in the 1960s, and premarital and
extramarital sexual experiences also rose substantially. A
survey in the Netherlands in 1968 revealed that 78 percent of men and 86 percent of women had engaged in
extramarital sex. The appearance of Playboy magazine
in the 1950s had also already added a new dimension to
the sexual revolution for adult males. Along with photographs of nude women, Playboy offered well-written
articles on various aspects of masculinity. Playboy’s
message was clear: men were encouraged to seek sexual
gratification outside marriage.
Youth Protest and Student Revolt
The decade of the 1960s also saw the emergence of a drug
culture. For most college and university students, marijuana was the recreational drug of choice. For young
people more interested in mind expansion into higher
levels of consciousness, Timothy Leary, who had done
psychedelic research at Harvard on the effects of LSD
(lysergic acid diethylamide), became the high priest of
hallucinogenic experiences.
New attitudes toward sex and the use of drugs were
only two manifestations of a growing youth movement in
the 1960s that questioned authority and fostered rebellion
against the older generation. Spurred on by opposition to
the Vietnam War and a growing political consciousness,
the youth rebellion became a full-fledged protest movement by the second half of the 1960s (see the box on
p. 634).
Before World War II, higher education had largely
remained the preserve of Europe’s wealthier classes. After
the war, European states began to foster greater equality
of opportunity in higher education by reducing or
eliminating fees, and universities experienced an influx of
students from the middle and lower classes. Enrollments
grew dramatically; in France, 4.5 percent of young people
attended a university in 1950. By 1965, the figure had
increased to 14.5 percent.
But there were problems. Classrooms with too
many students, professors who paid little attention to
their students, administrators who acted in an authoritarian fashion, and an education that to many seemed
irrelevant to the modern age led to an outburst of
student revolts in the late 1960s. In part, these protests were
an extension of the spontaneous disruptions in American
universities in the mid-1960s, which were often sparked
by student opposition to the Vietnam War. Perhaps the
most famous student revolt occurred in France in 1968, as
noted in the introduction to this chapter.
The student protest movement reached its high point
in 1968, although scattered incidents lasted into the early
1970s. There were several reasons for the student radicalism. Some students were genuinely motivated by the
desire to reform the university. Others were protesting
the Vietnam War, which they viewed as a product of
Western imperialism. They also attacked other aspects
of Western society, such as its materialism, and expressed
concern about becoming cogs in the large and impersonal
bureaucratic jungles of the modern world. For many
students, the calls for democratic decision making within
the universities were a reflection of their deeper concerns
about the direction of Western society. Although the
student revolts fizzled out in the 1970s, the larger issues
they raised revived in the 1990s.
The Feminist Movement
By the late 1960s, women began to assert their rights and
speak as feminists. Along with the student upheavals of
the late 1960s came renewed interest in feminism, or the
women’s liberation movement, as it was now called. Increasingly, women protested that the acquisition of political and legal equality had not brought true equality
with men: In the words of a British ‘‘women’s liberation
workshop’’ in 1969:
We are economically oppressed: in jobs we do full work
for half pay, in the home we do unpaid work full time.
We are commercially exploited by advertisement, television,
and the press; legally, we often have only the status of
children. We are brought up to feel inadequate, educated
to narrower horizons than men. This is our specific oppression as women. It is as women that we are, therefore,
organizing.1
An important contributor to the growth of the
women’s movement in the 1960s was Betty Friedan (1921--
2006). A journalist and the mother of three children,
Friedan grew increasingly uneasy with her attempt to
fulfill the traditional role of the ‘‘ideal housewife and
mother.’’ In 1963, she published The Feminine Mystique,
in which she analyzed the problems of middle-class
American women in the 1950s and argued that women
were being denied equality with men. She wrote, ‘‘The
problem that has no name---which is simply the fact that
American women are kept from growing to their full
human capacities---is taking a far greater toll on the
physical and mental health of our country than any
known disease.’’2
The Feminine Mystique became a best-seller and
propelled Friedan into a newfound celebrity. In 1966, she
founded the National Organization for Women (NOW),
whose stated goal was to take ‘‘action to bring women
into full participation in the mainstream of American
society now, exercising all the privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men.’’
Friedan’s voice was also prominent in calling for the addition to the U.S. Constitution of an amendment
guaranteeing equal rights for women.
Antiwar Protests
One of the major issues that mobilized youthful European protesters was the U.S. war in Vietnam, which they
viewed as an act of aggression and imperialism. In 1968,
demonstrations broke out in universities in Italy, France,
and Britain. In London, thirty thousand demonstrators
took to the streets protesting America’s war in Vietnam.
But student protests in Europe also backfired in that they
provoked a reaction from people who favored order over
the lawlessness of privileged young people. As Pier Paolo
Pasolini, an Italian poet and intellectual, wrote, ‘‘Now all
the journalists of the world are licking your arses . . . but
not me, my dears. You have the faces of spoiled brats, and
I hate you, like I hate your fathers. . . . When yesterday at
Valle Giulia [in Rome] you beat up the police, I sympathized with the police because they are the sons of the
poor.’’3
Antiwar protests also divided the American people
after President Lyndon Johnson sent American troops to
war in Vietnam. As the war dragged on and a military
draft ensued, protests escalated. Teach-ins, sit-ins, and
the occupation of buildings at universities alternated
with more radical demonstrations that led to violence.
The killing of four student protesters at Kent State University in 1970 by the Ohio National Guard caused a
reaction, and the antiwar movement began to decline. By
that time, however, antiwar demonstrations had worn
down the willingness of many Americans to continue the
war. The combination of antiwar demonstrations and
ghetto riots in the cities also heightened the appeal of a
call for ‘‘law and order,’’ used by Richard Nixon, the Republican presidential candidate in 1968.
A Divided Western World
Q Focus Question: What were the major political
developments in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe,
Western Europe, and the United States between 1965
and 1985?
Between 1945 and 1965, economic recovery had brought
renewed growth to Europe. Nevertheless, the political
divisions between Western and Eastern Europe remained;
so did disparities in prosperity.
Stagnation in the Soviet Union
Between 1964 and 1982, significant change in the Soviet
Union seemed highly unlikely. After the overthrow of
Khrushchev in 1964, Leonid Brezhnev (1906--1982) had
become head of both the Communist Party and the state.
He was optimistic but reluctant to reform. The Brezhnev
Doctrine---the right of the Soviet Union to intervene
if socialism was threatened in another socialist state---
became an article of faith and led to the use of Soviet
troops in Czechoslovakia in 1968.
The Brezhnev Years Brezhnev benefited from the more
relaxed atmosphere associated with de´tente (see ‘‘The
Cold War: The Move to De´tente’’ later in this chapter).
The Soviets had reached a rough parity with the United
States in nuclear arms and enjoyed a sense of external
security that seemed to allow for a relaxation of authoritarian rule. The regime permitted more access to Western
styles of music, dress, and art, although dissenters were
still punished.
In his economic policies, Brezhnev continued to
emphasize heavy industry. Overall industrial growth
declined, although the Soviet production of iron, steel,
coal, and cement surpassed that of the United States.
Two problems bedeviled the Soviet economy. The
government’s insistence on vigorous central planning
led to a huge, complex bureaucracy that discouraged
efficiency and reduced productivity. Moreover, the Soviet system, based on guaranteed employment and a lack
of incentives, bred apathy, complacency, absenteeism, and
drunkenness. Agricultural problems added to Soviet economic woes. Bad harvests in the mid-1970s, caused by a
series of droughts, heavy rains, and early frosts, forced the
Soviet government to buy grain from the West, particularly
the United States.
By the 1970s, Party and state leaders---as well as
leaders of the army and the secret police (KGB)---had
come to expect numerous privileges. Brezhnev was unwilling to tamper with the Party leadership and state
bureaucracy despite the inefficiency and corruption the
system encouraged. By 1980, the Soviet Union was ailing.
A declining economy, a rise in infant mortality rates, a
dramatic surge in alcoholism, and a deterioration in
working conditions all gave impetus to a decline in morale and a growing perception that the system was
foundering. Within the Party, a small group of reformers
emerged who understood the real condition of the Soviet
Union, including a young visionary, Mikhail Gorbachev,
who was climbing the rungs of the Party ladder. When
Party leaders chose Gorbachev as Party secretary in March
1985, an astonishing new era began (see Chapter 30).
Conformity in Eastern Europe
As we saw in Chapter 28, the attempt of the Poles and
Hungarians to gain their freedom from Soviet domination had been repressed in 1956. This year of discontent
had consequences, however. Soviet leaders now recognized that Moscow could maintain control over its satellites in Eastern Europe only by granting them leeway to
adopt domestic policies appropriate to local conditions.
As a result, Eastern European Communist leaders now
adopted reform programs to make socialism more acceptable to their subject populations.
In Poland, continued worker unrest led to the rise of
the independent labor movement called Solidarity. Led by
Lech Walesa (b. 1943), Solidarity gained the support of
the workers, many intellectuals, and the Catholic church
and was able to win a series of concessions. The Polish
government seemed powerless to stop the flow of concessions until December 1981, when it arrested Walesa
and other Solidarity leaders, outlawed the union, and
imposed military rule.
The government of Ja´nos Ka´da´r (1912--1989) in
Hungary enacted the most far-reaching reforms in Eastern
Europe. In the early 1960s, Kadar legalized small private
enterprises, such as retail stores, restaurants, and artisan
shops. His economic reforms were termed ‘‘communism
with a capitalist facelift.’’ Under his leadership, Hungary
moved slowly away from its strict adherence to Soviet
dominance and even established fairly friendly relations
with the West.
The Prague Spring Czechoslovakia did not share in the
thaw of the mid-1950s and remained under the rule of
Antonin Novotny (1904--1975), who had been placed in
power by Stalin himself. By the late 1960s, however,
Novotny had alienated many members of his own
party and was particularly resented by Czechoslovakia’s
writers, including the playwright Va´clav Havel (b. 1936).
A writers’ rebellion late in 1967, in fact, led to Novotny’s
resignation. In January 1968, Alexander Dubcˇek (1921--
1992) was elected first secretary of the Communist Party
and soon introduced a number of reforms, including
freedom of speech and of the press, freedom to travel
abroad, and a relaxation of secret police activities. Dubcˇek
hoped to create ‘‘communism with a human face.’’ A
period of euphoria erupted that came to be known as the
‘‘Prague Spring.’’
It proved short-lived. To forestall the spreading of
this ‘‘spring’’ fever, the Red Army invaded Czechoslovakia
in August 1968 and crushed the reform movement.
Gustav Husa´k (1913--1991), a committed nonreformist,
replaced Dubcˇek, abolished his reforms, and reestablished
the old order.
Repression in East Germany and Romania Elsewhere
in Eastern Europe, Stalinist policies continued to hold
sway. In the early 1950s, the ruling Communist government in East Germany, led by Walter Ulbricht, had
consolidated its position and become a faithful Soviet
satellite. Industry was nationalized and agriculture
collectivized. After a workers’ revolt in 1953 was
crushed by Soviet tanks, a steady flight of East Germans
to West Germany ensued, primarily through the divided city of Berlin. This exodus of mostly skilled laborers led the East German government in 1961 to
build the infamous Berlin Wall separating West from
East Berlin. After building the wall, East Germany
succeeded in developing the strongest economy among
the Soviet Union’s Eastern European satellites. In 1971,
Ulbricht was succeeded by Erich Honecker (1912--
1992), a party hard-liner who made use of the Stasi, the
secret police, to rule with an iron fist for the next
eighteen years.
Repression was also an important part of Romania’s
postwar history. By 1948, with Soviet assistance, the
Communist People’s Democratic Front had
assumed complete power in Romania. In
1965, leadership of the Communist government passed into the hands of Nicolae
Ceaus ¸escu (1918--1989), who with his wife,
Elena, established a rigid and dictatorial
regime. Ceaus ¸escu ruled Romania with an
iron grip, using a secret police force---the
Securitate---as his personal weapon against
dissent.
Western Europe:
The Winds of Change
After two decades of incredible economic
growth, Europe experienced severe economic recessions in 1973--1974 and 1979--
1983. Both inflation and unemployment
rose dramatically. A substantial increase in
the price of oil in 1973 was a major cause
for the first downturn. Moreover, a
worldwide recession had led to a decline in
demand for European goods. The economies of the Western European states
recovered in the course of the 1980s, although problems
remained.
West Germany After the Adenauer era, West German
voters moved politically from the center-right politics of
the Christian Democrats to center-left politics, and in
1969, the Social Democrats became the leading party. The
first Social Democratic chancellor was Willy Brandt
(1913--1992). Brandt was especially successful with his
‘‘opening toward the east’’ (known as Ostpolitik), for
which he received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1972. In that
year, Brandt made a treaty with East Germany that
called for ‘‘good neighborly’’ relations, which led to
greater cultural, personal, and economic contacts between West and East Germany.
Brandt’s successor, Helmut Schmidt (b. 1918), was
more of a technocrat than a reform-minded socialist and
concentrated primarily on the economic problems largely
brought about by high oil prices between 1973 and 1975.
Schmidt was successful in eliminating a deficit of 10 billion marks in three years. In 1982, when the coalition of
Schmidt’s Social Democrats with the Free Democrats fell
apart over a reduction of social welfare expenditures,
the Free Democrats joined with the Christian Democratic Union of Helmut Kohl (b. 1930) to form a new
government.
Great Britain: Thatcher and Thatcherism Between
1964 and 1979, the Conservative and Labour Parties alternated in power. Neither could solve the problem of
fighting between Catholics and Protestants in Northern
Ireland. Violence increased as the Irish Republican Army
(IRA) staged a series of dramatic terrorist acts in response
to the suspension of Northern Ireland’s parliament in
1972 and the establishment of direct rule by London. Nor
was either party able to deal with Britain’s ailing economy. Failure to modernize made British industry less and
less competitive. Moreover, Britain was hampered by
frequent labor strikes, many of them caused by conflicts
between rival labor unions.
In 1979, the Conservatives returned to power under
Margaret Thatcher (b. 1925), who became the first
woman to serve as prime minister in British history (see
the box on p. 639). Thatcher pledged to lower taxes,
reduce government bureaucracy, limit social welfare,
restrict union power, and end inflation. The ‘‘Iron
Lady,’’ as she was called, did break the power of the
labor unions. Although she did not eliminate the basic
components of the social welfare system, she did use
austerity measures to control inflation. ‘‘Thatcherism,’’
as her economic policy was termed, improved the
British economic situation, but at a price. The south of
England, for example, prospered, but the old industrial
areas of the Midlands and north declined and were
beset by high unemployment, poverty, and sporadic
violence.
In foreign policy, Thatcher, like Ronald Reagan in the
United States, took a hard-line approach toward communism. She oversaw a large military buildup aimed at
replacing older technology and reestablishing Britain as a
world police officer. In 1982, when Argentina attempted
to take control of the Falkland Islands (one of Britain’s
few remaining colonial outposts, known to Argentines as
the Malvinas) 300 miles off its coast, the British successfully rebuffed the Argentines.
Uncertainties in France The worsening of France’s
economic situation in the 1970s brought a shift to the left
politically. By 1981, the Socialists had become the dominant party in the National Assembly, and the Socialist
leader, Franc¸ois Mitterrand (1916--1995), was elected
president. His first concern was with France’s economic
difficulties. In 1982, Mitterrand froze prices and wages in
the hope of reducing the huge budget deficit and high
inflation. He also passed a number of liberal measures to
aid workers: an increased minimum wage, expanded
social benefits, a mandatory fifth week of paid vacation
for salaried workers, a thirty-nine-hour workweek, and
higher taxes for the rich. Mitterrand’s administrative reforms included both centralization (nationalization of
banks and industry) and decentralization (granting local
governments greater powers). The party’s victory had
convinced the Socialists that they could enact some of
their more radical reforms. Consequently, the government nationalized the steel industry, major banks, the
space and electronics industries, and important insurance
firms.
The Socialist policies largely failed, however, and
within three years, a decline in support for the Socialists
caused the Mitterrand government to turn portions of
the economy back over to private enterprise. Some
economic improvement in the late 1980s enabled Mitterrand to win a second seven-year term in the 1988
presidential elections.

The European Community
After 1970, Western European states continued to pursue
the goal of integrating their economies. Beginning with
six states in 1957, the European Economic Community
expanded in 1973 when Great Britain, Ireland, and
Denmark joined what its members now renamed the
European Community (EC). Greece joined in 1981, followed by Spain and Portugal in 1986. The economic integration of the members of the EC led to cooperative
efforts in international and political affairs as well. The
foreign ministers of the twelve members consulted frequently and provided a common front in negotiations on
important issues.
The United States: Turmoil and Tranquillity
With the election of Richard Nixon (1913--1994) as
president in 1968, American politics made a shift to the
right. Nixon ended American involvement in Vietnam
by 1973 by gradually withdrawing American troops.
Politically, he pursued a ‘‘southern strategy,’’ carefully
calculating that ‘‘law and order’’ issues and a slowdown
in racial desegregation would appeal to southern whites.
The South, which had once been a Democratic
stronghold, began to form a new allegiance to the Republican Party.
As president, Nixon was paranoid about conspiracies
and began to use illegal methods to gather intelligence on
his political opponents. One of the president’s advisers
explained that their intention was to ‘‘use the available
federal machinery to screw our political enemies.’’ Nixon’s
zeal led to the Watergate scandal---the attempted bugging
of Democratic National Headquarters, located in the
Watergate apartment and hotel complex in Washington,
D.C. Although Nixon repeatedly lied to the American
public about his involvement in the affair, secret tapes of
his own conversations in the White House revealed the
truth. On August 9, 1974, Nixon resigned the presidency
rather than face possible impeachment and then trial by
the U.S. Congress.
Economic Problems After Watergate, American domestic politics focused on economic issues. Vice President
Gerald Ford (1913--2006) became president when Nixon
resigned, only to lose in the 1976 election to the former
governor of Georgia, Jimmy Carter (b. 1924). Both Ford
and Carter faced severe economic problems. The period
from 1973 to the mid-1980s was one of economic stagnation, which came to be known as stagflation---a combination of high inflation and high unemployment. In
part, the economic downturn stemmed from a dramatic
change in oil prices. An oil embargo and price increases
by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) cartel in the aftermath of the Arab-Israeli War
in 1973 quadrupled oil prices. Additional price hikes
increased oil prices twenty-fold by the end of the 1970s,
encouraging inflationary tendencies throughout the
economy.
By 1980, the Carter administration faced two devastating problems. High inflation and a noticeable decline
in average weekly earnings were causing a drop in
American living standards. At the same time, a crisis
abroad had erupted when fifty-three Americans were
taken hostage by the Iranian government of Ayatollah
Khomeini. Carter’s inability to gain the release of the
hostages led to perceptions at home that he was a weak
president. His overwhelming loss to Ronald Reagan
(1911--2004) in the election of 1980 enabled the chief
exponent of right-wing Republican policies to assume the
presidency and initiate a new political order.
The Reagan Revolution The Reagan Revolution, as it
has been called, consisted of a number of new policies.
Reversing decades of increased spending on social welfare, Reagan cut back on the welfare state by reducing
spending on food stamps, school lunch programs, and
job programs. At the same time, his administration
fostered the largest peacetime military buildup in
American history. Total federal spending rose from $631
billion in 1981 to over $1 trillion by 1986. But instead of
raising taxes to pay for the new expenditures, which far
outweighed the budget cuts in social areas, Reagan
convinced Congress to rely on ‘‘supply-side economics.’’
Massive tax cuts would supposedly stimulate rapid
economic growth and produce new revenues. Much of
the tax cut went to the wealthy. Reagan’s policies seemed
to work in the short run as the United States experienced
an economic upturn that lasted until the end of the
1980s. The spending policies of the Reagan administration, however, also produced record government
deficits, which loomed as an obstacle to long-term
growth. In the 1970s, the total deficit was $420 billion.
Between 1981 and 1987, Reagan’s budget deficits were
three times that amount.
Canada
In 1963, during a major economic recession, the Liberals
had been returned to power in Canada. The most
prominent Liberal government was that of Pierre Trudeau (1919--2000), who came to power in 1968. Although French Canadian in background, Trudeau was
dedicated to Canada’s federal union, and in 1968, his
government passed the Official Languages Act that allowed both English and French to be used in the federal
civil service. Although Trudeau’s government vigorously
pushed an industrialization program, high inflation and
Trudeau’s efforts to impose the will of the federal government on the powerful provincial governments alienated voters and undermined his popularity. Economic
recession in the early 1980s brought Brian Mulroney
(b. 1939), leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, to
power in 1984.
The Cold War: The Move
to De´tente
Q Focus Question: What were the main events in the
Cold War between 1965 and 1985, and how important
was the role of de´tente in those events?
The Cuban Missile Crisis (described in Chapter 28) led to
a lessening of tensions between the United States and the
Soviet Union. But within another year, the United States
had been drawn into a new confrontation that had an
important impact on the Cold War: the war in Vietnam
(see Film & History: Dr. Strangelove on p. 641).
The Vietnam War
In 1964, under President Lyndon B. Johnson (1908--1973),
increasing numbers of U.S. troops were sent to Vietnam
to keep the Communist regime of
the north from
uniting the entire
country under its
control. Although
nationalism played
a powerful role in
this conflict, American policy makers
saw it in terms of
a domino theory
concerning the spread
of communism. If
the Communists
succeeded in Vietnam, the argument
went, all the other
countries in Asia
freeing themselves from colonial domination would fall,
like dominoes, to communism.
Despite their massive superiority in equipment and
firepower, U.S. forces failed to prevail over the persistence
of the North Vietnamese and especially the Vietcong.
These guerrilla forces were extremely effective against
American troops. Natives of Vietnam, they were able to
live off the land, disappear among the people, and attack
when least expected. Many South Vietnamese villagers
were so opposed to their own government that they
sheltered and supported the Vietcong.
The mounting destruction and increasing brutalization of the war, brought into American homes every
evening on television, also turned American public opinion against the war. Finally, in 1973, President Richard
Nixon reached an agreement with North Vietnam that
allowed the United States to withdraw its forces. Within
two years, Vietnam had been forcibly reunited by Communist armies from the North.
Despite the success of the North Vietnamese Communists, the domino theory proved unfounded. A noisy
rupture between Communist China and the Soviet Union
put an end to the idea of a monolithic communism directed by Moscow. Under President Nixon, American
relations with China were resumed. New nations in
Southeast Asia also managed to avoid Communist governments. Above all, Vietnam helped show the limitations
of American power. By the end of the Vietnam War, a
new era in American-Soviet relations, known as de´tente,
had begun to emerge.

China and the Cold War
The Johnson administration had sent U.S. combat troops
to South Vietnam in 1965 in an effort to prevent the expansion of communism in Southeast Asia. The primary
concern of the United States, however, was not the Soviet
Union but Communist China. By the mid-1960s, U.S.
officials viewed the Soviet Union as an essentially conservative power, more concerned with protecting its vast
empire than with expanding its borders. Mao Zedong’s
attempt to create a totally classless society had received
much attention, and despite his failures with the Great
Leap Forward (see Chapter 28), he now launched China on
an even more dramatic forced march toward communism.
The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution Mao was
convinced that only an atmosphere of constant revolutionary fervor could enable the Chinese to overcome the
past and achieve the final stage of communism. Accordingly, in 1966 he unleashed the Red Guards, revolutionary
units composed of unhappy Communist Party members
and discontented young people who were urged to take to
the streets to cleanse Chinese society of impure elements
guilty of taking the capitalist road. Schools, universities,
factories, and even government ministries were all subject
to the scrutiny of the Red Guards. This so-called Great
Proletarian Cultural Revolution (literally, the Chinese
name translates as ‘‘great revolution to create a proletarian culture’’) lasted for ten years, from 1966 to 1976. Red
Guards set out across the nation to eliminate the ‘‘four
olds’’---old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits.
They destroyed temples, books written by foreigners, and
jazz records.
Mao found, however, that it was not easy to maintain a constant mood of revolutionary enthusiasm. Key
groups, including Party members, urban professionals,
and many military officers, did not share Mao’s desire for
‘‘permanent revolution.’’ People began to turn against the
movement, and in September 1976, when Mao died, a
group of practical-minded reformers seized power from
the radicals and adopted a more rational approach to
China’s problems.
U.S.-China Relations For years, U.S. policy toward
Communist China was determined by American fears of
Communist expansion in Asia. Already in 1950, the
Truman administration had adopted a new national
policy that implied that the United States would take
whatever steps were necessary to stem expansion of
communism in the region, a policy that Truman invoked
when he sent troops to Korea in 1950 (see ‘‘The Korean
War’’ in Chapter 28). The Vietnam War raised additional
concerns about Communist China’s intentions.
President Richard Nixon, however, opened a new
door in American relations when he visited China and
met with Mao in 1972. Despite Nixon’s reputation as a
devout anti-Communist, the visit was a success as the two
leaders agreed to put aside their most bitter differences in
an effort to reduce tensions in Asia. During the 1970s,
Chinese-American relations continued to improve. In
1979, diplomatic ties were established between the two
countries, and by the end of the 1970s, China and the
United States had forged a ‘‘strategic relationship’’ in
which they would cooperate against the threat of Soviet
intervention in Asia.
The Practice of De´tente
By the 1970s, American-Soviet relations had entered a
new phase known as de´tente, marked by a reduction of
tensions between the two superpowers. An appropriate
symbol of de´tente was the Antiballistic Missile Treaty,
signed in 1972, in which the two nations agreed to limit
their systems for launching antiballistic missiles (ABMs).
The U.S. objective in pursuing the treaty was to make it
unlikely that either superpower could win a nuclear exchange by launching a preemptive strike against the other.
U.S. officials believed that a policy of ‘‘equivalence,’’ in
which there was a roughly equal power balance on each
side, was the best way to avoid a nuclear confrontation.
In 1975, the Helsinki Agreements provided yet another example of reduced tensions between the superpowers. Signed by the United States, Canada, and all
European nations, these accords recognized all borders
that had been established in Europe since the end of
World War II, thereby acknowledging the Soviet sphere of
influence in Eastern Europe. The Helsinki Agreements
also committed the signatory powers to recognize and
protect the human rights of their citizens.
The Limits of De´tente
This protection of human rights became one of the major
foreign policy goals of the next American president,
Jimmy Carter. Although hopes ran high for the continuation of de´tente, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in
1979, undertaken to restore a pro-Soviet regime, hardened relations between the United States and the Soviet
Union. President Carter canceled American participation
in the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow and placed an
embargo on the shipment of American grain to the Soviet
Union.
The early administration of President Ronald Reagan
witnessed a return to the harsh rhetoric, if not all of the
harsh practices, of the Cold War. Calling the Soviet Union
an ‘‘evil empire,’’ Reagan began a military buildup that
stimulated a renewed arms race. By providing military
support to the anti-Soviet insurgents in Afghanistan, the
Reagan administration helped maintain a Vietnam-like
war in Afghanistan that would embed the Soviet Union in
its own quagmire. Like the Vietnam War, the conflict in
Afghanistan resulted in heavy casualties and demonstrated that the influence of a superpower was limited in
the face of strong nationalist, guerrilla-type opposition.
Society and Culture
in the Western World
Q Focus Question: What were the major social and
cultural developments in the Western world between
1965 and 1985?
Dramatic social and cultural developments accompanied
political and economic changes after 1965. Even as scientific and technological achievements began to revolutionize people’s lives, environmental problems were
becoming increasingly apparent. Intellectually and culturally, the Western world after 1965 was notable for its
diversity and innovation. New directions led some observers to speak of a ‘‘postmodern’’ cultural world.
The World of Science and Technology
During World War II, university scientists were recruited
to work for their governments and develop new weapons
and practical instruments of war. British physicists played
a crucial role in the development of an improved radar
system in 1940 that helped defeat the German air force in
the Battle of Britain. German scientists designed selfpropelled rockets and jet airplanes to keep Hitler’s hopes
alive for a miraculous turnaround in the war. The computer, too, was a wartime creation. The British mathematician Alan Turing designed a primitive computer to
assist British intelligence in breaking the secret codes of
German ciphering machines. The most famous product
of wartime scientific research was the atomic bomb,
created by a team of American and European scientists
under the guidance of the American physicist J. Robert
Oppenheimer. Obviously, most wartime devices were
created for destructive purposes, but merely to mention
computers and jet airplanes demonstrates that they could
easily be adapted for peacetime uses.
The Computer The alliance of science and technology
has led to an accelerated rate of change that has become
a fact of life in Western society. One product of this
alliance---the computer---may be the most revolutionary
of all the technological inventions of the twentieth
century. Early computers, which required thousands of
vacuum tubes to function, were large and took up considerable space. An important figure in the development
of the early computer was Grace Hopper (1906--1992), a
career Navy officer. Hopper was instrumental in inventing
COBOL, a computer language that enabled computers to
respond to words as well as numbers.
The development of the transistor and then the silicon chip produced a revolutionary new approach to
computers. In 1971, the invention of the microprocessor,
a machine that combined the equivalent of thousands of
transistors on a single, tiny silicon chip, opened the road
for the development of the personal computer.
Dangers of Science and Technology Despite the
marvels that were produced by the alliance of science and
technology, some people came to question the underlying
assumption of this alliance---that scientific knowledge gave
human beings the ability to manipulate the environment
for their benefit. They maintained that some technological
advances had far-reaching side effects damaging to the
environment. For example, the chemical fertilizers that
were touted for producing larger crops wreaked havoc
with the ecological balance of streams, rivers, and woodlands. Small Is Beautiful, written by the British economist
E. F. Schumacher (1911--1977), was a fundamental critique of the dangers of the new science and technology
(see the box on p. 645). The proliferation of fouled
beaches and dying forests and lakes made environmentalism one of the important issues of the late twentieth
century.
The Environment and the Green Movements
By the 1970s, serious ecological problems had become all
too apparent. Air pollution, produced by nitrogen oxide
and sulfur dioxide emissions from road vehicles, power
plants, and industrial factories, was causing respiratory
illnesses and having corrosive effects on buildings and
monuments. Many rivers, lakes, and seas had become so
polluted that they posed serious health risks. Dying forests
and disappearing wildlife alarmed more and more people.
A nuclear power disaster at Chernobyl in the Ukrainian
Soviet Socialist Republic in 1986 made Europeans even
more aware of potential environmental hazards. The
opening of Eastern Europe after the revolutions of 1989
(see Chapter 30) brought to the world’s attention the incredible environmental destruction of that region caused
by unfettered industrial pollution. Environmental concerns
forced the major political parties in Europe to advocate
new regulations for the protection of the environment.
Growing ecological awareness also gave rise to the
Green movements and Green parties that emerged
throughout Europe in the 1970s. Most started at the local
level and then gradually expanded to include activities at
the national level, where they became formally organized
as political parties. Green parties competed successfully in
Sweden, Austria, and Switzerland. Most visible was the
Green Party in Germany, which was officially organized in
1979 and by 1987 had elected forty-two delegates to the
West German parliament. In 1998, when the Green Party
became a coalition partner with the Socialists under
Gerhard Schroeder, one of the Green Party members,
Joschka Fischer, became the nation’s foreign minister.
Although the Green movements and parties have
played an important role in making people aware of
ecological problems, they have not replaced the traditional political parties, as some political analysts in the
mid-1980s forecast. For one thing, the coalitions that
made up the Greens found it difficult to agree on all issues and tended to splinter into cliques. Moreover, traditional political parties co-opted the environmental
issues of the Greens. More and more European
governments began to sponsor projects to safeguard the
environment and clean up the worst sources of pollution.
Postmodern Thought
The term Postmodern covers a variety of artistic and intellectual styles and ways of thinking prominent since the
1970s. In the broadest sense, Postmodernism rejects the
modern Western belief in an objective truth and instead
focuses on the relative nature of reality and knowledge.
While existentialism wrestled with notions of meaning and existence, a group of French philosophers in the
1960s attempted to understand how meaning and
knowledge operate through the study of language and
signs. Poststructuralism, or deconstruction, which was
formulated by Jacques Derrida (1930--2004), believes that
culture is created and can therefore be analyzed in a variety of ways, according to the manner in which people
create their own meaning. Hence there is no fixed truth
or universal meaning.
Michel Foucault (1926--1984) likewise used poststructural concepts to explore relationships of power.
Believing that ‘‘power is exercised rather than possessed,’’
Foucault argued that the diffusion of power and oppression marks all relationships. For example, any act of
teaching entails components of assertion and submission,
as the student adopts the ideas of the person in power.
Therefore, all norms are culturally produced and entail
some degree of power struggle.
Trends in Art, Literature, and Music
Beginning in the 1960s and continuing well into the 1980s,
styles emerged that some have referred to as ‘‘Postmodern.’’
Postmodernism tends to move away from the futurism or
‘‘cutting-edge’’ qualities of Modernism. Instead it favors
‘‘tradition,’’ whether that means using earlier styles of
painting or elevating traditional crafts to the level of fine
art. Weavers, potters, glassmakers, metalsmiths, and furniture makers have gained respect as artists. Postmodern
artists and architects frequently blur the distinction between the arts, creating works that include elements of film,
performance, popular culture, sculpture, and architecture.
Art In the 1960s and 1970s, artists often rejected the
notion of object-based artworks. Instead, performances
and installations that were either too fleeting or too large
to appear in the traditional context of a museum were
produced. Allen Kaprow (1927--2006) suggested that
‘‘happenings,’’ works of art rooted in performance, grew
out of Jackson Pollock’s process of action painting. Rather
than producing abstract paintings, however, Kaprow created events that were not scripted but chance occurrences.
These ‘‘happenings’’ often included audience participation.
Postmodernism’s eclectic mixing of past tradition
with Modernist innovation became increasingly evident
in architecture. One example is provided by Charles
Moore (1929--1993). His Piazza d’Italia (1976--1980) in
New Orleans is an outdoor plaza that combines classical
columns with stainless steel and neon lights. This
blending of modern-day materials with historical references distinguished the Postmodern architecture of the
late 1970s and 1980s from the Modernist glass box.
Another Postmodern response to Modernism can be
seen in a return to Realism in the arts, a movement called
Photorealism. Some Photorealists paint or sculpt with
such minute attention to detail that their paintings appear to be photographs and their sculptures living human
beings. Their subjects are often ordinary individuals,
stuck in ordinary lives, demonstrating the Postmodern
emphasis on low culture and the commonplace rather
than the ambitious nature of high art.
Literature Postmodernism was also evident in literature. European Postmodernism is well represented by
the work of the Czech writer Milan Kundera (b. 1929).
Kundera blended fantasy with realism, using fantasy to
examine moral issues while remaining optimistic about the
human condition. Indeed, in his novel The Unbearable
Lightness of Being (1984), Kundera does not despair because of the political repression in his native Czechoslovakia that he so aptly describes but allows his characters to
use love as a way to a better life. The human spirit can be
diminished but not destroyed.
Music Like modern art, modern music has focused on
variety and radical experimentation. The major musical
trend since the war has been serialism. Serialism is a
compositional procedure in which an order of succession
is set for specific values: pitch (for tones of the tempered
scale), loudness (for dynamic levels), and units of time
(for rhythm). By predetermining the order of succession,
the composer restricts his or her intuitive freedom as the
work to some extent creates itself.
An offshoot of serialism that has won popular support, but not the same critical favor, is minimalism. Like
serialism, this style uses repeated patterns and series and
steady pulsation with gradual changes occurring over
time. But whereas serialism is often atonal, minimalism
is usually tonal and more harmonic. Perhaps the
most successful minimalist composer is Philip Glass
(b. 1937), who demonstrated in Einstein on the Beach
that minimalist music could be adapted to full-scale
opera. Like other modern American composers, Glass
found no contradiction in moving between the worlds of
classical music and popular music. His Koyaanisqatsi was
used as background music to a documentary film on the
disintegrative forces in Western society.
Popular Culture: Image and Globalization
The period from 1967 to 1973 was probably the true golden
age of rock. During this brief period, much experimentation in rock music took place, as it did in society in general.
Straightfoward rock-and-roll competed with a new hybrid
blues rock, created in part by British performers such as the
Rolling Stones, who were in turn inspired by African
American blues artists. Many musicians also experimented
with non-Western musical sounds, such as Indian sitars.
Some of the popular music of the 1960s also focused on
social issues. It was against the Vietnam War and materialism and promoted ‘‘peace and love’’ as alternatives to the
prevailing ‘‘establishment’’ culture.
The introduction of the video music channel MTV in
the early 1980s radically changed the music scene by
making image as important as sound in selling records.
Artists like Michael Jackson became superstars by treating
the music video as an art form. Jackson’s videos often
were short films with elaborate staging and special effects
set to music. Technological advances became prevalent in
the music of the 1980s with the advent of the synthesizer,
an electronic piano that produced computerized sounds.
Some performers replaced ensembles of guitar, bass, and
drums with synthesizers, creating a futuristic and manufactured sound.
Paralleling the rise of the music video was the
emergence of rap or hip-hop. Developed in New York
City in the late 1970s and early 1980s, rap combined
rhymed lyrics with disco beats and turntable manipulations. One scholar noted that hip-hop ‘‘also encompassed break dancing, graffiti art, and new styles of
language and fashion.’’ Early rap groups like Public Enemy and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five instilled
social commentaries into their songs, using the popularity
of hip-hop to raise awareness about social conditions in
American cities.
The Growth of Mass Sports Sports became a major
product of both popular culture and the leisure industry.
The development of satellite television and various electronic breakthroughs helped make sports a global phenomenon. The Olympic Games could now be broadcast
around the globe from anywhere in the world. Sports
were a cheap form of entertainment since fans did not
have to leave their homes to enjoy athletic competitions.
In fact, some sports organizations initially resisted television, fearing that it would hurt ticket sales. Soon,
however, the tremendous revenues possible from television contracts overcame this hesitation. As sports television revenue escalated, many sports came to receive
the bulk of their yearly revenue from television contracts. The Olympics, for example, are now funded
primarily by American television. These contracts are
paid for by advertising sponsors, mostly for products to
be consumed while watching the sport: beer, soda, and
snack foods.
As sports assumed a prominent position in the social
life of the world, the pressures and rewards to not just
compete but win intensified. Fueled by advertising endorsements, the scientific study of sport led to aerodynamic helmets for cyclists, skintight bodysuits for skiers
and swimmers, and improved nutritional practices in all
sports. Such technological advances, however, also increased the manner in which athletes might break the
rules. From steroids to blood doping, some have used
medical supplements to illegally enhance their conditioning. Mandatory drug testing in the Olympics, Tour de
France, and World Cup attempts to level the playing field
and avoid repercussions such as occurred when reports of
steroid abuse prompted a governmental investigation of
Major League Baseball.

CONCLUSION
The late 1960s experienced a rash of protest as women actively
sought equality of rights with men and numerous groups of
students and radicals protested the war in Vietnam and unsatisfactory university conditions. The women’s movement gained
momentum in the 1970s and 1980s, but the student upheavals were
not a ‘‘turning point in the history of postwar Europe,’’ as some
people thought at the time. In the 1970s and 1980s, student rebels
would become middle-class professionals, and revolutionary
politics would remain mostly a memory.
In the 1970s, the Cold War took a new direction as the Soviet
Union and the United States moved, if fitfully, toward a lessening of
tensions, while the United States restored diplomatic ties with
China by the end of the 1970s. There were renewed tensions in the
Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union in the
early 1980s, but as we shall see in the next chapter, a dramatic shift
in Soviet leadership would soon bring an unexpected end to the
Cold War.
Between 1965 and 1985, the Western world remained divided
between a prosperous capitalistic West and a stagnant Eastern
Europe. The division seemed permanent at the time, but dramatic
changes in the Soviet Union would soon bring an end to the new
order created as a result of World War II.
