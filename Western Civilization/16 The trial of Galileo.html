<h2 id="org9f31927">16 The trial of Galileo</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9f31927">
<p class="verse">
In addition to political, economic, and social crises,<br />
&#xa0;the seventeenth century witnessed an intellectual one.<br />
The Scientific Revolution questioned and ultimately challenged conceptions and beliefs<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;about the nature of the external world and reality<br />
&#xa0;that had crystallized into a rather strict orthodoxy by the Later Middle Ages.<br />
Derived from the works of ancient Greeks and Romans and grounded in Christian thought,<br />
&#xa0;the medieval worldview had become almost overpowering.<br />
But the breakdown of Christian unity during the Reformation and the subsequent religious wars<br />
&#xa0;had created an environment<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;in which Europeans became more comfortable with<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;challenging both the ecclesiastical and political powers that be.<br />
Should it surprise us that a challenge to intellectual authority soon followed?<br />
<br />
The Scientific Revolution taught Europeans to view the universe and their place in it in a new way.<br />
The shift from an earthcentered to a sun-centered cosmos<br />
&#xa0;had an emotional as well as intellectual effect on those who understood it.<br />
Thus the Scientific Revolution, popularized in the eighteenth-century Enlightenment,<br />
&#xa0;stands as the major force in the transition to the largely secular, rational,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and materialistic perspective that has defined the modern Western mentality in modern times.<br />
<br />
The transition to a new worldview was far from easy, however.<br />
In the seventeenth century,<br />
&#xa0;the Italian scientist Galileo Galilei, an outspoken advocate of the new worldview,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;found his ideas strongly opposed by the authorities of the Roman Catholic Church.<br />
Galileo's position was clear:<br />
&#xa0;'I hold the sun to be situated motionless in the center of the revolution of the celestial bodies,<br />
&#xa0;while the earth rotates on its axis and revolves about the sun.'<br />
Moreover, 'nothing physical that sense-experience sets before our eyes<br />
&#xa0;ought to be called in question (much less condemned) upon the testimony of biblical passages.'<br />
But the church had a different view,<br />
&#xa0;and in 1633, Galileo, now sixty-eight and in ill health,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;was called before the dreaded Inquisition in Rome.<br />
He was kept waiting for two months before he was tried and found guilty of heresy and disobedience.<br />
Completely shattered by the experience, he denounced his errors:<br />
&#xa0;'With a sincere heart and unfeigned faith<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;I curse and detest the said errors and heresies contrary to the Holy Church.'<br />
Legend holds that when he left the trial rooms, Galileo muttered to himself:<br />
&#xa0;'And yet it does move!'<br />
In any case, Galileo had been silenced,<br />
&#xa0;but his writings remained, and they began to circulate through Europe.<br />
The actions of the Inquisition<br />
&#xa0;had failed to stop the spread of the new ideas of the Scientific Revolution.<br />
<br />
In one sense, the Scientific Revolution was not a revolution.<br />
It was not characterized by the explosive change and rapid overthrow of traditional authority<br />
&#xa0;that we normally associate with the word revolution.<br />
The Scientific Revolution did overturn centuries of authority,<br />
&#xa0;but only in a gradual and piecemeal fashion.<br />
Nevertheless, its results were truly revolutionary.<br />
The Scientific Revolution<br />
&#xa0;was a key factor in setting Western civilization on its modern secular and material path.<br />
