<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdd29bbf">
<p class="verse">
In the 1920s,<br />
&#xa0;many people in the West assumed that they were about to enter a new era of world peace,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;economic growth, and political democracy.<br />
In all of these areas, the optimistic hopes of the 1920s failed to be realized.<br />
After 1919, most people wanted peace but were unsure about how to maintain it.<br />
The League of Nations, conceived as a new instrument to provide for collective security,<br />
&#xa0;failed to work well.<br />
New treaties that renounced the use of war looked good on paper but had no means of enforcement.<br />
Virtually everyone favored disarmament, but few could agree on how to achieve it.<br />
<br />
Europe faced severe economic and social challenges after World War I.<br />
The European economy did not begin to recover from the war until 1922,<br />
&#xa0;and even then it was beset by financial problems left over from the war and,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;most devastating of all, the severe economic crisis that began at the end of 1929.<br />
The Great Depression brought untold misery to millions of people.<br />
Begging for food on the streets became widespread,<br />
&#xa0;especially when soup kitchens were unable to keep up with the demand.<br />
Larger and larger numbers of people were homeless<br />
&#xa0;and moved from place to place looking for work and shelter.<br />
In the United States,<br />
&#xa0;the homeless set up shantytowns<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;they named 'Hoovervilles' after the American president, Herbert Hoover.<br />
In their misery, some people saw but one solution, as one unemployed person expressed it:<br />
&#xa0;Today, when I am experiencing this for the first time,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;I think that I should prefer to do away with myself,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;to take gas, to jump into the river, or leap from some high place.<br />
&#xa0;Would I really come to such a decision? I do not know.<br />
&#xa0;Animals die, plants wither, but men always go on living.<br />
Social unrest spread rapidly,<br />
&#xa0;and some of the vast numbers of unemployed staged hunger marches to get attention.<br />
In democratic countries,<br />
&#xa0;more and more people began to listen to and vote for radical voices calling for extreme measures.<br />
<br />
According to U.S. President Woodrow Wilson,<br />
&#xa0;World War I had been fought to make the world safe for democracy,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and for a while after 1919, political democracy seemed well established.<br />
But hope soon faded<br />
&#xa0;as authoritarian regimes spread into Italy and Germany and across eastern Europe.<br />
