</p>

<p>
THE NEW EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION that had emerged in
the ninth and tenth centuries began to come into its own in the
eleventh and twelfth centuries as Europeans established new patterns
that reached their zenith in the thirteenth century. The High Middle
Ages (1000&#x2013;1300) was a period of recovery and growth for Western
civilization, characterized by a greater sense of security and a burst
of energy and enthusiasm. New agricultural practices that increased
the food supply helped spur a commercial and urban revival that,
accompanied by a rising population, gave a new dynamism to a
formerly static society.
</p>

<p>
Townspeople themselves were often great enthusiasts for their
new way of life. In the twelfth century, William Fitz-Stephen spoke
of London as one of the noble cities of the world: ‘‘It is happy in
the healthiness of its air, in the Christian religion, in the strength of
its defences, the nature of its site, the honor of its citizens, the modesty of its women; pleasant in sports; fruitful of noble men.’’ To
Fitz-Stephen, London offered myriad opportunities and pleasures.
Fairs and markets were held regularly, and ‘‘practically anything that
man may need is brought daily not only into special places but even
into the open squares.’’ Any man, according to Fitz-Stephen, ‘‘if he
is healthy and not a good-for-nothing, may earn his living expenses
and esteem according to his station.’’ Then, too, there are the happy
inhabitants of the city: Where else has one ‘‘ever met such a wonderful show of people this side or the other side of the sea’’? Sporting events and leisure activities are available in every season of the
year: ‘‘In Easter holidays they fight battles on water.’’ In summer,
‘‘the youths are exercised in leaping, dancing, shooting, wrestling,
casting the stone; the maidens dance as long as they can well see.’’
In winter, ‘‘when the great fen, or moor, which waters the walls of
the city on the north side, is frozen, many young men play upon
the ice; some, striding as wide as they may, do slide swiftly.’’1 To
Fitz-Stephen, ‘‘every convenience for human pleasure is known to
be at hand’’ in London. One would hardly know from his cheerful
description that medieval cities faced overcrowded conditions, terrible smells from rotting garbage and raw sewage, and the constant
challenge of epidemics and fires.
</p>

<p>
By the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, both the urban centers
and the urban population of Europe were experiencing a dramatic
expansion. New forms of cultural and intellectual expression also
arose in this new urban world. Although European society in the
High Middle Ages remained overwhelmingly agricultural, the
growth of trade and cities along with the development of a money
economy and new commercial practices and institutions constituted
a veritable commercial revolution that affected most of Europe.
</p>

<p>
Land and People in the High
Middle Ages
</p>

<p>
Q Focus Questions: What new agricultural practices arose
in the High Middle Ages? What roles did peasants and
aristocrats play in the civilization of the period?
</p>

<p>
In the Early Middle Ages, Europe was a sparsely populated
expanse dotted with villages of farmers and warriors and
covered with forests, which provided building and heating
materials and food in the form of game. The climate had
begun to improve around 700 after centuries of wetter and
colder conditions, but natural disasters remained a threat.
Drought or too much rain could mean bad harvests, famine, and dietary deficiencies that made people susceptible to
a wide range of diseases. Life expectancy remained low.
</p>

<p>
The High Middle Ages, from 1000 to 1300, witnessed
continued improvement in climate as a small rise in
temperature made for longer and better growing seasons.
At the same time, Europe experienced a dramatic increase in population, from 38.5 to 73.5 million people
(see Table 9.1). This was physically evident in the growth
of agricultural villages, towns, and cities and an increase
in land under cultivation.
</p>

<p>
What accounted for this dramatic rise in population?
For one thing, conditions in Europe were more settled
and peaceful after the invasions of the Early Middle Ages
had ended. Agricultural production also rose dramatically
after 1000. Were it not for this increase in food supplies,
the greater population could never have been sustained.
</p>

<p>
The New Agriculture
</p>

<p>
During the High Middle Ages, significant changes occurred
in the way Europeans farmed. In addition to the improved
growing conditions, another factor in increasing the output
of food was the increase in arable land, achieved chiefly by
clearingforested areas for cultivation (see the boxon p. 177).
Land-hungry peasants cut down trees and drained swamps.
By the thirteenth century, the total acreage used for farming
in Europe was greater than at any time before or since.
</p>

<p>
Technological Changes
</p>

<p>
Technological changes also furthered the development of agriculture. Many of these depended on the use of iron, whichwasmined in various areas
of Europe. Iron was in demand to make swords and armor
as well as scythes, axheads, and hoes for use on farms and
saws, hammers, and nails for building purposes. Iron was
crucial in making thecarruca,a heavy, wheeled plowstrong
enough to turn over the dense clay soil north of the Alps
and allow for drainage.
</p>

<p>
Because of the carruca’s weight, six or eight oxen were
needed to pull it, but oxen were slow. Two new inventions
for the horse made it possible to plow faster. A new horse
collar, which appeared in the tenth century, distributed
the weight around the shoulders and chest, rather than
along the throat, and could be used to hitch up a series
of horses, enabling them to pull the heavy new plow faster
and cultivate more land. And horseshoes, iron pads nailed
to the horses’ hooves, gave them better traction in the
rocky, clayey soil.
</p>

<p>
The use of the heavy, wheeled plow also led to cooperative agricultural villages. Because iron was expensive,
the plow had to be purchased by the entire community.
Similarly, an individual family could not afford a team of
animals, so villagers shared their beasts. Moreover, the
plow’s size and weight made it hard to maneuver, so land
was cultivated in long strips to minimize the amount of
turning that would have to be done.
</p>

<p>
People in the High Middle Ages learned to harness
the power of water and wind to do jobs formerly done by
human or animal muscle. Mills, located along streams
and powered by the rushing water, were used to grind
grain and produce flour. Dams were built to increase the
force of the water. The development of the cam enabled
millwrights to mechanize entire industries; waterpower
was used in certain phases of cloth production and to run
trip-hammers for the working of metals. The Chinese had
made use of the cam in operating trip-hammers for
hulling rice by the third century A.D. but had apparently
not extended its use to other industries.
</p>

<p>
Europeans also developed windmills to capture the
power of the wind. Historians are unsure if windmills
were imported into Europe (they were invented in Persia)
or designed independently by Europeans. In either case, by
the end of the twelfth century, these were beginning to
dot the European landscape. The watermill and windmill
were the most important inventions for the harnessing of
power until the steam engine in the eighteenth century,
and their spread had revolutionary consequences for
producing more food.
</p>

<p>
The Three-Field System
</p>

<p>
The shift from a two-field to a three-field system also
contributed to the increase in agricultural production. In
the Early Middle Ages, it was common to plant one field
while allowing another of equal size to lie fallow to regain
its fertility. Now estates were divided into three parts. One
field was planted in the fall with winter grains, such as rye
and wheat, while spring grains, such as oats and barley,
and vegetables, such as peas, beans, or lentils, were planted
in the second field. The third was allowed to lie fallow. By
rotating the fields, only one-third, rather than one-half, of
the land lay fallow at any time. The rotation of crops also
prevented the soil from being exhausted so quickly, and
more crops could now be grown.
</p>

<p>
By the thirteenth century, increasing demand for agricultural produce in the towns and cities led to higher
food prices. This encouraged lords to try to grow more
food for profit. One way to do this was to lease their demesne land to their serfs. Labor services were then transformed into money payments or fixed rents, thereby
converting many unfree serfs into free peasants. Although
many peasants still remained economically dependent on
their lords, they were no longer legally tied to the land.
Lords, in turn, became collectors of rents rather than operators of manors with both political and legal privileges.
The political and legal powers once exercised by lords were
increasingly reclaimed by the monarchical states.
</p>

<p>
Life of the Peasantry
</p>

<p>
Peasant activities were largely determined by the seasons
of the year. Each season brought a new round of tasks
appropriate for the time, although some periods were
considerably more hectic than others, especially harvest
time in August and September. A new cycle began in
October, when the peasants prepared the ground for
planting winter crops. In February and March, the land
was plowed for spring crops&#x2014;oats, barley, peas, beans,
and lentils. Early summer was a comparatively relaxed
time, although there was still weeding and sheepshearing
to be done. In every season, serfs worked not only their
own land but also the lord’s demesne. They also tended
the small gardens attached to their dwellings where they
grew the vegetables that made up much of their diet.
</p>

<p>
Religious feast days, Sunday Mass, baptisms, marriages, and funerals all brought peasants into contact with
the village church, a crucial part of manorial life. In the
village church, the peasant was baptized as an infant,
confirmed in his or her faith, sometimes married, and
given the sacrament of Holy Communion as well as the last
rites of the church before death. The village priest taught
the peasants the basic elements of Christianity so that they
would gain the Christian’s ultimate goal, salvation.
</p>

<p>
The lifestyle of the peasants was very simple. Their
cottages consisted of wood frames with walls made of
laths or sticks; the spaces between the laths were stuffed
with straw and rubble and then plastered over with clay.
Roofs were thatched. The houses of poorer peasants
consisted of a single room, but others had at least two
rooms&#x2014;a main room for cooking, eating, and other activities and another room for sleeping. There was little
privacy in a medieval peasant household.
</p>

<p>
Peasant women occupied both an important and a
difficult position in manorial society. They were expected to carry and bear their children and at the
same time fulfill their obligation to labor in the fields.
Their ability to manage the household might determine
whether a peasant family would starve or survive in
difficult times.
</p>

<p>
Though simple, a peasant’s daily diet was nutritious
when food was available. The basic staple of the peasant
diet, and the medieval diet in general,
was bread. After the women made
dough for the bread, the loaves were
baked in community ovens, which
were owned by the lord of the manor.
Peasant bread generally contained not
only wheat and rye but also barley,
millet, and oats, giving it a dark appearance and a heavy, hard texture.
Bread was supplemented by vegetables from the household gardens,
cheese from cow’s or goat’s milk,
nuts and berries from woodlands,
and fruits such as apples, pears, and
cherries. Chickens provided eggs and
sometimes meat.
</p>

<p>
Grains were important not only
for bread but also for making ale. In
northern Europe, ale was the most
common drink of the poor. If records
are accurate, enormous quantities of it
were consumed. A monastery in the
twelfth century records a daily allotment to the monks of three gallons a
day, far above the weekend consumption of many present-day college
students. Peasants in the field undoubtedly consumed even more. This high
consumption of alcohol might explain the large number
of accidental deaths recorded in medieval court records.
</p>

<p>
The Aristocracy of the High Middle Ages
</p>

<p>
In the High Middle Ages, European society was dominated by a group of men whose chief preoccupation was
warfare&#x2014;the lords and vassals of medieval society. The
lords were the kings, dukes, counts, barons, and viscounts
(and even bishops and archbishops) who held extensive
lands and considerable political power. They formed an
aristocracy or nobility that held real political, economic,
and social power. Nobles relied for military help on
knights, mounted warriors who fought for them in return
for weapons and daily sustenance. As warriors united by
the institution of knighthood, lords and knights came to
form a common group, albeit a group with social divisions based on extremes of wealth and landholdings.
</p>

<p>
Medieval theory maintained that the warlike qualities
of the nobility were justified by their role as defenders of
society, and the growth of the European nobility in the
High Middle Ages was made visible by an increasing
number of castles scattered across the landscape. Although
castle architecture varied considerably, castles did possess
two common features: they were permanent residences for
the noble family, its retainers, and servants, and they were
defensible fortifications. For defensive purposes, castles
were surrounded by open areas and large stone walls. At
the heart of the castle was the keep, a large, multistoried
building that housed kitchens, stables, and storerooms; a
great hall for visitors, dining, and administrative business;
and numerous rooms for sleeping and living. The growing
wealth of the High Middle Ages made it possible for the
European nobility to build more complex castles with
thicker walls and more elaborately decorated interiors. As
castles became more sturdily built, they proved to be more
easily defended and harder to seize by force.
</p>

<p>
The Way of the Warrior
</p>

<p>
At the age of seven or eight, the
sons of the nobility were sent either to a clerical school to
pursue a religious career or to another nobleman’s castle,
where they prepared for the life of a noble. Their chief
lessons were military; they learned how to joust, hunt,
ride, and handle weapons properly. After his apprenticeship in knighthood, at about the age of twenty-one, a
young man formally entered the adult world in a ceremony of ‘‘knighting.’’ A sponsor girded a sword on the
young candidate and struck him on the cheek or neck with
an open hand (or later touched him three times on the
shoulder with the blade of a sword), possibly signifying the
passing of the sponsor’s military valor to the new knight.
</p>

<p>
In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, under the influence of the church, an ideal of civilized behavior called
chivalry gradually evolved among the nobility. Chivalry
represented a code of ethics that knights were supposed to
uphold. In addition to defending the church and the defenseless, knights were expected to treat captives as honored
guests instead of putting them in dungeons. Chivalry also
implied that knights should fight only for glory, but this
account of a group of English knights by a medieval writer
reveals another motive for battle: ‘‘The whole city was
plundered to the last farthing, and then they proceeded to
rob all the churches throughout the city, . . . and seizing gold
and silver, cloth of all colors, gold rings, goblets, and precious
stones . . . they all returned to their own lords rich men.’’2
Apparently, not all chivalric ideals were taken seriously.
</p>

<p>
After his formal initiation into the world of warriors,
a young man returned home to find himself once again
subject to his parents’ authority. Young men were discouraged from marrying until their fathers died, at which
time they could marry and become lords of the castle.
Trained to be warriors but with no adult responsibilities,
young knights had little to do but fight. As the church
stepped up efforts to curb socially destructive fighting in
the twelfth century, tournaments began to be organized.
Initially, tournaments consisted of the melee, in which
warriors on horseback fought with blunted weapons in
free-for-all combat. By late in the century, the melee was
preceded by the joust, individual combat between two
knights. Gradually, the joust became the main part of the
tournament. Knights saw tournaments as an excellent way
to train for war. As one knight explained, ‘‘A knight
cannot distinguish himself in [war] if he has not trained
for it in tourneys. He must have seen his blood flow,
heard his teeth crack under fist blows, felt his opponent’s
weight bear down upon him as he lay on the ground and,
after being twenty times unhorsed, have risen twenty
times to fight.’’3
</p>

<p>
Aristocratic Women
</p>

<p>
Although women could legally hold
property, most women remained under the control of
men&#x2014;their fathers until they married (usually at the age of
fifteen or sixteen) and their husbands after they married.
Nevertheless, aristocratic women had numerous opportunities for playing important roles. Because the lord was
often away at war, on a Crusade (see Chapter 10), or at
court, the lady of the castle had to manage the estate, a
considerable responsibility in view of the fact that households, even of lesser aristocrats, could include large numbers of officials and servants. The lady of the castle was also
responsible on a regular basis for overseeing the food
supply and maintaining all other supplies for the smooth
operation of the household.
</p>

<p>
Although women were expected to be subservient to
their husbands (see the box above), there were many strong
women who advised and sometimes even dominated
their husbands. Perhaps the most famous was Eleanor of
Aquitaine (c. 1122&#x2013;1204), heiress to the duchy of Aquitaine in southwestern France. Married to King Louis VII of
France (1137&#x2013;1180), Eleanor accompanied her husband on
a Crusade, but her alleged affair with her uncle during the
Crusade led Louis to have their marriage annulled. Eleanor
then married Henry, duke of Normandy and count of
Anjou, who became King Henry II of England (1154&#x2013;
1189). She took an active role in politics, even assisting her
sons in rebelling against Henry in 1173 and 1174.
</p>

<p>
Blanche of Castile (1188&#x2013;1252) was another powerful
medieval queen. She became regent while her son Louis IX
was a boy and ruled France with a powerful hand during
much of the 1220s and 1230s. She repelled the attempt of
some rebellious French nobles to seize her son, the young
king, and defeated Henry III of England when he tried to
incite an uprising in France in an attempt to reconquer
Normandy. Blanche’s political sense was so astute that even
when Louis IX came of age, he continued to rely on her as
his chief adviser. One medieval chronicler gave her the
highest compliment he could think of: ‘‘She ruled as a man.’’

The New World of Trade
and Cities
</p>

<p>
Q Focus Questions: What developments contributed to
the revival of trade during the High Middle Ages, and
what areas were its primary beneficiaries? What were
the major features of medieval cities?
</p>

<p>
Medieval Europe was an overwhelmingly agrarian society, with most people living in small villages. In the
eleventh and twelfth centuries, however, new elements
were introduced that began to transform the economic
foundation of Western civilization: a
revival of trade, considerable expansion in the circulation of money, a
restoration of specialized craftspeople
and artisans, and the growth and
development of towns. These changes
were made possible by the new agricultural practices and subsequent increase in food production, which
freed some European families from
the need to produce their own food.
Merchants and artisans could now
buy their necessities.
</p>

<p>
The Revival of Trade
</p>

<p>
The revival of commercial activity was
a gradual process. During the chaotic
conditions of the Early Middle Ages, large-scale trade had
declined in western Europe except for Byzantine contacts
with Italy and the Jewish traders who moved back and
forth between the Muslim and Christian worlds. By the
end of the tenth century, however, people with both the
skills and the products for commercial activity were
emerging in Europe.
</p>

<p>
Cities in Italy assumed a leading role in the revival of
trade (see Map 9.1). By the end of the eighth century,
Venice, on the northeastern coast, had emerged as a town
with close trading ties to the Byzantine Empire. It developed a mercantile fleet and by the end of the tenth
century had become the chief western trading center for
Byzantine and Islamic commerce. Other coastal communities in western Italy, such as Genoa and Pisa, also
opened new trade routes.
</p>

<p>
In the High Middle Ages, Italian merchants became even more daring in their trade activities. They
established trading posts in Cairo, Damascus, and a
number of Black Sea ports, where they acquired goods
brought by Muslim merchants from India, China, and
Southeast Asia. A few Italian merchants even journeyed
to India and China in search of trade (see the box on
p. 183).
</p>

<p>
While the northern Italian cities were busy trading in
the Mediterranean, the towns of Flanders were doing
likewise in northern Europe. Flanders, the area along the
coast of present-day Belgium and northern France, was
known for the production of a much desired, highquality woolen cloth. The location of Flanders made it a
logical entrepoˆt for the traders of northern Europe.
Merchants from England, Scandinavia, France, and
Germany converged there to trade their wares for woolen
cloth. Flanders prospered in the eleventh and twelfth
centuries, and such Flemish towns as Bruges and Ghent
became centers for the trade and
manufacture of woolen cloth.
</p>

<p>
By the twelfth century, it was
almost inevitable that a regular
exchange of goods would develop
between Flanders and Italy. To
encourage this trade, the counts of
Champagne in northern France
devised a series of six fairs held
annually in the chief towns of
their territory. Northern merchants brought the furs, woolen
cloth, tin, hemp, and honey of
northern Europe to the fairs of
Champagne and exchanged them
for the cloth and swords of
northern Italy and the silks, sugar,
and spices of the East.
</p>

<p>
As trade increased, both gold and silver came to be in
demand at fairs and trading markets of all kinds. Slowly, a
money economy began to emerge. New trading companies as well as banking firms were set up to manage the
exchange and sale of goods. All of these new practices
were part of the rise of commercial capitalism, an economic system in which people invested in trade and
goods in order to make profits.
</p>

<p>
The Growth of Cities
</p>

<p>
The revival of trade led to a revival of cities. Merchants
needed places where they could live and build warehouses
to store their goods. Towns had greatly declined in the
Early Middle Ages, especially in Europe north of the Alps.
Old Roman cities continued to exist but had dwindled in
size and population. With the revival of trade, merchants
began to settle in these old cities, followed by craft workers
or artisans, people who had developed skills on manors or
elsewhere and now perceived the opportunity to ply their
trade producing objects that could be sold by the merchants. In the course of the eleventh and twelfth centuries,
the old Roman cities came alive with new residents.
</p>

<p>
Founding of New Cities and Towns
</p>

<p>
Beginning in the
late tenth century, many new cities and towns were founded,
particularly in northern Europe. Usually, a group of
merchants established a settlement near some fortified
stronghold, such as a castle or monastery. The original
meaning of the English borough or burgh and the German
Burg as a fortress or walled enclosure is still evident in the
names of many cities, such as Edinburgh and Hamburg.
Castles were particularly favored because they were usually located along major routes of transportation or at the
intersection of two important trade routes; the lords of
the castle also offered protection. As the settlement
prospered and expanded outward, new walls were built to
protect it.
</p>

<p>
Most towns were closely tied to their surrounding
territories because they were dependent on the countryside for their food supplies. In addition, they were often
part of the territory belonging to a lord and were subject
to his jurisdiction. Although lords wanted to treat towns
and townspeople as they would their vassals and serfs,
cities had totally different needs and a different perspective. Townspeople needed mobility to trade. Consequently,
the merchants and artisans of these boroughs and burghs,
who came to be called burghers or bourgeois, constituted
a revolutionary group who needed their own unique laws
to meet their requirements. Since the townspeople were
profiting from the growth of trade and sale of their
products, they were willing to pay for the right to make
their own laws and govern themselves. In many instances,
lords and kings saw the potential for vast new sources
of revenues and were willing to grant (or sell) to the
townspeople the liberties they were beginning to demand.
</p>

<p>
By 1100, burghers were obtaining charters of liberties
from their territorial lords that granted them the privileges
they wanted, including the right to bequeath goods and sell
property, freedom from any military obligation to the lord,
written urban law that guaranteed them their freedom, and
the right to become a free person after residing a year and a
day in the town. The last provision made it possible for a
runaway serf who could avoid capture to become a free
person in a city. Almost all new urban communities gained
these elementary liberties, but only some towns obtained
the right to govern themselves by choosing their own
officials and administering their own courts of law.
</p>

<p>
City Governments
</p>

<p>
Over time, medieval cities developed their own governments for running the affairs of the
community. Citizens (males who had been born in the
city or who had lived there for some time) elected
members of a city council that ran the affairs of the city
and also served as judges and magistrates. The electoral
process was carefully engineered to ensure that only
members of the wealthiest and most powerful families,
who came to be called the patricians, were elected.
City governments kept close watch over the activities
of their community. To care for the welfare of the community, a government might regulate air and water pollution; provide water barrels and delegate responsibility
to people in every section of the town to fight fires, which
were an ever-present danger; construct warehouses to
stockpile grain in the event of food emergencies; and set
the standards of weights and measures used in the various
local industries. Urban crime was not a major problem in
the towns of the High Middle Ages because the relatively
small size of communities made it difficult for criminals
to operate openly. Nevertheless, medieval urban governments did organize town guards to patrol the streets by
night and the city walls by day. People caught committing
criminal acts were quickly tried for their offenses. Serious
offenses, such as murder, were punished by execution,
usually by hanging. Lesser crimes were punished by fines,
flogging, or branding.
</p>

<p>
Medieval cities remained relatively small in comparison to either ancient or modern cities. A large trading
city would number about 5,000 inhabitants. By 1300,
London was the largest city in England, with almost
40,000 people. On the Continent north of the Alps, only a
few great urban centers of commerce, such as Bruges and
Ghent, had a population close to that. Italian cities tended
to be larger, with Venice, Florence, Genoa, Milan, and
Naples numbering almost 100,000 inhabitants each. Even
the largest European city, however, seemed insignificant
alongside the Byzantine capital of Constantinople or the
Arab cities of Damascus, Baghdad, and Cairo. For a long
time to come, Europe remained predominantly rural, but
in the long run, the rise of towns and the growth of trade
laid the foundations for the eventual transformation of
Europe from a rural agricultural society to an urban industrial one.
</p>

<p>
Life in the Medieval City
</p>

<p>
Medieval towns were surrounded by stone walls that were
expensive to build, so the space within was precious and
tightly filled. This gave medieval cities their characteristic
appearance of narrow, winding streets with houses
crowded against each other and the second and third
stories of the dwellings built out over the streets. Because
dwellings were constructed mostly of wood before the
fourteenth century and candles and wood fires were used
for light and heat, the danger of fire was great. Medieval
cities burned rapidly once a fire started.
</p>

<p>
Most of the people who lived in cities were merchants involved in trade and artisans engaged in
manufacturing of some kind. Generally, merchants and
artisans had their own sections within a city. The merchant area included warehouses, inns, and taverns. Artisan sections were usually divided along craft lines; each
craft had its own street where its activity was pursued.
</p>

<p>
The physical environment of many medieval cities
was not pleasant. They were often dirty and rife with
smells from animal and human waste deposited in backyard privies or on the streets. Air pollution was also a fact
of life, not only from the ubiquitous wood fires but also
from the use of a cheaper fuel, coal, employed industrially
by lime burners, brewers, and dyers, as well as by poor
people who could not afford to purchase wood. Cities
were also unable to stop water pollution, especially from
the tanning and animal-slaughtering industries. Butchers
dumped blood and waste products from their animals
into the river, while tanners threw in tannic acids, dried
blood, fat, hair, and wastes.
</p>

<p>
Because of the pollution, cities were not inclined to
use the rivers for drinking water but relied instead on
wells. Some communities repaired the system of aqueducts
left over from Roman times, and some even constructed
new ones. Private and public baths also existed in medieval towns. Paris, for example, had thirty-two public baths
for men and women. City laws did not allow lepers and
people with ‘‘bad reputations’’ to use them, but such
measures did not prevent the public baths from being
known for permissiveness. One contemporary commented
on what occurred in public bathhouses: ‘‘Shameful things.
Men make a point of staying all night in the public baths
and women at the break of day come in and through
‘ignorance’ find themselves in the men’s rooms.’’4 Authorities came under increasing pressure to close the baths
down, and the great plague of the fourteenth century
sealed their fate.
</p>

<p>
There were considerably more men than women in
medieval cities. Women, in addition to supervising the
household, purchasing food and preparing meals, raising
the children, and managing the family finances, were also
often expected to help their husbands in their trades. Some
women also developed their own trades, such as brewing
ale or making glass, to earn extra money. Sometimes when
master craftsmen died, their widows carried on their
trades. Some women in medieval towns were thus able to
lead lives of considerable independence.
</p>

<p>
Industry in Medieval Cities
</p>

<p>
The revival of trade enabled cities and towns to become
important centers for manufacturing a wide range of
products, such as cloth, metalwork, shoes, and leather
goods. A host of crafts were carried on in houses along
the narrow streets of the medieval cities. From the twelfth
century on, artisans began to organize themselves into
guilds, which came to play a leading role in the economic
life of the cities.
</p>

<p>
By the thirteenth century, virtually every group of
craft workers, including tanners, carpenters, and bakers,
had its own guild, and specialized groups of merchants,
such as dealers in silk, spices, wool, or banking, had guilds
as well. Craft guilds directed almost every aspect of the
production process. They set standards for the articles
produced, specified the methods of production to be
used, and fixed the price at which the finished goods
could be sold. Guilds also determined the number of men
who could enter a specific trade and the procedure they
must follow to do so.
</p>

<p>
A person who wanted to learn a trade first became an
apprentice to a master craftsman, usually at around the
age of ten. After five to seven years of service, in which
they learned their craft, apprentices became journeymen
(or journeywomen, although most were male), who then
worked for wages for other masters. Journeymen aspired
to become masters as well. To do so, they were expected
to produce a ‘‘masterpiece,’’ a finished piece in their craft
that allowed the master craftsmen of the guild to judge
whether the journeymen were qualified to become masters and join the guild.
</p>

<p>
The Intellectual and Artistic
World of the High Middle Ages
</p>

<p>
Q Focus Question: What were the major intellectual and
cultural achievements of European civilization in the
High Middle Ages?
</p>

<p>
The High Middle Ages was a time of tremendous intellectual and artistic vitality. The period witnessed the
growth of educational institutions, a rebirth of interest in
ancient culture, a quickening of theological thought, the
development of a vernacular literature, and a burst of activity in architecture. While monks continued to play an
important role in intellectual activity, the secular clergy,
cities, and courts, whether of kings, princes, or high church
officials, began to exert a newfound influence. Especially
significant were the new cultural expressions that emerged
in towns and cities.
</p>

<p>
The Rise of Universities
</p>

<p>
The university as we know it&#x2014;with faculty, students, and
degrees&#x2014;was a product of the High Middle Ages. The
word university is derived from the Latin word universitas,
meaning a corporation or guild, and referred to either a
guild of teachers or a guild of students. Medieval universities were educational guilds or corporations that produced educated and trained individuals.
</p>

<p>
The Origins of Universities
</p>

<p>
The first European university was founded in Bologna, Italy, and coincided with
the revival of interest in Roman law, especially the rediscovery of Justinian’s Body of Civil Law. In the twelfth
century, Irnerius (1088&#x2013;1125), a great teacher of Roman
law in Bologna, attracted students from all over Europe.
Most of them were laymen, usually older individuals who
served as administrators to kings and princes and were
eager to learn more about law so they could apply it in
their jobs. To protect themselves, students at Bologna
formed a guild or universitas, which was recognized by
Emperor Frederick Barbarossa and given a charter in 1158.
Although the faculty also organized itself as a group, the
universitas of students at Bologna was far more influential.
It obtained a promise of freedom for students from local
authorities, regulated the price of books and lodging, and
determined the curriculum, fees, and standards for their
masters. Teachers were fined if they missed a class or began
their lectures late.
</p>

<p>
In northern Europe, the University of Paris became
the first recognized university. A number of teachers or
masters who had received licenses to teach from the cathedral school of Notre-Dame in Paris began to take on
extra students for a fee. By the end of the twelfth century,
these masters teaching at Paris had formed a universitas
or guild of masters. By 1200, the king of France, Philip
Augustus, officially acknowledged the existence of the
University of Paris. The University of Oxford in England,
organized on the Paris model, appeared in 1208. A migration of scholars from Oxford led to the establishment
of Cambridge University the following year. In the Late
Middle Ages, kings, popes, and princes vied to found new
universities. By the end of the Middle Ages, there were
eighty universities in Europe, most of them located in
England, France, Italy, and Germany (see Map 9.2).
</p>

<p>
Teachers and Students in the Medieval University
</p>

<p>
A
student’s initial studies at a medieval university centered
around the traditional liberal arts curriculum, which
consisted of grammar, rhetoric, logic, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music. All classes were conducted in
Latin, which provided a common means of communication for students, regardless of their country of origin.
Basically, medieval university instruction was done by the
lecture method. The word lecture is derived from the Latin
verb meaning ‘‘to read.’’ Before the development of the
printing press in the fifteenth century, books were expensive, and few students could afford them, so masters read
from a text (such as a collection of laws if the subject was
law) and then added their commentaries. No exams were
given after a series of lectures, but when a student applied
for a degree, he (women did not attend universities in the
Middle Ages) was given a comprehensive oral examination
by a committee of teachers. These exams were taken after a
four- or six-year period of study. The first degree a student
could earn was the artium baccalaureus, or bachelor of arts;
later he might receive an artium magister, or master of arts.
All degrees were technically licenses to teach, although
most students receiving them did not become teachers.
</p>

<p>
After completing the liberal arts curriculum, a student
could go on to study law, medicine, or theology, which
was the most highly regarded subject of the medieval
curriculum. The study of law, medicine, or theology could
take a decade or more. A student who passed his final oral
examinations was granted a doctoral degree, which officially allowed him to teach his subject. Students who received degrees from medieval universities could pursue
other careers besides teaching that proved to be much
more lucrative. A law degree was deemed essential for
those who wished to serve as advisers to kings and princes.
The growing administrative bureaucracies of popes and
kings also demanded a supply of clerks with a university
education who could keep records and draw up official
documents. Medieval universities provided the teachers,
administrators, lawyers, and doctors for medieval society.
</p>

<p>
Medieval universities shared in the violent atmosphere of the age. Records from courts of law reveal numerous instances of disturbances in European universities.
One German professor was finally dismissed for stabbing
one too many of his colleagues in faculty meetings.
A student in Bologna was attacked in the classroom by
another student armed with a sword. Oxford regulations
attempted to dampen the violence by forbidding students
to bring weapons to class. Not uncommonly, town-andgown struggles (‘‘gown’’ refers to the academic robe worn
by teachers and students) escalated into bloody riots between townspeople and students (see the box on p. 188).
</p>

<p>
A Revival of Classical Antiquity
</p>

<p>
Another aspect of the intellectual revival of the High Middle
Ages was a resurgence of interest in the works of Classical
antiquity&#x2014;the works of the Greeks and Romans. In the
twelfth century, western Europe was introduced to a large
number of Greek scientific and philosophical works, including those of Galen and Hippocrates on medicine, Ptolemy on
astronomy, and Euclid on mathematics. Above all, the West
now had availablethe complete works ofAristotle.During the
second half of the twelfth century, all of Aristotle’s scientific
works were translated into Latin. This great influx of Aristotle’s works had an overwhelming impact on the West. He
cameto be viewed asthe ‘‘masterofthosewho know,’’the man
who seemed to have understood every field of knowledge.
</p>

<p>
The recovery of Greek scientific and philosophical works was not a simple process,
however. Little knowledge of Greek had survived in Europe. It was through the Muslim
world, especially in Spain, that the West recovered the works of Aristotle and other
Greeks. The translation of Greek works into
Arabic was one aspect of the brilliant Muslim
civilization; in the twelfth century, these writings were translated from Arabic into Latin,
making them available to the West.
</p>

<p>
The Islamic world had more to contribute
intellectually to the West than translations,
however. Scientific work in the ninth and tenth
centuries had enabled it to forge far ahead of the
Western world, and in the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries, Arabic works on physics, mathematics, medicine, and optics became available to the
West in Latin translations. Adelard of Bath
(1090&#x2013;1150) was one source of these works.
Having traveled throughout the Mediterranean
world, he later translated an Arabic version of
Euclid’s Elements (see Chapter 4) into Latin, as
well as the mathematical works of al-Khwarizmi
(see Chapter 8). Adelard also introduced to Europeans the
astrolabe, an Arabic astronomical instrument of great
value to sailors.
</p>

<p>
When Aristotle’s works were brought into the West in
the second half of the twelfth century, they were accompanied by commentaries written by outstanding Arabic
and Jewish philosophers. One example was Ibn-Rushd,
also known as Averroe¨s (1126&#x2013;1198), who lived in Co´rdoba and composed a systematic commentary on virtually all of Aristotle’s surviving works.
</p>

<p>
The Revival of Roman Law
</p>

<p>
Another aspect of the revival of Classical antiquity was the
rediscovery of the great work of Justinian, the Body of Civil
Law, known to the medieval West before 1100 only at
second hand. Initially, teachers of law, such as Irnerius of
Bologna, were content merely to explain the meaning of
Roman legal terms to their students. Gradually, they became more sophisticated so that by the mid-twelfth century, ‘‘doctors of law’’ had developed commentaries and
systematic treatises on the legal texts. Italian cities, especially
Pavia and Bologna, became prominent centers for the study
of Roman law. By the thirteenth century, Italian jurists were
systematizing the various professional commentaries on
Roman law into a single commentary known as the ordinary gloss. Study of Roman law at the universities came to
consist of learning the text of the law along with this gloss.
</p>

<p>
The training of students in Roman law at medieval
universities led to further application of its principles as
these students became judges, lawyers, scribes, and councillors for the towns and monarchies of western Europe.
By the beginning of the thirteenth century, the old system
of the ordeal was being replaced by a rational decisionmaking process based on the systematic collection and
analysis of evidence, a clear indication of the impact of
Roman law on the European legal system.
</p>

<p>
The Development of Scholasticism
</p>

<p>
The importance of Christianity in medieval society probably made it certain that theology would play a central role
in the European intellectual world. Theology, the formal
study of religion, was ‘‘queen of the sciences’’ in the new
universities. Beginning in the eleventh century, the effort
to apply reason or logical analysis to the church’s basic
doctrines had a significant impact on the study of theology. The word scholasticism is used to refer to the philosophical and theological system of the medieval schools.
A primary preoccupation of scholasticism was the attempt
to reconcile faith and reason&#x2014;to demonstrate that what
was accepted on faith was in harmony with what could be
learned by reason.
</p>

<p>
Scholasticism had its beginnings in the theological
world of the eleventh and twelfth centuries but reached its
high point in the thirteenth. The overriding task of
scholasticism in the thirteenth century was to harmonize
Christian revelation with the work of Aristotle. The great
influx of Aristotle’s works into the West in the High
Middle Ages threw many theologians into consternation.
Aristotle was so highly regarded that he was called simply
‘‘the Philosopher,’’ yet he had arrived at his conclusions by
rational thought&#x2014;not revelation&#x2014;and some of his doctrines, such as the mortality of the individual soul, contradicted the teachings of the church. The most famous
attempt to reconcile Aristotle and the doctrines of
Christianity was that of Saint Thomas Aquinas.
</p>

<p>
Thomas Aquinas (1225&#x2013;1274) studied theology at
Cologne and Paris and taught at both Naples and Paris, and
it was at the latter that he finished his famous Summa Theologica (Summa of Theology&#x2014;a summa was a compendium
that attempted to bring together all existing knowledge on a
given subject). Aquinas’ masterpiece was organized according to the dialectical method of the scholastics. Aquinas first
posed a question, cited sources that offered opposing
opinions on the question, and then resolved them by arriving at his own conclusions. In this fashion, Aquinas raised
and discussed some six hundred articles or issues.
</p>

<p>
Aquinas’ reputation derives from his masterful attempt to reconcile faith and reason. He took it for granted
that there were truths derived by reason and truths derived by faith. He was certain, however, that the two
truths could not be in conflict:
</p>

<p>
The light of faith that is freely infused into us does not destroy
the light of natural knowledge [reason] implanted in us naturally. For although the natural light of the human mind is insufficient to show us these things made manifest by faith, it is
nevertheless impossible that these things which the divine principle gives us by faith are contrary to these implanted in us
by nature [reason]. Indeed, were that the case, one or the
other would have to be false, and, since both are given to us
by God, God would have to be the author of untruth, which is
impossible. . . . It is impossible that those things which are of
philosophy can be contrary to those things which are of faith.5
</p>

<p>
The natural mind, unaided by faith, could arrive at
truths concerning the physical universe. Without the help
of God’s grace, however, reason alone could not grasp
spiritual truths, such as the Trinity (the belief that God,
Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are three manifestations of the
same unique deity) or the Incarnation (the belief that
Jesus in his lifetime was God in human form).
</p>

<p>
Literature in the High Middle Ages
</p>

<p>
Latin was the universal language of medieval European
civilization. Used in the church and schools, it enabled
learned people to communicate anywhere on the Continent. But in the twelfth century, much new literature was
being written in the vernacular (the local language, such
as Spanish, French, English, or German). A new market
for vernacular literature appeared in the twelfth century
when educated laypeople at court and in the new urban
society sought fresh avenues of entertainment.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the most popular vernacular literature of the
twelfth century was troubadour poetry, which was chiefly
the product of nobles and knights. This poetry focused on
the love of a knight for a lady, generally a married noble
lady, who inspires him to become a braver knight and a
better poet. A good example is found in the laments of
the crusading noble Jaufre´ Rudel, who cherished a dream
lady from afar whom he said he would always love but
feared he would never meet:
</p>

<p>
Most sad, most joyous shall I go away,
Let me have seen her for a single day,
My love afar,
I shall not see her, for her land and mine
Are sundered, and the ways are hard to find,
So many ways, and I shall lose my way,
So wills it God.
</p>

<p>
First appearing in southern France, troubadour poetry
soon spread to northern France, Italy, and Germany.
</p>

<p>
Another type of vernacular literature was the chanson
de geste, or heroic epic. The earliest and finest example is
The Song of Roland, which appeared around 1100 and was
written in a dialect of French, a language derived from
Latin. The chansons de geste were written for a maledominated society. The chief events described in these poems are battles and political contests. Their world is one of
combat in which knights fight courageously for their kings
and lords. Women play little or no role in this literary genre.
</p>

<p>
Romanesque Architecture: ‘‘A White Mantle
of Churches’’
</p>

<p>
The eleventh and twelfth centuries witnessed an explosion
of building, both private and public. The construction of
castles and churches absorbed most of the surplus resources of medieval society and at the same time reflected
its basic preoccupations, God and warfare. The churches
were by far the most conspicuous of the public buildings.
A chronicler of the eleventh century commented:
</p>

<p>
[After the] year of the millennium, which is now about three
years past, people all over the world, but especially in Italy and
France, began to rebuild their churches. Although most of
them were well built and in little need of alterations, Christian
nations were rivalling each other to have the most beautiful
edifices. One might say the world was shaking herself, throwing
off her old garments, and robing herself with a white mantle
of churches. Then nearly all the cathedrals, the monasteries
dedicated to different saints, and even the small village chapels
were reconstructed more beautifully by the faithful.7
</p>

<p>
Hundreds of new cathedrals, abbeys, and pilgrimage
churches, as well as thousands of parish churches in rural
villages, were built in the eleventh and twelfth centuries.
This building spree reflected a revived religious culture
and the increased wealth of the period produced by agriculture, trade, and the growth of cities.
</p>

<p>
The cathedrals of the eleventh and twelfth centuries
were built in the Romanesque style, a truly international
style. The construction of churches required the services
of a cadre of professional master builders whose employment throughout Europe guaranteed international
unity in basic features.
</p>

<p>
Romanesque churches were normally built in the basilica shape used in the construction of churches in the
Late Roman Empire. Basilicas were simply rectangular
buildings with flat wooden roofs. Elaborating on this basic
plan, Romanesque builders made a significant innovation
by replacing the flat wooden roof with a long, round stone
vault called a barrel vault or a cross vault where
two barrel vaults intersected (a vault is simply a
curved roof made of masonry). The barrel vault
was used when a transept was added to create a
church plan in the shape of a cross. Although
barrel and cross vaults were technically difficult
to construct, they were considered aesthetically
pleasing and technically proficient. They also
had fine acoustics.
</p>

<p>
Because stone roofs were extremely heavy,
Romanesque churches required massive pillars
and walls to hold them up. This left little space
for windows, making Romanesque churches
quite dark inside. The massive walls and pillars
gave Romanesque churches a sense of solidity
and a look reminiscent of a fortress.
</p>

<p>
The Gothic Cathedral

Begun in the twelfth century and brought to
perfection in the thirteenth, the Gothic cathedral
remains one of the great artistic triumphs of the
High Middle Ages. Soaring skyward, as if to reach
heaven, it was a fitting symbol for medieval
people’s preoccupation with God.
</p>

<p>
Two fundamental innovations of the twelfth century
made Gothic cathedrals possible. The combination of
ribbed vaults and pointed arches replaced the barrel vault
of Romanesque churches and enabled builders to make
Gothic churches higher than their Romanesque counterparts. The use of pointed arches and ribbed vaults created
an impression of upward movement, a sense of weightless
upward thrust that implied the energy of God. Another
technical innovation, the flying buttress, basically a heavy
arched pier of stone built onto the outside of the walls,
made it possible to distribute the weight of the church’s
vaulted ceilings outward and downward and thus reduce
the thickness of the heavy walls used in Romanesque
churches to hold the weight of the massive barrel vaults.
The thinner walls of Gothic cathedrals could consequently
be filled with magnificent stained-glass windows, which
created a play of light inside that varied with the sun at
different times of the day. The preoccupation with colored
light in Gothic cathedrals was inspired by the belief that
natural light was a symbol of the divine light of God.

<p>
The first fully Gothic church was the abbey church of
Saint-Denis near Paris, inspired by its famous Abbot
Suger and built between 1140 and 1150. A product of
northern France, the Gothic style had spread by the midthirteenth century to England, Spain, Germany, and virtually all the rest of Europe. The most brilliant Gothic
cathedrals were still to be found in France&#x2014;in Paris
(Notre-Dame), Reims, Amiens, and Chartres.
</p>

<p>
A Gothic cathedral was the work of an entire community. All classes of society contributed to its construction. Money was raised from wealthy townspeople,
who had profited from the new trade and industries, as
well as from kings and nobles. Master masons, who were
both architects and engineers, designed the cathedrals.
They drew up the plans and supervised the work of
construction. Stonemasons and other craftspeople were
paid a daily wage and provided the skilled labor to build
the cathedrals. A Gothic cathedral symbolized the chief
preoccupation of a medieval Christian community, its
dedication to a spiritual ideal. As we have observed before, the largest buildings of an era reflect the values of its
society. The Gothic cathedral, with its towers soaring
toward heaven, gave witness to an age when a spiritual
impulse still underlay most of existence.

CONCLUSION
</p>

<p>
The new European civilization that had emerged in the Early
Middle Ages began to flourish in the High Middle Ages. Better
growing conditions, an expansion of cultivated land, and technological and agricultural changes combined to enable Europe’s food
supply to increase significantly after 1000. This increase helped
sustain a dramatic rise in population that was apparent in the
expansion of towns and cities.
</p>

<p>
The High Middle Ages witnessed economic and social changes
that some historians believe set European civilization on a path that
lasted until the Industrial Revolution of the late eighteenth century
created a new pattern. The revival of trade, the expansion of towns
and cities, and the development of a money economy did not mean
the end of a predominantly rural European society, but they did
open the door to new ways to make a living and new opportunities
for people to expand and enrich their lives. Eventually, they laid the
foundations for the development of a mostly urban industrial
society.
</p>

<p>
The High Middle Ages also gave birth to a cultural revival that
led to a rediscovery of important aspects of the Classical heritage, to
new centers of learning in the universities, to the use of reason
to systematize the study of theology, to the development of a
vernacular literature that appealed to both knights and townspeople, and to a dramatic increase in the number and size of
churches.
