<h2 id="org2c865ff">17 The Parisian salon of Madame Geoffrin</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2c865ff">
<p class="verse">
The earth-shattering work of the natural philosophers in the Scientific Revolution<br />
&#xa0;had affected only a relatively small number of Europe's educated elite.<br />
In the eighteenth century, this changed dramatically<br />
&#xa0;as a group of intellectuals known as the philosophes<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;popularized the ideas of the Scientific Revolution<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and used them to undertake a dramatic examination of all aspects of life.<br />
In Paris, the cultural capital of Europe,<br />
&#xa0;women took the lead<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;in bringing together groups of men and women to discuss the new ideas of the philosophes.<br />
At her fashionable home in the Rue SaintHonore,<br />
&#xa0;Marie-Therese de Geoffrin, the wife of a wealthy merchant,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;held sway over gatherings that became the talk of France and even Europe.<br />
Distinguished foreigners, including a future king of Sweden and a future king of Poland,<br />
&#xa0;competed to receive invitations.<br />
When Madame Geoffrin made a visit to Vienna, she was so well received that she exclaimed,<br />
&#xa0;'I am better known here than a couple of yards from my own house!'<br />
Madame Geoffrin was an amiable but firm hostess<br />
&#xa0;who allowed wide-ranging discussions as long as they remained in good taste.<br />
When she found that artists and philosophers did not mix particularly well<br />
&#xa0;(the artists were high-strung and the philosophers talked too much),<br />
&#xa0;she set up separate meetings: artists were invited on Mondays, philosophers on Wednesdays.<br />
These gatherings were but one of many avenues for the spread of the ideas of the philosophes.<br />
And those ideas had such a widespread impact on their society<br />
&#xa0;that historians ever since have called the eighteenth century the Age of Enlightenment.<br />
<br />
For most of the philosophes, enlightenment included the rejection of traditional Christianity.<br />
The religious wars and intolerance of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries<br />
&#xa0;had left intellectuals so disgusted with religious fanaticism<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that they were open to the new ideas of the Scientific Revolution.<br />
Whereas the great scientists of the seventeenth century believed that their work exalted God,<br />
&#xa0;the intellectuals of the eighteenth century read the same conclusions a different way<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and increasingly turned their backs on Christian orthodoxy.<br />
Consequently, European intellectual life in the eighteenth century<br />
&#xa0;was marked by the emergence of the secularization<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that has characterized the modern Western mentality ever since.<br />
Ironically,<br />
&#xa0;at the same time that reason and materialism were beginning to replace faith and worship,<br />
&#xa0;a great outburst of religious sensibility manifested itself in music and art.<br />
Clearly, the growing secularization of the eighteenth century<br />
&#xa0;had not yet captured the hearts and minds of all Europeans.<br />
