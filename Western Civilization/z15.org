Hyacinth Rigaud’s portrait of Louis XIV captures the king’s
sense of royal grandeur

BY THE END of the sixteenth century, Europe was beginning to
experience some decline in religious passions and a growing secularization that affected both the political and intellectual worlds (the
intellectual effect will be discussed in Chapter 16). Some historians
like to speak of the seventeenth century as a turning point in the
evolution of the modern state system in Europe. The ideal of a
united Christian Europe gave way to the practical realities of a system of secular entities in which matters of state took precedence
over the salvation of subjects’ souls. By the seventeenth century, the
credibility of Christianity had been so weakened through religious
wars that more and more Europeans came to think of politics in
strictly secular terms.

One of the responses to the religious wars and other crises of
the time was a yearning for order. As the internal social and political
rebellions and revolts died down, it became apparent that the privileged classes of society---the aristocrats---remained in control, although important differences in political forms existed in the various
states. In many places, the extension of monarchical power was
viewed as a stabilizing force. This development, which historians
have called absolutism or absolute monarchy, was most evident in
France during the flamboyant reign of Louis XIV, widely regarded as
the perfect embodiment of an absolute monarch. In his memoirs,
the duc de Saint-Simon, who had firsthand experience of French
court life, said that Louis was ‘‘the very figure of a hero, so imbued
with a natural but most imposing majesty that it appeared even in
his most insignificant gestures and movements.’’ The king’s natural
grace gave him a special charm as well: ‘‘He was as dignified and
majestic in his dressing gown as when dressed in robes of state,
or on horseback at the head of his troops.’’ His life was orderly:
‘‘Nothing could be regulated with greater exactitude than were his
days and hours.’’ His self-control was impeccable: ‘‘He did not lose
control of himself ten times in his whole life, and then only with
inferior persons.’’ But even absolute monarchs had imperfections,
and Saint-Simon had the courage to point them out: ‘‘Louis XIV’s
vanity was without limit or restraint,’’ which led to his ‘‘distaste for
all merit, intelligence, education, and, most of all, for all independence of character and sentiment in others,’’ as well as his ‘‘mistakes
of judgment in matters of importance.’’

But absolutism was not the only response to the search for
order in the seventeenth century. Other states, such as England,
reacted differently to domestic crisis, and another very different
system emerged where monarchs were limited by the power of their
representative assemblies. Absolute and limited monarchy were the
two poles of seventeenth-century state building.

Social Crises, War, and Rebellions
Q Focus Question: What economic, social, and political
crises did Europe experience in the first half of the
seventeenth century?
The inflation-fueled prosperity of the sixteenth century
showed signs of slackening in the seventeenth. Economic
contraction was evident in some parts of Europe by the
1620s. In the 1630s and 1640s, as imports of silver from
the Americas declined, economic recession intensified,
especially in the Mediterranean area. Italy, the industrial
and financial center of Europe in the Renaissance, was
becoming an economic backwater. Spain’s economy was
also seriously failing by the 1640s.
Population trends of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries also testify to Europe’s worsening conditions.
The sixteenth century was a period of expanding population, possibly related to a warmer climate and increased
food supplies. It has been estimated that the population
of Europe increased from 60 million in 1500 to 85 million
by 1600, the first major recovery since the devastation of
the Black Death in the mid-fourteenth century. However,
records also indicate a leveling off of the population by
1620 and even a decline by 1650, especially in central and
southern parts of the Continent. Europe’s longtime
adversaries---war, famine, and plague---continued to affect
population levels, and another ‘‘little ice age’’ midway
through the sixteenth century, when average temperatures
fell, affected harvests and gave rise to famines. These
problems created social tensions that came to a boil in the
witchcraft hysteria.
The Witchcraft Hysteria
The frenzy over witchcraft affected the lives of many Europeans in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Witchcraft trials were held in England, Scotland, Switzerland,
Germany, some parts of France and the Low Countries, and
even New England in America.
Witchcraft was not a new phenomenon. Its practice
had been part of traditional village culture for centuries, but it came to be viewed as both sinister and
dangerous when the medieval church began to connect
witches to the activities of the devil, thereby transforming witchcraft into a heresy that had to be extirpated. After the creation of the Inquisition in the
thirteenth century, people were accused of a variety of
witchcraft practices and, following the biblical injunction ‘‘Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live,’’ were turned
over to secular authorities for burning at the stake or, in
England, hanging.
The Spread of Witchcraft What distinguished witchcraft in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries from these
previous developments was the increased number of trials
and executions of presumed witches. Perhaps more than a
hundred thousand people were prosecuted throughout
Europe on charges of witchcraft. Although larger cities
were affected first, the trials spread to smaller towns and
rural areas as the hysteria persisted well into the seventeenth century (see the box on p. 317).
The accused witches usually confessed to a number of
practices, most often after intense torture. Many said that
they had sworn allegiance to the devil and attended sabbats, nocturnal gatherings at which they feasted, danced,
and even copulated with the devil in sexual orgies. More
common, however, were admissions of using evil incantations and special ointments and powders to wreak
havoc on neighbors by killing their livestock, injuring their
children, or raising storms to destroy their crops.
A number of contributing factors have been suggested to explain why the witchcraft frenzy became so
widespread in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
Religious uncertainties clearly played some part. Many
witchcraft trials occurred in areas where Protestantism
had been recently victorious or in regions, such as
southwestern Germany, where controversies between
Protestants and Catholics still raged. As religious passions
became inflamed, accusations of being in league with the
devil became common on both sides. Recently, however,
historians have emphasized the importance of social
conditions, especially the problems of a society in turmoil,
in explaining the witchcraft hysteria. At a time when the
old communal values that stressed working together for
the good of the community were disintegrating, property
owners became more fearful of the growing numbers of
poor among them and transformed them psychologically
into agents of the devil. Old women were particularly
susceptible to suspicion. When problems arose---and there
were many in this crisis-laden period---these people were
the most likely scapegoats.
That women should be the chief victims of witchcraft
trials was hardly accidental. Nicholas Re´my, a witchcraft
judge in France in the 1590s, found it ‘‘not unreasonable
that this scum of humanity, i.e., witches, should be drawn
chiefly from the feminine sex.’’1 To another judge, it came
as no surprise that witches would confess to sexual experiences with Satan: ‘‘The Devil uses them so, because he
knows that women love carnal pleasures, and he means to
bind them to his allegiance by such agreeable provocations.’’2 Of course, not only witch hunters held such low
estimates of women. Most theologians, lawyers, and
philosophers in early modern Europe maintained a belief
in the natural inferiority of women, making it seem
plausible that women would be more susceptible to
witchcraft.
Decline By the mid-seventeenth century, the witchcraft
hysteria began to subside. The destruction of the religious
wars had at least forced people to accept a grudging
toleration, tempering religious passions. Moreover, as
governments began to stabilize after the period of crisis,
fewer magistrates were willing to accept the unsettling
and divisive conditions generated by the trials of witches.
Finally, by the turn of the eighteenth century, more and
more people were questioning their old attitudes toward
religion and found it contrary to reason to believe in a
world haunted by evil spirits.
The Thirty Years’ War
Although many Europeans responded to the upheavals of
the second half of the sixteenth century with a desire for
peace and order, the first fifty years of the seventeenth
century continued to be plagued by crises. A devastating
war that affected much of Europe and rebellions seemingly everywhere protracted an atmosphere of disorder
and violence.
Religion, especially the struggle between militant
Catholicism and militant Calvinism, played an important
role in the outbreak of the Thirty Years’ War (1618--
1648), often called the ‘‘last of the religious wars.’’ As the
war progressed, however, it became increasingly clear that
secular, dynastic-nationalist considerations were far more
important.
The Thirty Years’ War began in the Germanic lands
of the Holy Roman Empire as a struggle between Catholic
forces, led by the Habsburg Holy Roman Emperors, and
Protestant---primarily Calvinist---nobles in Bohemia who
rebelled against Habsburg authority. What began as a
struggle over religious issues soon became a wider conflict
determined by political motivations as both minor and
major European powers---Denmark, Sweden, France,
and Spain---made the war a Europe-wide struggle (see
Map 15.1). The struggle for European leadership between
the Bourbon dynasty of France and the Habsburg dynasties of Spain and the Holy Roman Empire was an
especially important factor. Nevertheless, most of the
battles were fought on German soil, with devastating
results for the German people.
The war in Germany was officially ended by the Peace
of Westphalia in 1648, which ensured that all German
states, including the Calvinist ones, were free to determine their own religion. The major contenders gained
new territories, and one of them, France, emerged as the
dominant nation in Europe. The more than three hundred states that made up the Holy Roman Empire were
recognized as virtually independent, each with the power
to conduct its own foreign policy. The Habsburg emperor
had been reduced to a figurehead. The Peace of Westphalia also made it clear that religion and politics were
now separate in the Holy Roman Empire. Political motives became the guiding forces in public affairs as religion moved closer to becoming primarily a matter of
personal conviction and individual choice.
The economic and social effects of the Thirty Years’
War on Germany are still debated. An older view pictured
a ruined German economy and a decline in German
population from 21 to 13 million between 1600 and 1650,
but more recent opinions have estimated that Germany’s
population grew from 16 to 17 million while a redistribution of economic activity rather than an overall decline
took place. Both views contain some truth. Some areas of
Germany were completely devastated while others remained relatively untouched and even experienced economic growth.
Rebellions
Before, during, and after the Thirty Years’ War, a series
of rebellions and civil wars stemming from the discontent of both nobles and commoners rocked the domestic
stability of many European governments. To strengthen
their power, monarchs attempted to extend their authority at the expense of traditional powerful elements
who resisted the rulers’ efforts. At the same time, to
fight their battles, governments increased taxes and
caused such hardships that common people also rose in
opposition.
Between 1590 and 1640, peasant and lower-class revolts occurred in central and southern France, Austria,
and Hungary. Portugal and Catalonia rebelled against the
Spanish government in 1640. Russia, too, was rocked by
urban uprisings in 1641, 1645, and 1648. Nobles rebelled
in France from 1648 to 1652 to halt the growth of royal
power. The northern states of Sweden, Denmark, and the
United Provinces were also not immune from upheavals
involving clergy, nobles, and mercantile groups. Even
relatively stable Switzerland had a peasant rebellion in
1656. The most famous and widest-ranging struggle,
however, was the civil war and rebellion in England,
commonly known as the English Revolution (discussed
later in this chapter).
The Practice of Absolutism:
Western Europe
Q Focus Question: What was absolutism in theory, and
how did its actual practice in France measure up
against the theory?
Absolute monarchy or absolutism meant that the sovereign power or ultimate authority in the state rested in the
hands of a king who claimed to rule by divine right---that
kings received their power from God and were responsible
to no one (including parliaments) except God. But what
did sovereignty mean? The late-sixteenth-century political
theorist Jean Bodin believed that sovereign power consisted of the authority to make laws, tax, mete out justice,
control the state’s administrative system, and determine
foreign policy. These powers made a ruler sovereign.
France: Foundations of Absolutism
France during the reign of Louis XIV (1643--1715) has
traditionally been regarded as the best example of the
practice of absolute monarchy in the seventeenth century.
French culture, language, and manners reached into all
levels of European society. French diplomacy and wars
shaped the political affairs of western and central Europe.
Of course, the stability of Louis’s reign was magnified by
the instability that had preceded it.
The fifty years of French history before Louis XIV
came to power were a time in which royal and ministerial
governments struggled to avoid the breakdown of the
state. The situation was especially complicated by the fact
that in 1610 and 1643, when Louis XIII (1610--1643) and
Louis XIV, respectively, succeeded to the throne, they were
only boys, leaving the government dependent on royal
ministers. Two especially competent ministers played
crucial roles in maintaining monarchical authority.
Cardinal Richelieu, Louis XIII’s chief minister from
1624 to 1642, initiated policies that eventually strengthened
the power of the monarchy. By eliminating the political
and military rights of the Huguenots while preserving their
religious ones, Richelieu transformed the Huguenots into
more reliable subjects. Richelieu acted more cautiously in
‘‘humbling the pride of the great men,’’ the important
French nobility. He understood the influential role played
by the nobles in the French state. The dangerous ones were
those who asserted their territorial independence when
they were excluded from participating in the central government. Proceeding slowly but determinedly, Richelieu
developed an efficient network of spies to uncover noble
plots and then crushed the conspiracies and executed the
conspirators, thereby eliminating a major threat to royal
authority.
When Louis XIV succeeded to the throne in 1643 at
the age of four, Cardinal Mazarin, the trained successor
of Cardinal Richelieu, dominated the government. An
Italian who had come to France as a papal legate and
then became naturalized, Mazarin attempted to carry on
Richelieu’s policies. The most important event during
Mazarin’s rule was the Fronde, a revolt led primarily by
nobles who wished to curb the centralized administrative
power being built up at the expense of the provincial
nobility. The Fronde was crushed by 1652, and with its
end, a vast number of French people concluded that the
best hope for stability in France lay in the crown. When
Mazarin died in 1661, the greatest of the seventeenthcentury monarchs, Louis XIV, took over supreme power.
The Reign of Louis XIV (1643--1715)
The day after Cardinal Mazarin’s death, Louis XIV, at the
age of twenty-three, expressed his determination to be a
real king and the sole ruler of France:
Up to this moment I have been pleased to entrust the government of my affairs to the late Cardinal. It is now time
that I govern them myself. You [secretaries and ministers of
state] will assist me with your counsels when I ask for them.
I request and order you to seal no orders except by my
command. . . . I order you not to sign anything, not even a
passport . . . without my command; to render account to me
personally each day and to favor no one.3
His mother, who was well aware of Louis’s proclivity for
fun and games and getting into the beds of the maids in
the royal palace, laughed aloud at these words. But Louis
was quite serious.
Louis proved willing to pay the price of being a
strong ruler. He established a conscientious routine from
which he seldom deviated. Eager for glory (in the French
sense of achieving what was expected of a person who
held an important position), Louis created a grand and
majestic spectacle at the court of Versailles. Consequently,
Louis and his court came to set the standard for monarchies and aristocracies all over Europe.
Although Louis may have believed in the theory of
absolute monarchy and consciously fostered the myth of
himself as the Sun King, the source of light for all of his
people, historians are quick to point out that the realities
fell far short of the aspirations. Despite the centralizing
efforts of Cardinals Richelieu and Mazarin, seventeenthcentury France still possessed a bewildering system of
overlapping authorities. Provinces had their own regional
courts, their own local Estates, their own sets of laws.
Members of the high nobility, with their huge estates, and
clients among the lesser nobility still exercised much
authority. Both towns and provinces possessed privileges
and powers seemingly from time immemorial that they
would not easily relinquish.
Administration of the Government One of the keys to
Louis’s power was that he was able to restructure the
central policy-making machinery of government because
it was part of his own court and household. The royal
court located at Versailles was an elaborate structure that
served three purposes simultaneously: it was the personal
household of the king, the location of central governmental machinery, and the place where powerful subjects
came to find favors and offices for themselves and their
clients, as well as the main arena where rival aristocratic
factions jostled for power. The greatest danger to Louis’s
personal rule came from the very high nobles and
‘‘princes of the blood’’ (royal princes) who considered it
their natural function to assert the policy-making role of
royal ministers. Louis eliminated this threat by removing
them from the royal council, the chief administrative
body of the king and overseer of the central machinery of
government, and enticing them to his court, where he
could keep them preoccupied with court life and out of
politics. In place of the high nobility and royal princes,
Louis relied for his ministers on other nobles. His ministers were expected to be subservient; said Louis, ‘‘I had
no intention of sharing my authority with them.’’
Louis’s domination of his ministers and secretaries
gave him control of the central policy-making machinery of
government and thus authority over the traditional areas of
monarchical power: the formulation of foreign policy, the
making of war and peace, the assertion of the secular power
of the crown against any religious authority, and the ability
to levy taxes to fulfill these functions. However, Louis had
considerably less success with the internal administration
of the kingdom. The traditional groups and institutions of
French society---the nobles, officials, town councils, guilds,
and representative Estates in some provinces---were simply
too powerful for the king to control. As a result, the actual
governing of the provinces and the people was accomplished largely by careful bribery of important people to
ensure that the king’s policies were carried out.
Religious Policy The maintenance of religious harmony had long been considered an area of monarchical
power. The desire to keep it led Louis to pursue an antiProtestant policy, aimed at converting the Huguenots to
Catholicism. In October 1685, Louis issued the Edict of
Fontainebleau. In addition to revoking the Edict of
Nantes, the new edict provided for the destruction of the
Huguenots’ churches and the closing of their schools.
Financial Issues The cost of building palaces, maintaining his court, and pursuing his wars made finances a
crucial issue for Louis XIV. He was most fortunate in
having the services of Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1619--1683)
as controller-general of finances. Colbert was an avid
practitioner of mercantilism. To decrease the need for
imports and increase exports, he founded new luxury
industries and granted special privileges, including tax
exemptions, loans, and subsidies, to individuals who established new industries. To improve communications
and the transportation of goods internally, he built roads
and canals. To decrease imports directly, Colbert raised
tariffs on foreign manufactured goods and created a
merchant marine to carry French goods.
The Wars of Louis XIV Both the increase in royal power
that Louis pursued and his desire for military glory led the
king to develop a professional army numbering 100,000
men in peacetime and 400,000 in time of war. Louis made
war an almost incessant activity of his reign. To achieve
the prestige and military glory befitting the Sun King as
well as to ensure the domination of his Bourbon dynasty
over European affairs, Louis waged four wars between
1667 and 1713. His ambitions roused much of Europe to
form coalitions to prevent destruction of the European
balance of power that Bourbon hegemony would cause.
Although Louis added some territory to France’s northeastern frontier and established a member of his own
Bourbon dynasty on the throne of Spain, he also left
France impoverished and surrounded by enemies.
The Decline of Spain
At the beginning of the seventeenth century, Spain possessed the most populous empire in the world, controlling almost all of South America and a number of
settlements in Asia and Africa. To most Europeans, Spain
still seemed the greatest power of the age, but the reality
was quite different. The treasury was empty; Philip II
went bankrupt in 1596 from excessive expenditures on
war, and his successor did the same in 1607 by spending a
fortune on his court. The armed forces were obsolescent,
the government was inefficient, and the commercial class
was weak in the midst of a suppressed peasantry, a
luxury-loving class of nobles, and an oversupply of priests
and monks.
During the reign of Philip III (1598--1621), many of
Spain’s weaknesses became all too apparent. Interested
only in court luxury or miracle-working relics, Philip III
allowed his first minister, the greedy duke of Lerma, to
run the country. The aristocratic Lerma’s primary interest
was accumulating power and wealth for himself and his
family. As important offices were filled with his relatives,
crucial problems went unsolved.
At first, the reign of Philip IV (1621--1665) seemed to
offer hope for a revival of Spain’s energies, especially in the
capable hands of his chief minister, Gaspar de Guzman,
the count of Olivares. This clever, dedicated, and powerhungry statesman worked to revive the interests of the
monarchy. A flurry of domestic reform decrees, aimed at
curtailing the power of the church and the landed aristocracy, was soon followed by a political reform program
whose purpose was to further centralize the government
of all Spain and its possessions in monarchical hands. All
of these efforts met with little real success, however, because both the number (estimated at one-fifth of the
population) and power of the Spanish aristocrats made
them too strong to curtail in any significant fashion.
At the same time, most of the efforts of Olivares and
Philip were undermined by their desire to pursue Spain’s
imperial glory and by a series of internal revolts. Spain’s
involvement in the Thirty Years’ War led to a series of
frightfully expensive military campaigns that provoked
internal revolts and years of civil war. Unfortunately for
Spain, the campaigns also failed to produce victory. As
Olivares wrote to King Philip IV, ‘‘God wants us to make
peace; for He is depriving us visibly and absolutely of all
the means of war.’’4
The defeats in Europe and the internal revolts of the
1640s ended any illusions about Spain’s greatness. The actual extent of its economic difficulties is still debated, but
there is no question about its foreign losses. Dutch independence was formally recognized by the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, and the Peace of the Pyrenees with France in
1659 meant the surrender of some border regions to France.
Absolutism in Central
and Eastern Europe
Q Focus Question: What developments enabled
Brandenburg-Prussia, Austria, and Russia to emerge
as major powers in the seventeenth century?
During the seventeenth century, a development of great
importance for the modern Western world took place in
central and eastern Europe, the appearance of three new
powers: Prussia, Austria, and Russia.
The German States
The Peace of Westphalia, which officially ended the Thirty
Years’ War in 1648, left each of the more than three
hundred German states comprising the Holy Roman
Empire virtually autonomous and sovereign. Of these
states, two emerged in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries as great European powers.
The Rise of Brandenburg-Prussia The development of
Brandenburg as a state was largely the story of the Hohenzollern dynasty. By the seventeenth century, the dominions
of the house of Hohenzollern, now called BrandenburgPrussia, consisted of three disconnected masses in western,
central, and eastern Germany (see Map 15.2).
The foundation for the Prussian state was laid by
Frederick William the Great Elector (1640--1688). Realizing that Brandenburg-Prussia was a small, open territory with no natural frontiers for defense, Frederick
William built an army of forty thousand men, making it
the fourth largest in Europe. To sustain the army, Frederick William established the General War Commissariat
to levy taxes to support the army and oversee its growth.
The Commissariat soon evolved into an agency for civil
government as well. Directly responsible to the elector,
the new bureaucratic machine became his chief instrument to govern the state. Many of its officials were
members of the Prussian landed aristocracy, the Junkers,
who also served as officers in the all-important army.
Frederick William was succeeded by his son Frederick
III (1688--1713), who made one significant contribution to
the development of Prussia. In return for his commitment
to aid the Holy Roman Emperor in a war against Spain,
he received the title of King-in-Prussia in 1701. Elector
Frederick III was transformed into King Frederick I, and
Brandenburg-Prussia became simply Prussia. In the eighteenth century, Prussia emerged as a great power on the
European stage.
The Emergence of Austria
The Austrian Habsburgs had long played a significant role
in European politics as Holy Roman Emperors. By the
end of the Thirty Years’ War, the Habsburg hopes of
forging an empire in Germany had been dashed. In the
seventeenth century, the house of Austria assembled a
new empire in eastern and southeastern Europe.
The nucleus of the new Austrian Empire remained the
traditional Austrian hereditary possessions: Lower and
Upper Austria, Carinthia, Carniola, Styria, and Tyrol (see
Map 15.3). To these had been added the kingdom of
Bohemia and parts of northwestern Hungary in the sixteenth century. In the seventeenth century, Leopold I
(1658--1705) encouraged the eastward movement of the
Austrian Empire, but he was sorely challenged by the revival of Ottoman power. The Ottomans eventually pushed
westward and laid siege to Vienna in 1683. A European
army, led by the Austrians, counterattacked and decisively
defeated the Ottomans in 1687. Austria took control of
Hungary, Transylvania, Croatia, and Slovenia, thus establishing an Austrian Empire in southeastern Europe. By
the beginning of the eighteenth century, the house of
Austria had acquired an empire of considerable size.
Yet Austria never became a highly centralized, absolutist state, primarily because it contained so many different
national groups. The empire remained a collection of territories held together by a personal union. The Habsburg
emperor was archduke of Austria, king of Bohemia, and
king of Hungary. Each of these areas, however, had its own
laws, Estates-General, and political life.
Russia: From Fledgling Principality
to Major Power
A new Russian state had emerged in the fifteenth century
under the leadership of the principality of Moscow and its
grand dukes. In the sixteenth century, Ivan IV the Terrible
(1533--1584) was the first ruler to take the title of tsar (the
Russian word for ‘‘Caesar’’). Ivan expanded the territories
of Russia eastward and also extended the autocracy of the
tsar by crushing the power of the Russian nobility, known
as the boyars. Ivan’s dynasty came to an end in 1598 and
was followed by a resurgence of aristocratic power in a
period of anarchy known as the Time of Troubles. It did
not end until the Zemsky Sobor, or national assembly,
chose Michael Romanov in 1613 as the new tsar, beginning a dynasty that lasted until 1917.
In the seventeenth century, Muscovite society was
highly stratified. At the top was the tsar, who claimed to
be a divinely ordained autocratic ruler. Russian society
was dominated by an upper class of landed aristocrats
who, in the course of the seventeenth century, managed
to bind their peasants to the land. Townspeople were also
controlled. Many merchants were not allowed to move
from their cities without government permission or to
sell their businesses to anyone outside their class. In the
seventeenth century, merchant and peasant revolts as well
as a schism in the Russian Orthodox Church created very
unsettled conditions. In the midst of these political and
religious upheavals, Russia was experiencing more frequent contacts with the West, and Western ideas were
beginning to penetrate a few Russian circles. At the end of
the seventeenth century, Peter the Great noticeably accelerated this westernizing process.
The Reign of Peter the Great (1689–1725) Peter the
Great was an unusual character. A strong man towering
6 feet 9 inches tall, Peter enjoyed low humor---belching
contests and crude jokes---and vicious punishments---
flogging, impalings, and roastings (see the box above). He
got a firsthand view of the West when he made a trip
there in 1697--1698 and returned home determined to
Europeanize Russia. He was especially eager to borrow
European technology, convinced it would give him the
military muscle he needed to make Russia a great power.
As could be expected, one of his first priorities was
the reorganization of the armed forces. Employing both
Russians and Europeans as officers, he conscripted peasants for twenty-five-year stints of service to build a
standing army of 210,000 men. Peter has also been given
credit for forming the first Russian navy.
Peter reorganized the central government, partly along
Western lines. To impose the rule of the central government more effectively throughout the land, he divided
Russia into eight provinces and later, in 1719, into fifty.
Although he hoped to create a ‘‘police state,’’ by which he
meant a well-ordered community governed in accordance
with law, few of his bureaucrats shared his concept of
honest service and duty to the state. Peter hoped for a
sense of civic duty, but his own forceful personality created
an atmosphere of fear that prevented it.
Peter also sought to gain state control of the Russian
Orthodox Church. In 1721, he abolished the position of
patriarch and created a body called the Holy Synod to make
decisions for the church. At its head stood a procurator,
a layman who represented the interests of the tsar and assured Peter of effective domination of the church.
Immediately upon returning from his trip to the
West in 1698, Peter began to introduce Western customs,
practices, and manners into Russia. He ordered the
preparation of the first Russian book of etiquette to teach
Western manners. Among other things, it pointed out
that it was not polite to spit on the floor or scratch oneself
at dinner. Because Westerners did not wear beards or the
traditional long-skirted coat, Russian beards had to be
shaved and coats shortened, a reform Peter personally
enforced at court by shaving off his nobles’ beards and
cutting their coats at the knees with his own hands.
Outside the court, the edicts were enforced by barbers
and tailors planted at town gates with orders to cut the
beards and cloaks of all who entered or left.
One group of Russians benefited greatly from Peter’s
cultural reforms---women. Having watched women mixing
freely with men in Western courts, Peter shattered the seclusion of upper-class Russian women and demanded that
they remove the traditional veils that covered their faces.
Peter also decreed that social gatherings be held three times
a week in the large houses of Saint Petersburg where men
and women could mix for conversation, card games, and
dancing, which Peter had learned in the West. The tsar also
now insisted that women could marry of their own free will.
The object of Peter’s domestic reforms was to make
Russia into a great state and military power. His primary
goal was to ‘‘open a window to the West,’’ which required an
ice-free port easily accessible to Europe. This could be
achieved only on the Baltic, but at that time the Baltic coast
was controlled by Sweden, the most important power in
northern Europe. Desirous of these lands, Peter attacked
Sweden in the summer of 1700, believing that its young
king, Charles XII, could easily be defeated. Charles, however, proved to be a brilliant general and, with a welldisciplined force of only eight thousand men, routed the
Russian army of forty thousand at the Battle of Narva
(1700). The Great Northern War (1701--1721) soon ensued.
Peter fought back. He reorganized his army along
Western lines and at the Battle of Poltava in July 1709
decisively defeated Charles’s army. Although the war
dragged on for another twelve years, the Peace of Nystadt
in 1721 gave formal recognition to what Peter had already
achieved: the acquisition of Estonia, Livonia, and Karelia
(see Map 15.4). Sweden became a second-rate power, and
Russia was now the great European state Peter had
envisioned. Already in 1703, Peter had begun the construction of a new city on the Baltic, Saint Petersburg,
his window to the West and a symbol that Russia was
looking toward Europe. Peter realized his dream: by the
time of his death in 1725, Russia had become a great
military power and an important actor on the European
stage.
The Ottoman Empire
After their conquest of Constantinople in 1453, the
Ottoman Turks tried but failed to complete their conquest of the Balkans, where they had been established
since the fourteenth century (see Map 15.3). The reign
of Sultan Suleiman I the Magnificent (1520--1566),
however, brought the Ottomans back to Europe’s attention. Advancing up the Danube, the Ottomans seized
Belgrade in 1521 and Hungary by 1526, although their
attempts to conquer Vienna in 1529 were repulsed. At
the same time, the Ottomans extended their power into
the western Mediterranean, threatening to turn it into
an Ottoman lake until a large Ottoman fleet was destroyed by the Spanish at Lepanto (in modern-day Greece)
in 1571. Despite the defeat, the Ottomans continued to
hold nominal control over the southern European shores
along the Mediterranean.
Although Europeans frequently spoke of new Christian crusades against the ‘‘infidel’’ Ottomans, by the
beginning of the seventeenth century, the Ottoman
Empire was being treated like any other European power
by European rulers seeking alliances and trade concessions. In the first half of the century, the empire was
a ‘‘sleeping giant.’’ Occupied by domestic bloodletting
and severely threatened by a challenge from Persia, the
Ottomans were content with the status quo in eastern
Europe. But under a new line of grand viziers in the
second half of the seventeenth century, the Ottoman
Empire again took the offensive. By 1683, the Ottomans
had marched through the Hungarian plain and laid siege
to Vienna. Repulsed by a mixed army of Austrians, Poles,
Bavarians, and Saxons, the Ottomans retreated and
were pushed out of Hungary by a new European coalition. Although they retained the core of their empire,
the Ottoman Turks would never again be a threat to
Europe.
The Limits of Absolutism
In recent decades, historical studies of local institutions
have challenged the traditional picture of absolute
monarchs. It is misleading to think that these rulers
actually controlled the lives of their subjects. In 1700,
government for most people still meant the local institutions that affected their lives: local courts, local tax
collectors, and local organizers of armed forces. Kings
and ministers might determine policies and issue
guidelines, but they still had to function through local
agents and had no guarantee that their wishes would be
carried out. A mass of urban and provincial privileges,
liberties, and exemptions (including from taxation) and
a whole host of corporate bodies and interest groups---
provincial and national Estates, clerical officials, officeholders who had bought or inherited their positions, and
provincial nobles---limited what monarchs could achieve.
The most successful rulers were not those who tried to
destroy the old system but rather those like Louis XIV
who knew how to use the old system to their advantage.
Above all other considerations stood the landholding
nobility. Everywhere in the seventeenth century, the
landed aristocracy played an important role in the European monarchical system. As military officers, judges,
officeholders, and landowners in control of vast, untaxed
estates, their power remained immense. In some places,
their strength even put severe limits on how effectively
monarchs could rule.
Limited Monarchy: The Dutch
Republic and England
Q Focus Question: What were the main issues in the
struggle between king and Parliament in seventeenthcentury England, and how were they resolved?
Almost everywhere in Europe in the seventeenth century,
kings and their ministers were in control of central governments. But not all European states followed the pattern of absolute monarchy. In western Europe, two great
states---the Dutch Republic and England---successfully
resisted the power of hereditary monarchs.
The Golden Age of the Dutch Republic
The seventeenth century has often been called the golden
age of the Dutch Republic as the United Provinces held
center stage as one of Europe’s great powers. Like France
and England, the United Provinces was an Atlantic power,
underlining the importance of that shift of political and
economic power in the seventeenth century from the
Mediterranean Sea to the countries on the Atlantic seaboard.
As a result of the sixteenth-century revolt of the Netherlands, the seven northern provinces, which began to call
themselves the United Provinces of the Netherlands in 1581,
became the core of the modern Dutch state. The new state
was officially recognized by the Peace of Westphalia in 1648.
With independence came internal dissension. There
were two chief centers of political power in the new state.
Each province had an official known as a stadholder who
was responsible for leading the army and maintaining
order. Beginning with William of Orange and his heirs,
the house of Orange occupied the stadholderate in most
provinces and favored the development of a centralized
government with themselves as hereditary monarchs. The
States General, an assembly of representatives from every
province, opposed the Orangist ambitions and advocated
a decentralized or republican form of government. For
much of the seventeenth century, the republican forces
were in control. But in 1672, burdened with war against
both France and England, the United Provinces allowed
William III (1672--1702) of the house of Orange to establish a monarchical regime. However, his death in 1702
without direct heirs enabled the republican forces to gain
control once more. The Dutch Republic would not be
seriously threatened again by the monarchical forces.
Underlying Dutch prominence in the seventeenth
century was its economic prosperity, fueled by the role of
the Dutch as carriers of European trade. But war proved
disastrous to the Dutch Republic. Wars with France and
England placed heavy burdens on Dutch finances and
manpower. English shipping began to challenge what had
been Dutch commercial supremacy, and by 1715, the
Dutch were experiencing a serious economic decline.
England and the Emergence
of Constitutional Monarchy
One of the most prominent examples of resistance to
absolute monarchy came in seventeenth-century England,
where king and Parliament struggled to determine the
role each should play in governing the nation.
King James I and Parliament With the death of Queen
Elizabeth in 1603, the Tudor dynasty became extinct, and
the Stuart line of rulers was inaugurated with the accession to the throne of Elizabeth’s cousin, King James VI of
Scotland, who became James I (1603--1625) of England.
James espoused the divine right of kings, a viewpoint that
alienated Parliament, which had grown accustomed under the Tudors to act on the premise that monarch and
Parliament together ruled England as a ‘‘balanced polity.’’
Parliament expressed its displeasure with James’s claims
by refusing his requests for additional monies he needed
to meet the increased cost of government. Parliament’s
power of the purse proved to be its trump card in its
relationship with the king.
Some members of Parliament were also alienated by
James’s religious policy. The Puritans---Protestants within
the Anglican church inspired by Calvinist theology---
wanted James to eliminate the episcopal system of church
organization used in the Church of England (in which the
bishop or episcopos played the major administrative role)
in favor of a Presbyterian model (used in Scotland and
patterned after Calvin’s church organization in Geneva,
where ministers and elders---also called presbyters---played
an important governing role). James refused because he
realized that the Anglican church, with its bishops appointed by the crown, was a major supporter of monarchical authority. But the Puritans were not easily cowed
and added to the rising chorus of opposition to the king.
Many of England’s gentry, mostly well-to-do landowners
below the level of the nobility, had become Puritans, and
these Puritan gentry formed an important and substantial
part of the House of Commons, the lower house of
Parliament. It was not wise to alienate them.
Charles I and the Move Toward Revolution The conflict that began during the reign of James came to a head
during the reign of his son, Charles I (1625--1649). In
1628, Parliament passed a petition of right that the king
was supposed to accept before being granted any tax
revenues. This petition prohibited levying taxes without
Parliament’s consent, arbitrary imprisonment, the quartering of soldiers in private houses, and the declaration of
martial law in peacetime. Although he initially accepted
it, Charles later reneged on the agreement because of its
limitations on royal power. In 1629, Charles decided that
because he could not work with Parliament, he would not
summon it to meet. From 1629 to 1640, Charles pursued
a course of ‘‘personal rule,’’ which forced him to find ways
to collect taxes without Parliament’s cooperation. These
expedients aroused opposition from middle-class merchants and landed gentry who believed that the king was
attempting to tax without Parliament’s consent.
The king’s religious policy also proved disastrous. His
attempt to impose more ritual on the Anglican church
struck the Puritans as a return to Catholic popery. Charles’s
efforts to force them to conform to his religious policies
infuriated the Puritans, thousands of whom abandoned
England for the ‘‘howling wildernesses’’ of America.
Civil War and a New Government Grievances mounted
until England finally slipped into a civil war (1642--1648)
that was won by the parliamentary forces. Most
important to Parliament’s
success was the creation
of the New Model Army,
one of whose leaders was
Oliver Cromwell, the only
real military genius of the
war. The New Model
Army was composed primarily of more extreme
Puritans known as the
Independents, who, in
typical Calvinist fashion,
believed they were doing
battle for the Lord. As
Cromwell wrote in one of
his military reports, ‘‘Sir, this is none other but the hand
of God; and to Him alone belongs the glory.’’
Between 1648 and 1660, England faced a trying situation. After the execution of Charles I on January 30,
1649, Parliament abolished the monarchy and the House
of Lords and proclaimed England a republic or commonwealth. But Cromwell and his army, unable to work
effectively with Parliament, dispersed it by force. As the
members of Parliament departed in April 1653, Cromwell
shouted after them, ‘‘It’s you that have forced me to do
this, for I have sought the Lord night and day that He
would slay me rather than put upon me the doing of this
work.’’ With the certainty of one who is convinced he is
right, Cromwell had destroyed both king and Parliament.
Finally, Cromwell dissolved Parliament and divided
the country into eleven regions, each ruled by a major
general who served as a military governor. Unable to establish a constitutional basis for a working government,
Cromwell had resorted to military force to maintain the
rule of the Independents.
Oliver Cromwell died in 1658. After floundering for
eighteen months, the military establishment decided that
arbitrary rule by the army was no longer feasible and
reestablished the monarchy in the person of Charles II
(1660--1685), the son of Charles I. The restoration of the
Stuart monarchy ended England’s time of troubles, but it
was not long before yet another constitutional crisis arose.
Restoration and a Glorious Revolution Charles was
sympathetic to and perhaps even inclined to Catholicism.
Moreover, Charles’s brother James, heir to the throne, did
not hide the fact that he was a Catholic. Parliament’s
suspicions were therefore aroused in 1672 when Charles
took the audacious step of issuing a declaration of indulgence that suspended the laws that Parliament had
passed against Catholics and Puritans after the restoration
of the Anglican church as the official church of England.
Parliament would have none of it and induced the king
to suspend the declaration. Propelled by strong antiCatholic sentiment, Parliament then passed the Test Act
of 1673, specifying that only Anglicans could hold military and civil offices.
The accession of James II (1685--1688) to the crown
virtually guaranteed a new constitutional crisis for England.
An open and devout Catholic, his attempt to further
Catholic interests made religion once more a primary
cause of conflict between king and Parliament. In 1687,
James issued a declaration of indulgence that suspended
all laws that excluded Catholics and Puritans from office.
Parliamentary outcries against James’s policies stopped
short of rebellion because members knew that he was an
old man and his successors were his Protestant daughters
Mary and Anne, born to his first wife. But on June 10,
1688, a son was born to James II’s second wife, also a
Catholic. Suddenly the specter of a Catholic hereditary
monarchy loomed large. A group of prominent English
noblemen invited the Dutch chief executive, William of
Orange, husband of James’s daughter Mary, to invade
England. William and Mary raised an army and invaded
England while James, his wife, and their infant son fled to
France. With almost no bloodshed, England had undergone its ‘‘Glorious Revolution,’’ not over the issue of
whether there would be monarchy but rather over who
would be monarch.
In January 1689, Parliament offered the throne to
William and Mary, who accepted it along with the provisions of a bill of rights (see the box above). The Bill of
Rights affirmed Parliament’s right to make laws and levy
taxes and made it impossible for kings to oppose or do
without Parliament by stipulating that standing armies
could be raised only with the consent of Parliament. The
rights of citizens to petition the sovereign, keep arms,
have a jury trial, and not be subject to excessive bail were
also confirmed. The Bill of Rights helped fashion a system
of government based on the rule of law and a freely
elected Parliament, thus laying the foundation for a
constitutional monarchy.
The Bill of Rights did not settle the religious questions that had played such a large role in England’s
troubles in the seventeenth century. The Toleration Act of
1689 granted Puritan dissenters the right of free public
worship (Catholics were still excluded). Although the
Toleration Act did not mean complete religious freedom
and equality, it marked a departure in English history in
that few people would ever again be persecuted for religious reasons.
Many historians have viewed the Glorious Revolution as the end of the seventeenth-century struggle
between king and Parliament. By deposing one king
and establishing another, Parliament had destroyed the
divine-right theory of kingship (William was, after all,
king by grace of Parliament, not God) and confirmed its
right to participate in the government. Parliament did
not have complete control of the government, but it now
had an unquestioned right to participate in affairs of
state. During the next century, it would gradually prove
to be the real authority in the English system of constitutional monarchy.
Responses to Revolution The English revolutions of
the seventeenth century prompted very different responses
from two English political thinkers, Thomas Hobbes and
John Locke. Thomas Hobbes (1588--1679), who lived
during the English Civil War, was alarmed by the revolutionary upheavals in his contemporary England. His name
has since been associated with the state’s claim to absolute
authority over its subjects, which he elaborated in his
major treatise on political thought known as the Leviathan,
published in 1651.
Hobbes claimed that in the state of nature, before
society was organized, human life was ‘‘solitary, poor,
nasty, brutish, and short.’’ Humans were guided by
animalistic instincts and a ruthless struggle for selfpreservation. To save themselves from destroying each
other (the ‘‘war of every man against every man’’), people
contracted to form a commonwealth, which Hobbes
called ‘‘that great Leviathan (or rather, to speak more
reverently, that mortal god) to which we owe our peace
and defense.’’ This commonwealth placed its collective
power in the hands of a sovereign authority, preferably
a single ruler, who served as executor, legislator, and
judge. This absolute ruler possessed unlimited power. In
Hobbes’s view, subjects may not rebel; if they do, they
must be suppressed.
John Locke (1632--1704), author of a political
work called Two Treatises of Government, viewed the
exercise of political power quite differently from Hobbes
and argued against the absolute rule of one man.
Like Hobbes, Locke began with the state of nature before
human existence became organized socially. But unlike
Hobbes, Locke believed that humans lived then in a
state of equality and freedom rather than a state of war.
In this state of nature, humans had certain inalienable
natural rights---to life, liberty, and property. Like
Hobbes, Locke did not believe that all was well in the
state of nature, and people found it difficult to protect
these rights. So they mutually agreed to establish a
government to ensure the protection of their rights. This
agreement established mutual obligations: government
would protect the rights of people, and the people would
act reasonably toward their government. But if a government broke this agreement---if a king, for example,
failed to live up to his obligation to protect the people’s
rights or claimed absolute authority and made laws
without the consent of the community---the people
might form a new government. For Locke, however, the
community of people was primarily the landholding
aristocracy who were represented in Parliament, not the
landless masses. Locke was hardly an advocate of political democracy, but his ideas proved important to
both the Americans and the French in the eighteenth
century and were used to support demands for constitutional government, the rule of law, and the protection
of rights.
The Flourishing of
European Culture
Q Focus Question: What were the main features of art
and literature in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries?
In the midst of religious wars and the growth of absolutism, European culture continued to flourish. The era was
blessed with a number of prominent artists and writers.
The Changing Faces of Art
After the Renaissance, European art passed through a
number of stylistic stages. The artistic Renaissance came
to an end when a new movement called Mannerism
emerged in Italy in the 1520s and 1530s.
Mannerism The Reformation had brought a revival of
religious values accompanied by much political turmoil.
Especially in Italy, the worldly enthusiasm of the Renaissance gave way to anxiety, uncertainty, suffering, and
a yearning for spiritual experience. Mannerism reflected
this environment in its deliberate attempt to break down
the High Renaissance principles of balance, harmony, and
moderation. Italian Mannerist painters deliberately distorted the rules of proportion by portraying elongated
figures that conveyed a sense of suffering and a strong
emotional atmosphere filled with anxiety and confusion.
The Baroque Mannerism was eventually replaced by a
new movement---the Baroque---that dominated the artistic world for another century and a half. The Baroque
began in Italy in the last quarter of the sixteenth century
and spread to the rest of Europe. Baroque artists sought
to harmonize the Classical traditions of Renaissance art
with the intense religious feelings fostered by the revival
of religion in the Reformation. Although Protestants were
also affected, the Baroque was most wholeheartedly embraced by the Catholic reform movement, as is evident at
the Catholic courts, especially those of the Habsburgs in
Madrid, Prague, Vienna, and Brussels. Eventually, the
Baroque style spread to all of Europe and Latin America.
In large part, Baroque art and architecture reflected
the search for power that was characteristic of much of the
seventeenth century. Baroque churches and palaces featured richly ornamented facades, sweeping staircases, and
an overall splendor intended to impress people. Kings and
princes wanted their subjects---as well as other kings
and princes---to be in awe of their power. The Catholic
church, which commissioned many new churches, wanted
people to see the triumphant power of the Catholic faith.
Baroque painting was known for its use of dramatic
effects to heighten emotional intensity. This style was
especially evident in the works of the Flemish painter
Peter Paul Rubens (1577--1640), a prolific artist and an
important figure in the spread of the Baroque from Italy
to other parts of Europe. In his artistic masterpieces,
bodies in vigorous motion, fleshy nudes, a dramatic use
of light and shadow, and rich, sensuous pigments convey
intense emotions. The restless forms and sense of movement blend into a dynamic unity.
Perhaps the greatest figure of the Baroque was the
Italian architect and sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini
(1598--1680), who completed Saint Peter’s Basilica and
designed the vast colonnade enclosing the piazza in front
of it. Action, exuberance, profusion, and dramatic effects
mark his work in the interior of Saint Peter’s, where
Bernini’s Throne of Saint Peter hovers in midair, held by
the hands of the four great doctors of the Catholic
church.
Less well known than the male artists who dominated
the seventeenth-century art world in Italy but prominent
in her own right was Artemisia Gentileschi (1593--1653).
Born in Rome, she studied painting under her father’s
direction. In 1616, she moved to Florence and began a
successful career as a painter. At the age of twenty-three,
she became the first woman to be elected to the Florentine Academy of Design. Although she was known internationally in her day as a portrait painter, her fame
now rests on a series of pictures of heroines from the Old
Testament, including Judith, Esther, and Bathsheba. Most
famous is her Judith Beheading Holofernes, a dramatic
rendering of the biblical scene in which Judith slays the
Assyrian general Holofernes in order to save her besieged
town from the Assyrian army.
French Classicism and Dutch Realism In the second
half of the seventeenth century, France replaced Italy as
the cultural leader of Europe. Rejecting the Baroque style
as showy and overly passionate, the French remained
committed to the Classical values of the High Renaissance. French late classicism, with its emphasis on clarity,
simplicity, balance, and harmony of design, was, however,
a rather austere version of the High Renaissance style. Its
triumph reflected the shift in seventeenth-century French
society from chaos to order. While rejecting the emotionalism and high drama of the Baroque, French classicism continued the Baroque’s conception of grandeur in
the portrayal of noble subjects, especially those from
Classical antiquity.
The supremacy of Dutch commerce in the seventeenth century was paralleled by a brilliant flowering of
Dutch painting. Wealthy patricians and burghers of Dutch
urban society commissioned works of art for their guild
halls, town halls, and private dwellings. Following the
wishes of these patrons, Dutch painters became primarily
interested in the realistic portrayal of secular, everyday life.
The finest exemplar of the golden age of Dutch
painting was Rembrandt van Rijn (1606--1669). Although
Rembrandt shared the Dutch predilection for realistic
portraits, he became more introspective as he grew older.
He refused to follow his contemporaries, whose pictures
were largely secular in subject matter; half of his paintings
focused on scenes from biblical tales. Because the traditional Protestant hostility toward religious pictures had
discouraged artistic expression, Rembrandt stands out as
the one great Protestant painter of the seventeenth century.
A Wondrous Age of Theater
In both England and Spain, writing for the stage reached
new heights between 1580 and 1640. The golden age of
English literature is often called the Elizabethan era because much of this English cultural flowering occurred
during the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Elizabethan literature exhibits the exuberance and pride associated with
English exploits at the time. Of all the forms of Elizabethan literature, none expressed the energy and intellectual
versatility of the era better than drama. And of all the
dramatists, none is more famous than William Shakespeare (1564--1614).
William Shakespeare Shakespeare was the son of a
prosperous glove maker from Stratford-upon-Avon.
When he appeared in London in 1592, Elizabethans were
already addicted to the stage. In Greater London, as many
as six theaters were open six afternoons a week. London
theaters ranged from the Globe, which was a circular
unroofed structure holding three thousand spectators, to
the Blackfriars, which was roofed and held only five
hundred. In the former, the admission charge of only a
penny or two enabled even the lower classes to attend,
while the higher prices charged in the latter attracted the
well-to-do. Elizabethan audiences varied greatly, consisting as they did of nobles, lawyers, merchants, and even
vagabonds---putting pressure on playwrights to create
works that pleased all.
Shakespeare was a ‘‘complete man of the theater.’’
Although best known for writing plays, he was also an
actor and a shareholder in the chief performing company
of the time, the Lord Chamberlain’s Company, which
played in theaters as diverse as the Globe and the Blackfriars. Shakespeare has long been recognized as a universal
genius. He was a master of the English language, but this
technical proficiency was matched by an incredible insight
into human psychology. In both tragedies and comedies,
Shakespeare exhibited a remarkable understanding of the
human condition (see the box on p. 336).
Spain’s Golden Century The theater was one of the
most creative forms of expression during Spain’s golden
century. The first professional theaters founded in Seville
and Madrid in the 1570s were run by actors’ companies,
as in England. Soon a public playhouse could be found in
every large town, including Mexico City in the New
World. Touring companies brought the latest Spanish
plays to all parts of the Spanish Empire.
Beginning in the 1580s, the agenda for playwrights
was set by Lope de Vega (1562--1635). Like Shakespeare,
he was from a middle-class background. He was an incredibly prolific writer; almost one-third of his fifteen
hundred plays survive. They have been characterized as
witty, charming, action-packed, and realistic. Lope de
Vega made no apologies for the fact that he wrote his plays
to please his audiences. In a treatise on drama written in
1609, he stated that the foremost duty of the playwright
was to satisfy public demand. He remarked that if anyone
thought he had written his plays for fame, ‘‘undeceive him
and tell him that I wrote them for money.’’
French Drama As the great age of theater in England
and Spain was drawing to a close around 1630, a new
dramatic era began to dawn in France that lasted into the
1680s. Unlike Shakespeare in England and Lope de Vega
in Spain, French playwrights wrote more for an elite
audience and were forced to depend on royal patronage.
Louis XIV used theater as he did art and architecture---to
attract attention to his monarchy. French dramatists
cultivated a Classical style that emphasized the clever,
polished, and correct over the emotional and imaginative.
Many of the French works of this period derived their
themes and plots from Greek and Roman sources.
Jean-Baptiste Molie`re (1622--1673) enjoyed the favor
of the French court and benefited from the patronage of
the Sun King. He wrote, produced, and acted in a series of
comedies that often satirized the religious and social
world of his time. In The Misanthrope, he mocked the
corruption of court society, while in Tartuffe, he ridiculed
religious hypocrisy. Molie`re’s satires, however, sometimes
got him into trouble. The Paris clergy did not find Tartuffe funny and had it banned for five years. Only the
protection of Louis XIV saved Molie`re from more severe
harassment.

CONCLUSION
To many historians, the seventeenth century has assumed extraordinary proportions. The divisive effects of the Reformation had
been assimilated, and the concept of a united Christendom, held as
an ideal since the Middle Ages, had been irrevocably destroyed by
the religious wars, making possible the emergence of a system of
nation-states in which power politics took on increasing significance. The growth of political thought focusing on the secular
origins of state power reflected the changes that were going on in
seventeenth-century society.
Within those states, there slowly emerged some of the
machinery that made possible a growing centralization of power.
In those states called absolutist, strong monarchs with the assistance
of their aristocracies took the lead in providing the leadership for
greater centralization. But in England, where the landed aristocracy
gained power at the expense of the monarchs, the foundations were
laid for a constitutional government in which Parliament provided
the focus for the institutions of centralized power. In all the major
European states, a growing concern for power and dynastic
expansion led to larger armies and greater conflict. War remained
an endemic feature of Western civilization.
But the search for order and harmony continued, evident in art
and literature. At the same time, religious preoccupations and values
were losing ground to secular considerations. The seventeenth
century was a period of transition toward the more secular spirit that
has characterized modern Western civilization ever since. No stronger
foundation for this spirit could be found than in the new view of the
universe that was ushered in by the Scientific Revolution of the
seventeenth century, and it is to that story that we now turn.
