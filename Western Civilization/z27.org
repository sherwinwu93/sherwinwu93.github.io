and World War II, and what were the differences in
the way the wars were fought?
Adolf Hitler salutes military leaders and soldiers during a military rally.

ON FEBRUARY 3, 1933, only four days after he had been
appointed chancellor of Germany, Adolf Hitler met secretly with
Germany’s leading generals. He revealed to them his desire to remove the ‘‘cancer of democracy,’’ create a new authoritarian leadership, and forge a new domestic unity. All Germans would need to
realize that ‘‘only a struggle can save us and that everything else
must be subordinated to this idea.’’ Youth especially must be trained
and their will strengthened ‘‘to fight with all means.’’ Because
Germany’s living space was too small for its people, above all, Hitler
said, Germany must rearm and prepare for ‘‘the conquest of new
living space in the east and its ruthless Germanization.’’ Even before
he had consolidated his power, Adolf Hitler had a clear vision of his
goals, and their implementation meant another European war.
World War II was clearly Hitler’s war. Although other countries may
have helped make the war possible by not resisting Hitler’s Germany
earlier, Nazi Germany’s actions made World War II inevitable.
This chapter focuses on the European theater of war, but both
European and American armies were involved in fighting around
the world. World War II was actually two major conflicts, one provoked by the ambitions of Germany in Europe and the other by the
ambitions of Japan in Asia. By 1941, with the United States drawn
into both, the two had merged into a single global conflict.
Although World War I has been described as a total war, World
War II was even more so and was fought on a scale unheard of in
history. Almost everyone in the warring countries was involved in
one way or another: as soldiers; as workers in wartime industries; as
ordinary citizens subject to invading armies, military occupation, or
bombing raids; as refugees; or as victims of mass extermination.
The world had never witnessed such widespread intentional death
and destruction.
Prelude to War
Q Focus Questions: What were Hitler’s foreign policy
goals, and what steps did he take to achieve them
between 1933 and 1939? How did Japan’s policies lead
to war in Asia?
Only twenty years after the ‘‘war to end war,’’ the world
plunged back into the nightmare of total war. The efforts
at collective security in the 1920s---the League of Nations,
the attempts at disarmament, the pacts and treaties---all
proved meaningless in light of the ambitions of Nazi
Germany and its deliberate scrapping of the postwar
settlement in the 1930s.
The ‘‘Diplomatic Revolution,’’ 1933--1937
World War II in Europe began in the mind of Adolf
Hitler, who believed that only the ‘‘Aryans’’ were capable
of building a great civilization. But the Germans, in his
view the purest Aryans, were threatened from the east by
a large mass of inferior peoples, the Slavs, who had
learned to use German weapons and technology. Germany
needed more land to support a larger population and be
a great power. Already in the 1920s, in the second volume
of Mein Kampf, Hitler had indicated where a National
Socialist regime would find this land: ‘‘And so we
National Socialists . . . take up where we broke off six
hundred years ago. We stop the endless German movement to the south and west, and turn our gaze toward the
land in the east. . . . If we speak of soil in Europe today, we
can primarily have in mind only Russia and her vassal
border states.’’1 Once it had been conquered, the land of
Russia could be resettled by German peasants while the
Slavic population could be used as slave labor to build the
Aryan racial state that would dominate Europe for a
thousand years. Hitler was unequivocal: Germany must
prepare for its inevitable war with the Soviet Union.
When Hitler became chancellor of Germany on
January 30, 1933, Germany’s situation in Europe seemed
weak. The Treaty of Versailles had created a demilitarized
zone on Germany’s western border that would allow the
French to move into the heavily industrialized parts of
Germany in the event of war. To Germany’s east, the
smaller states, such as Poland and Czechoslovakia, had
defensive treaties with France. The Versailles treaty had
also limited Germany’s army to 100,000 troops with no
air force and minimal naval forces.
Posing as a man of peace in his public speeches,
Hitler emphasized that Germany wished only to revise
the unfair provisions of Versailles by peaceful means and
achieve Germany’s rightful place among the European
states. On March 9, 1935, Hitler announced the creation
of a new air force and one week later the introduction of
a military draft that would expand Germany’s army
from 100,000 to 550,000 troops. This unilateral repudiation of the Versailles treaty brought a swift reaction as
France, Great Britain, and Italy condemned Germany’s
action and warned against future aggressive steps. But
no concrete actions were taken.
On March 7, 1936, buoyed by his conviction that the
Western democracies had no intention of using force to
maintain the Treaty of Versailles, Hitler sent German
troops into the demilitarized Rhineland. According to the
Versailles treaty, the French had the right to use force
against any violation of the demilitarized Rhineland. But
France would not act without British support, and the
British viewed the occupation of German territory by
German troops as a reasonable action by a dissatisfied
power. The London Times noted that the Germans were
only ‘‘going into their own back garden.’’
Meanwhile, Hitler gained new allies. In October
1935, Benito Mussolini had committed Fascist Italy to
imperial expansion by invading Ethiopia. Angered by
French and British opposition to his invasion, Mussolini
welcomed Hitler’s support and began to draw closer to
the German dictator he had once called a buffoon. In
October 1936, Mussolini and Hitler concluded an agreement that recognized their common political and economic interests, and one month later, Mussolini referred
publicly to the new Rome-Berlin Axis. Also in November,
Germany and Japan (the rising military power in the
East), concluded the Anti-Comintern Pact and agreed to
maintain a common front against communism. By the
beginning of 1937, Hitler and Nazi Germany had achieved
a ‘‘diplomatic revolution’’ in Europe. The Treaty of Versailles had been virtually scrapped, and Germany was once
again a ‘‘world power,’’ Hitler proclaimed.
The Path to War in Europe, 1938--1939
By the beginning of 1938, Hitler was convinced that
neither the French nor the British would provide much

opposition to his plans and decided to move on Austria.
By threatening Austria with invasion, Hitler coerced the
Austrian chancellor, Kurt von Schuschnigg (1897--1977),
into putting an Austrian Nazi in charge of the government. When German troops marched unopposed into
Austria on March 12, they did so on the ‘‘legal basis’’ of
the new Austrian chancellor’s request for German troops
to assist in establishing law and order. The next day, triumphantly returning to his native land, Hitler formally
annexed Austria to Germany. Great Britain’s swift acknowledgment of Hitler’s proclamation only increased
the German dictator’s contempt for Western weakness.
Czechoslovakia The annexation of Austria improved
Germany’s strategic position in central Europe and put
Germany in position for Hitler’s next objective---the destruction of Czechoslovakia (see Map 27.1). This goal
might have seemed unrealistic since democratic Czechoslovakia was quite prepared to defend itself and was well
supported by pacts with France and the Soviet Union.
Nevertheless, Hitler believed that France and Britain
would not use force to defend Czechoslovakia.
He was right again. When on September 15, 1938,
Hitler demanded the cession to Germany of the Sudetenland, the mountainous northwestern border area of
Czechoslovakia that was home to 3.5 million ethnic
Germans, and expressed his willingness to risk ‘‘world war’’ to
achieve his objective, the British,
French, Germans, and Italians---at a
hastily arranged conference at Munich---reached an agreement that
essentially met all of Hitler’s demands. German troops were allowed to occupy the Sudetenland as
the Czechs, abandoned by their
Western allies, stood by helplessly.
The Munich Conference was the
high point of Western appeasement
of Hitler. When Neville Chamberlain, the British prime minister, returned to England from Munich, he
boasted that the Munich agreement
meant ‘‘peace in our time.’’ Hitler
had promised Chamberlain that he
had made his last demand. Like
many German politicians, Chamberlain had believed Hitler’s assurances (see the box on p. 586).
In fact, Munich confirmed
Hitler’s perception that the Western
democracies were weak and would
not fight. Increasingly, Hitler was
convinced of his own infallibility, and he had by no
means been appeased at Munich. In March 1939, Hitler
occupied the Czech lands (Bohemia and Moravia), while
the Slovaks, with Hitler’s encouragement, declared their
independence of the Czechs and became a puppet state
(Slovakia) of Nazi Germany. On the evening of March 15,
1939, Hitler triumphantly declared in Prague that he
would be known as the greatest German of them all.
Poland At long last, the Western states reacted to
Hitler’s threat. Hitler’s naked aggression made clear that
his promises were utterly worthless. When Hitler began
to demand the return to Germany of Danzig (which had
been made a free city by the Treaty of Versailles to serve
as a seaport for Poland), Britain recognized the danger
and offered to protect Poland in the event of war. At the
same time, both France and Britain realized that only
the Soviet Union was powerful enough to help contain
Nazi aggression and began political and military negotiations with Joseph Stalin and the Soviets. The West’s
distrust of Soviet communism, however, made an alliance unlikely.
Meanwhile, Hitler pressed on in the belief that the
West would not really fight over Poland. To preclude an
alliance between the West and the Soviet Union, which
would create the danger of a two-front war, Hitler, ever
the opportunist, negotiated his own nonaggression pact
with Stalin and shocked the world with its announcement
on August 23, 1939. The treaty with the Soviet Union
gave Hitler the freedom to attack Poland. He told his
generals, ‘‘Now Poland is in the position in which I
wanted her. . . . I am only afraid that at the last moment
some swine or other will yet submit to me a plan for
mediation.’’2 He need not have worried. On September 1,
German forces invaded Poland; two days later, Britain
and France declared war on Germany. Europe was again
at war.
The Path to War in Asia
The war in Asia arose from the ambitions of Japan, whose
rise to the status of world power had been swift. Economic crises in the 1930s had stifled the growth of democracy and allowed right-wing militant elements
connected with the government and the armed forces to
control Japanese politics and push a program of expansion. In September 1931, Japanese soldiers had seized
Manchuria, an area of northeastern China that had natural resources Japan needed. During the next several
years, Japan consolidated its hold on Manchuria, which it
renamed Manchukuo, and then began to expand its
control in North China. As Japan moved steadily southward, popular protests in Chinese cities against Japanese
aggression intensified. In July 1937, a clash between
Chinese and Japanese forces broke out at Marco Polo
Bridge, south of Beijing, and hostilities spread. The Japanese advanced up the Yangtze valley and seized the
Chinese capital of Nanjing, raping and killing thousands
of innocent civilians in the process. But the Chinese
Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek refused to capitulate
and moved his government upriver to Hankou. Japanese
strategists had hoped to force Chiang to join a Japanesedominated new order in East Asia, consisting of Japan,
Manchuria, and China. This aim was part of a larger plan
to seize Soviet Siberia with its rich resources and create a
new power structure in Asia, in which Japan would guide
its Asian neighbors on the path to development and
prosperity.
During the late 1930s, Japan began to cooperate with
Nazi Germany on the assumption that the two countries
would ultimately launch a joint attack on the Soviet
Union and divide its resources between them. But when
Germany surprised the world by signing a nonaggression
pact with the Soviets in August 1939, Japanese strategists
were compelled to reevaluate their long-term objectives.
Japan was not strong enough to defeat the Soviet Union
alone, so the Japanese began to shift their gaze southward
to the vast resources of Southeast Asia---the oil of the
Dutch East Indies, the rubber and tin of Malaya, and the
rice of Burma and Indochina.
A move southward, of course, would risk war with
the European colonial powers, especially Britain and
France, as well as with the other rising power in the
Pacific, the United States. When the Japanese occupied
Indochina in July 1941, the Americans responded by
cutting off sales of vital scrap iron and oil to Japan.
Japan’s military leaders decided to preempt any further
American response by attacking the American naval fleet
in the Pacific.
The Course of World War II
Q Focus Question: What were the main events of World
War II in Europe and in Asia, and why were the Allies
ultimately victorious?
Unleashing an early form of Blitzkrieg, or ‘‘lightning war,’’
Hitler stunned Europe with the speed and efficiency of
the German attack. Moving into Poland with about
1.5 million troops on two fronts, German forces used
armored columns or panzer divisions (a panzer division
was a strike force of about three hundred tanks and accompanying forces and supplies) supported by airplanes
to break quickly through Polish lines and encircle the
outnumbered and poorly equipped Polish armies. The
coordination of air and ground assaults included use of
Stuka dive bombers, which, with their sirens emitting a
blood-curdling shriek as they descended from the skies,
added a frighteningly destructive element to the German
attack. Regular infantry units, still on foot with their
supplies drawn by horses, then marched in to hold the
newly conquered territory. Soon after, Soviet military
forces attacked eastern Poland. Within four weeks, Poland
had surrendered. On September 28, 1939, Germany and
the Soviet Union officially divided Poland between them.
Victory and Stalemate
Although Hitler’s hopes to avoid warfare with the West
were dashed when France and Britain declared war on
September 3, he was confident that he could control the
situation. After a winter of waiting (called the ‘‘phony
war’’), Hitler resumed the fight on April 9, 1940, with
another Blitzkrieg, this time against Denmark and Norway. One month later, on May 10, the Germans launched
their attack on the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. The
main assault through Luxembourg and the Ardennes
forest was completely unexpected by the French and
British forces. German panzer divisions broke through the
weak French defensive positions there and raced across
northern France, splitting the Allied armies and trapping
French troops and the entire British army on the beaches
of Dunkirk. Only by heroic efforts did the British succeed
in achieving an evacuation of 330,000 Allied (mostly
British) troops. The French surrendered on June 22.
German armies occupied about three-fifths of France
while the French hero of World War I, Marshal Henri
Pe´tain (1856--1951), established an authoritarian regime
(known as Vichy France) over the remainder. Germany
was now in control of western and central Europe, but
Britain had still not been defeated.
The Problem of Britain As Hitler realized, an amphibious invasion of Britain would be possible only if
Germany gained control of the air. At the beginning of
August 1940, the Luftwaffe (the German air force)
launched a major offensive against British air and naval
bases, harbors, communication centers, and war industries. Led by the stubbornly determined Winston
Churchill, now prime minister of Britain, the British
fought back doggedly, supported by an effective radar
system that gave them early warning of German attacks.
Nevertheless, the British air force suffered critical losses
by the end of August and was probably saved by Hitler’s
change of strategy. In September, in retaliation for a
British attack on Berlin, Hitler ordered a shift from military targets to massive bombing of British cities to break
British morale. The British rebuilt their air strength
quickly and were soon inflicting major losses on Luftwaffe
bombers. By the end of September, Germany had lost the
Battle of Britain, and the invasion of the island nation had
to be postponed.
At this point, Hitler pursued the possibility of a
Mediterranean strategy, which would involve capturing
Egypt and the Suez Canal and closing the Mediterranean
to British ships, thereby shutting off Britain’s supply of
oil. Hitler’s commitment to the Mediterranean was never
wholehearted, however. His initial plan was to let the
Italians defeat the British in North Africa, but this strategy failed when the British routed the Italian army. Although Hitler then sent German troops to the North
African theater of war, his primary concern lay elsewhere;
he had already reached the decision to fulfill his lifelong
obsession with the acquisition of territory in the east.
Invasion of the Soviet Union Although he had no desire for a two-front war, Hitler became convinced that
Britain was remaining in the war only because it expected
Russian support. If Russia were smashed, Britain’s last
hope would be eliminated. Moreover, Hitler had convinced himself that the Soviet Union, with its JewishBolshevik leadership and a pitiful army, could be defeated
quickly and decisively. Although the invasion of the Soviet Union was scheduled for spring 1941, the attack was
delayed because of problems in the Balkans. Hitler had
already obtained the political cooperation of Hungary,
Bulgaria, and Romania, but Mussolini’s disastrous invasion of Greece in October 1940 exposed Hitler’s southern
flank to British air bases in Greece. To secure his Balkan
position, German troops seized both Yugoslavia and
Greece in April. Now reassured, Hitler turned to the east
and invaded the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, in the
belief that the Russians could still be decisively defeated
before winter arrived.
The massive attack stretched out along an 1,800-mile
front (see Map 27.2). German troops advanced rapidly,
capturing two million Russian soldiers. By November, one
German army group had swept through the Ukraine while
a second was besieging Leningrad; a third approached
within 25 miles of Moscow, the Russian capital. An early
winter and unexpected Soviet resistance, however, brought
the German advance to a halt. Armor and transport vehicles were stalled by temperatures of 30 below zero.
Hitler’s commanders wished to withdraw and regroup for
the following spring. Hitler refused. He insisted on no
retreat, fearing disintegration of his lines. A Soviet counterattack in December 1941 by an army supposedly exhausted by Nazi victories came as an ominous ending to
the year. Although the Germans managed to hold on and
reestablish their lines, a war diary from Panzer Group
Three described their desperate situation: ‘‘Discipline is
breaking down. More and more soldiers are heading west
on foot without weapons. . . . The road is under constant
air attack. Those killed by bombs are no longer being
buried. All the hangers-on (cargo troops, Luftwaffe,
supply trains) are pouring to the rear in full flight.’’3 By
December 1941, another of Hitler’s decisions---the declaration of war on the United States---had probably made
Hitler’s defeat inevitable and again turned a European
conflict into a global war.
The War in Asia
On December 7, 1941, Japanese carrier-based aircraft attacked the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor in the
Hawaiian Islands. The same day, other units launched
additional assaults on the Philippines and began advancing toward the British colony of Malaya. Shortly after,
Japanese forces invaded the Dutch East Indies and occupied a number of islands in the Pacific Ocean (see
Map 27.3). In some cases, as on the Bataan peninsula and
the island of Corregidor in the Philippines, resistance was
fierce, but by the spring of 1942, almost all of Southeast
Asia and much of the western Pacific had fallen into
Japanese hands. Tokyo declared the creation of the Greater
East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, encompassing the entire
region under Japanese tutelage, and announced its intention to liberate the colonial areas of Southeast Asia
from Western colonial rule. For the moment, however,
Japan needed the resources of the region for its war machine and placed the countries under its rule on a wartime
basis.
Japanese leaders had hoped that their strike at
American bases would destroy the U.S. Pacific Fleet and
persuade the Roosevelt administration to accept Japanese
domination of the Pacific. The American people, in the
eyes of Japanese leaders, had been made soft by material
indulgence. But Tokyo had miscalculated. The attack on
Pearl Harbor galvanized American opinion and won broad
support for Roosevelt’s war policy. The United States now
joined with European nations and Nationalist China in a
combined effort to defeat Japan and bring to an end its
hegemony in the Pacific.
The Turning Point of the War, 1942--1943
The entry of the United States into the war created a
coalition (the Grand Alliance) that ultimately defeated the
Axis powers (Germany, Italy, Japan). Nevertheless, the
three major Allies---Britain, the United States, and the
Soviet Union---had to overcome mutual suspicions before
they could operate as an effective team. Two factors aided
that process. First, Hitler’s declaration of war on the
United States made it easier for the United States to accept the British and Russian contention that the defeat of
Germany should be the Americans’ first priority. For that
reason, the United States increased the quantity of trucks,
planes, and other arms that it sent to the British and the
Soviets. Also important to the alliance was the tacit
agreement of the three chief Allies to stress military operations while ignoring political differences. At the beginning of 1943, the Allies agreed to fight until the Axis
powers surrendered unconditionally. This principle of
unconditional surrender had the effect of cementing the
Grand Alliance by making it nearly impossible for Hitler
to divide his foes.
Defeat was far from Hitler’s mind at the beginning of
1942, however. As Japanese forces advanced into Southeast
Asia and the Pacific, Hitler and his European allies continued the war in Europe against Britain and the Soviet
Union. Until the fall of 1942, it appeared that the Germans
might still prevail on the battlefield. Reinforcements in
North Africa enabled the Afrika Korps under General
Erwin Rommel to break through the British defenses in
Egypt and advance toward Alexandria. In the spring of
1942, a renewed German offensive in Russia led to the
capture of the entire Crimea, causing Hitler to boast in
August 1942:
As the next step, we are going to advance south of the Caucasus and then help the rebels in Iran and Iraq against the
English. Another thrust will be directed along the Caspian
Sea toward Afghanistan and India. Then the English will run
out of oil. In two years we’ll be on the borders of India.
Twenty to thirty elite German divisions will do. Then the
British Empire will collapse.4
But this would be Hitler’s last optimistic outburst. By the
fall of 1942, the war had turned against the Germans.
In North Africa, British forces had stopped Rommel’s
troops at El Alamein in the summer of 1942 and then
forced them back across the desert. In November 1942,
British and American forces invaded French North Africa
and forced the German and Italian troops to surrender in
May 1943. On the Eastern Front, the turning point of the
war occurred at Stalingrad. After the capture of the
Crimea, Hitler’s generals wanted him to concentrate on
the Caucasus and its oil fields, but Hitler decided that
Stalingrad, a major industrial center on the Volga, should
be taken first. Between November 1942 and February 1943,
German troops were stopped, then encircled, and finally
forced to surrender on February 2, 1943 (see the box on
p. 592). The entire German Sixth Army of 300,000 men
was lost. By February 1943, German forces in Russia were
back to their positions of June 1942.
The tide of battle in the East also turned dramatically
in 1942. In the Battle of the Coral Sea on May 7--8, 1942,
American naval forces stopped the Japanese advance and
temporarily relieved Australia of the threat of invasion. On
June 4, at the Battle of Midway Island, American planes
destroyed all four of the attacking Japanese aircraft carriers
and established American naval superiority in the Pacific.
The victory was especially remarkable in that almost all
the American planes were shot down in the encounter. By
the fall of 1942, Allied forces were beginning to gather for
offensive operations into South China from Burma,
through the Indonesian islands by a process of ‘‘island
hopping’’ by troops commanded by the American general
Douglas MacArthur, and across the Pacific with a combination of U.S. Army, Marine, and Navy attacks on
Japanese-held islands. After a series of bitter engagements
in the waters off the Solomon Islands from August to
November 1942, Japanese fortunes began to fade.
The Last Years of the War
By the beginning of 1943, the tide of battle had turned
against Germany, Italy, and Japan. After the Axis forces had
surrendered in Tunisia on May 13, 1943, the Allies crossed
the Mediterranean and carried the war to Italy. After
taking Sicily, Allied troops began the invasion of mainland
Italy in September. In the meantime, after the ouster and
arrest of Benito Mussolini, a new Italian government offered to surrender to Allied forces. But Mussolini was
liberated by the Germans in a daring raid and then set up
as the head of a puppet German state in northern Italy
while German troops moved in and occupied much of
Italy. The new defensive lines established by the Germans
in the hills south of Rome were so effective that the Allied
advance up the Italian peninsula was a painstaking affair
accompanied by heavy casualties. Rome did not fall to the
Allies until June 4, 1944. By that time, the Italian war had
assumed a secondary role anyway as the Allies opened their
long-awaited ‘‘second front’’ in western Europe.
Allied Advances in the West Since the autumn of
1943, the Allies had been planning a cross-channel invasion of France from Britain. On June 6, 1944, under the
direction of the American general Dwight D. Eisenhower
(1890--1969), the Allies landed five assault divisions on
the beaches of Normandy in history’s greatest amphibious invasion. The Germans’ initially indecisive response
enabled the Allied forces to establish a beachhead. Within
three months, they had landed two million men and a
half-million vehicles that pushed inland and broke
through German defensive lines.
After the breakout, Allied troops moved south and
east and liberated Paris by the end of August. By March
1945, they had crossed the Rhine River and advanced
farther into Germany. At the end of April, Allied forces in
northern Germany moved toward the Elbe River, where
they finally linked up with the Soviets.
Soviet Offensive in the East The Soviets had come a
long way since the Battle of Stalingrad in 1943. In the
summer of 1943, Hitler gambled on taking the offensive
by making use of newly developed heavy tanks. German
forces were soundly defeated by the Russians at the Battle
of Kursk (July 5--12), the greatest tank battle of the war.
Soviet forces now began a relentless advance westward.
The Soviets had reoccupied the Ukraine by the end of
1943 and lifted the siege of Leningrad and moved into
the Baltic States by the beginning of 1944. Advancing
along a northern front, Soviet troops occupied Warsaw
in January 1945 and entered Berlin in April. Meanwhile,
Soviet troops swept along a southern front through
Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria.
In January 1945, Hitler had moved into a bunker 55
feet under Berlin to direct the final stages of the war. In
his last political testament, Hitler, consistent to the end in
his rabid anti-Semitism, blamed the Jews for the war:
‘‘Above all I charge the leaders of the nation and those
under them to scrupulous observance of the laws of race
and to merciless opposition to the universal poisoner of
all peoples, international Jewry.’’5 Hitler committed suicide in his bunker on April 30, two days after Mussolini
had been shot by partisan Italian forces. On May 7,
German commanders surrendered. The war in Europe
was over.
The war in Asia continued. Beginning in 1943, American
forces had gone on the offensive and advanced, slowly at
times, across the Pacific. The Americans took an increasing
toll of enemy resources, especially at sea and in the air.
President Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945, and was succeeded by his vice president, Harry Truman. When Truman and his advisers became convinced that American
troops might suffer heavy casualties in an invasion of the
Japanese homeland, they made the decision to drop the
newly developed atomic bomb on the Japanese cities of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The resulting devastation was
horrific; the Japanese surrendered unconditionally on
August 14. World War II was finally over.
The New Order
Q Focus Questions: How was the Nazi empire organized?
What was the Holocaust, and what role did it play in
Nazi policy?
The initial victories of the Germans and the Japanese gave
them the opportunity to create new orders in Europe and
Asia. Although both countries presented positive images
of these new orders for publicity
purposes, in practice both followed
policies of ruthless domination of
their subject peoples.
The Nazi Empire
After the German victories in
Europe between 1939 and 1941,
Nazi propagandists painted glowing
images of a new European order
based on ‘‘equal chances’’ for all nations and an integrated economic
community. This was not Hitler’s
conception of a European New Order. He saw the Europe he had conquered simply as subject to German
domination. Only the Germans,
he once said, ‘‘can really organize
Europe.’’
The Nazi empire stretched across
continental Europe from the English Channel in the west to the
outskirts of Moscow in the east.

In no way was this empire structured systematically or
governed efficiently. Nazi-occupied Europe was organized
in one of two ways. Some areas, such as western Poland,
were annexed and made into German provinces. Most of
occupied Europe was administered by German military or
civilian officials, combined with different degrees of indirect control from collaborationist regimes.
Racial considerations played an important role in
how conquered peoples were treated in the Nazi New
Order. German civil administrations were established in
Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands because the Nazis
considered these populations Aryan, racially akin to the
Germans and hence worthy of more lenient treatment.
‘‘Inferior’’ Latin peoples, such as the occupied French,
were given military administrations. By 1943, however, as
Nazi losses continued to mount, all the occupied territories of northern and western Europe were ruthlessly exploited for material goods and manpower for Germany’s
war needs.
Plans for an Aryan Racial Empire Because the conquered lands in the east contained the living space for
German expansion and were populated in Nazi eyes by
racially inferior Slavic peoples, Nazi administration there
was considerably more ruthless. Hitler’s racial ideology
and his plans for an Aryan racial empire were so important
to him that he and the Nazis began to implement their
racial program soon after the conquest of Poland. Heinrich
Himmler, a strong believer in Nazi racial ideology and the
leader of the SS, was put in charge of German resettlement
plans in the east. Himmler’s task was to evacuate the inferior Slavic peoples and replace them with Germans, a
policy first applied to the new German provinces created
from the lands of western Poland. One million Poles were
uprooted and dumped in southern Poland. Hundreds of
thousands of ethnic Germans (descendants of Germans
who had migrated years earlier from Germany to different
parts of southern and eastern Europe) were encouraged to
colonize the designated areas in Poland. By 1942, two
million ethnic Germans had been settled in Poland.
The invasion of the Soviet Union inflated Nazi visions of German colonization in the east. Hitler spoke to
his intimate circle of a colossal project of social engineering after the war, in which Poles, Ukrainians, and
Russians would become slave labor while German peasants settled on the abandoned lands and Germanized
them. Nazis involved in this kind of planning were well
aware of the human costs. Himmler told a gathering of SS
officers that although the destruction of thirty million
Slavs was a prerequisite for German plans in the east,
‘‘whether nations live in prosperity or starve to death
interests me only insofar as we need them as slaves for our
culture. Otherwise it is of no interest.’’6
Use of Foreign Workers Labor shortages in Germany
led to a policy of ruthless mobilization of foreign labor. In
1942, a special office was created to recruit labor for
German farms and industries. By the summer of 1944,
seven million foreign workers were laboring in Germany
and constituted 20 percent of Germany’s labor force. At
the same time, another seven million workers were supplying forced labor in their own countries on farms, in
industries, and in military camps. Forced labor often
proved counterproductive, however, because the brutal
character of Germany’s recruitment policies often led more
and more people to resist the Nazi occupation forces.
The Holocaust
There was no more terrifying aspect of the Nazi New
Order than the deliberate attempt to exterminate the Jews
of Europe. Racial struggle was a key element in Hitler’s
ideology and meant to him a clearly defined conflict of
opposites: the Aryans, creators of human cultural development, against the Jews, parasites who were trying to
destroy the Aryans. By the beginning of 1939, Nazi policy
focused on promoting the ‘‘emigration’’ of German Jews
from Germany. Once the war began in September 1939,
however, the so-called Jewish problem took on new dimensions. For a while, there was discussion of the Madagascar plan, which aspired to ship Jews en masse to the
African island of Madagascar. When war contingencies
made this plan impractical, an even more drastic policy
was conceived.
The SS and the Einsatzgruppen Heinrich Himmler and
the SS organization shared Adolf Hitler’s racial ideology.
The SS was given responsibility for what the Nazis called
their Final Solution to the Jewish problem, the annihilation
of the Jews. Reinhard Heydrich (1904--1942), head of the
SS’s Security Service, was given administrative responsibility
for the Final Solution. After the defeat of Poland, Heydrich
ordered the special strike forces (Einsatzgruppen) that he
had created to round up all Polish Jews and concentrate
them in ghettos established in a number of Polish cities.
In June 1941, the Einsatzgruppen were given new responsibilities as mobile killing units. These SS death
squads followed the regular army’s advance into Russia.
Their job was to round up Jews in their villages and execute and bury them in mass graves, often giant pits dug by
the victims themselves before they were shot. Such regular
killing produced morale problems among the SS executioners. During a visit to Minsk in the Soviet Union, SS
leader Himmler tried to build morale by pointing out that
he would not like it if Germans did such a thing gladly.
But their conscience was in no way impaired, for they were
soldiers who had to carry out every order unconditionally.
He alone had responsibility before God and Hitler for everything that was happening, . . . and he was acting from a deep
understanding of the necessity for this operation.7
The Death Camps Although it has been estimated that
as many as one million Jews were killed by the Einsatzgruppen, this approach to solving the Jewish problem was
soon perceived as inadequate. Instead, the Nazis opted for
the systematic annihilation of the European Jewish population in specially built death camps. The plan was
simple. Jews from countries occupied by Germany or
sympathetic to Germany would be rounded up, packed
like cattle into freight trains, and shipped to Poland,
where six extermination centers were built for this purpose (see Map 27.4). The largest and most infamous was
Auschwitz-Birkenau. Medical technicians chose Zyklon B
(the commercial name for hydrogen cyanide) as the most
effective gas for quickly killing large numbers of people in
gas chambers designed to look like ‘‘shower rooms’’ to
facilitate the cooperation of the victims. After gassing, the
corpses would be burned in specially built crematoria.
By the spring of 1942, the death camps were in operation. Although initial priority was given to the elimination of the ghettos in Poland, by the summer of 1942,
Jews were also being shipped from France, Belgium, and
the Netherlands. Even as the Allies were making important advances in 1944, Jews were being shipped from
Greece and Hungary. These shipments depended on the
cooperation of Germany’s Transport Ministry, and despite desperate military needs, the Final Solution had
priority in using railroad cars for the transportation of
Jews to death camps.
A harrowing experience awaited the Jews when they
arrived at one of the six death camps. Rudolf Ho¨ss,
commandant at Auschwitz-Birkenau, described it:
We had two SS doctors on duty at Auschwitz to examine the
incoming transports of prisoners. The prisoners would be
marched by one of the doctors who would make spot decisions as they walked by. Those who were fit for work were
sent into the camp. Others were sent immediately to the extermination plants. Children of tender years were invariably
exterminated since by reason of their youth they were unable
to work. . . . At Auschwitz we endeavored to fool the victims
into thinking that they were to go through a delousing process. Of course, frequently they realized our true intentions
and we sometimes had riots and difficulties due to that fact.8
About 30 percent of the arrivals at Auschwitz were sent to
a labor camp; the remainder went to the gas chambers
(see the box on p. 597). After they had been gassed, the
bodies were burned in the crematoria. The victims’ goods
and even their bodies were used for economic gain.
Women’s hair was cut off, collected, and turned into
mattresses or cloth. Some inmates were also subjected to
cruel and painful ‘‘medical’’ experiments. The Germans
killed between five and six million Jews, more than three
million of them in the death camps. Virtually 90 percent
of the Jewish populations of Poland, the Baltic countries,
and Germany were exterminated. Overall, the Holocaust
was responsible for the death of nearly two out of every
three European Jews.
The Other Holocaust The Nazis were also responsible
for the deliberate death by shooting, starvation, or overwork of at least another nine to ten million people. Because the Nazis also considered the Gypsies of Europe
(like the Jews) a race containing alien blood, they were
systematically rounded up for extermination. About
40 percent of Europe’s one million Gypsies were killed in
the death camps. The leading elements of the ‘‘subhuman’’ Slavic peoples---the clergy, intelligentsia, civil leaders, judges, and lawyers---were arrested and murdered.
Probably an additional four million Poles, Ukrainians,
and White Russians lost their lives as slave laborers for
Nazi Germany, and three to four million Soviet prisoners
of war were killed in captivity. The Nazis also singled out
homosexuals for persecution, and thousands lost their
lives in concentration camps.
The New Order in Asia
Once Japan’s takeover was completed, Japanese war
policy in the occupied areas in Asia became essentially
defensive, as Japan hoped to use
its new possessions to meet its
needs for raw materials, such as
tin, oil, and rubber, as well as to
serve as an outlet for Japanese
manufactured goods. To provide
a structure for the arrangement,
Japanese leaders set up the Greater
East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere as
a self-sufficient community designed to provide mutual benefits
to the occupied areas and the
home country.
The Japanese conquest of
Southeast Asia had been accomplished under the slogan ‘‘Asia for
the Asians.’’ Japanese officials in
occupied territories promised that
independent government would
be established under Japanese tutelage. Such governments were
eventually established in Burma,
the Dutch East Indies, Vietnam,
and the Philippines.
In fact, however, real power
rested with Japanese military authorities in each territory, and the
local Japanese military command
was directly subordinated to the
army general staff in Tokyo. The
economic resources of the colonies
were exploited for the benefit of
the Japanese war machine, while
natives were recruited to serve in
local military units or were conscripted to work on public works
projects. In some cases, the people
living in the occupied areas were
subjected to severe hardships.
Like German soldiers in occupied Europe, Japanese military
forces often had little respect for
the lives of their subject peoples. In their conquest of
Nanjing, China, in 1937, Japanese soldiers had spent
several days killing, raping, and looting. Almost 800,000
Koreans were sent overseas, most of them as forced
laborers, to Japan. Tens of thousands of Korean women
were forced to serve as ‘‘comfort women’’ (prostitutes) for
Japanese troops. In construction projects to help their
war effort, the Japanese also made extensive use of labor
forces composed of both prisoners of war and local
peoples. In building the Burma-Thailand railway in 1943,
for example, the Japanese used 61,000 Australian, British,
nd Dutch prisoners of war and almost 300,000 workers
from Burma, Malaya, Thailand, and the Dutch East
Indies. An inadequate diet and appalling work conditions
in an unhealthy climate led to the death of 12,000 Allied
prisoners of war and 90,000 native workers by the time
the railway was completed.
The Home Front
Q Focus Question: What were conditions like on the
home front for Japan and the major Western nations
involved in World War II?
World War II was even more of a total war than World
War I. Fighting was much more widespread and covered
most of the globe. Economic mobilization was more extensive; so was the mobilization of women. The number
of civilians killed was far higher: almost twenty million
died as a result of bombing raids, mass extermination
policies, and attacks by invading armies.
The Mobilization of Peoples
The home fronts of the major belligerents varied considerably, based on national circumstances.
The Soviet Union World War II had an enormous
impact on the Soviet Union. Known to the Soviets as the
Great Patriotic War, the German-Soviet war witnessed the
greatest land battles in history as well as incredible
ruthlessness. Two out of every five persons killed in World
War II were Soviet citizens.
The Soviets’ initial defeats led to drastic emergency
mobilization measures that affected the civilian population. Leningrad, for example, spent nine hundred
days under siege, during which its inhabitants were so
desperate for food that they ate dogs, cats, and mice.
As the German army made its rapid advance into
Soviet territory, the factories in the western part of
the Soviet Union were dismantled and shipped to the
interior---to the Urals, western Siberia, and the Volga
regions. Machines were placed on the bare ground, and
walls went up around them as workers began factory
operations.
Stalin called this widespread military, industrial, and
economic mobilization a ‘‘battle of machines,’’ and the
Soviets won, producing 78,000 tanks and 98,000 artillery
pieces. Fifty-five percent of Soviet national income went
for war materials, compared to 15 percent in 1940. As a
result of the emphasis on military goods, Soviet citizens
experienced dire shortages of both food and housing.
Soviet women played a major role in the war effort.
Women and girls worked in industries, mines, and railroads. Overall, the number of women working in industry
increased almost 60 percent. Soviet women were also
expected to dig antitank ditches and work as air-raid
wardens. In addition, the Soviet Union was the only
country in World War II to use women as combatants.
Soviet women functioned as snipers and also as crews in
bomber squadrons. The female pilots who helped defeat the
Germans at Stalingrad were known as the ‘‘night witches.’’
The United States The home front in the United States
was quite different from those of the other major belligerents, largely because the United States faced no threat of
war on its own soil. Although the economy and labor
force were slow to mobilize, eventually the United States
became the arsenal of the Allied powers, producing the
military equipment they needed. During the high point of
war production in the United States in November 1943,
the country was constructing six ships a day and $6 billion
worth of war-related goods a month.
The mobilization of the American economy caused
social problems. The construction of new factories created
boomtowns where thousands came to work but then faced
a shortage of houses, health facilities, and schools. The
dramatic expansion of small towns into large cities often
brought a breakdown in traditional social mores, especially evident in the growth of teenage prostitution. Economic mobilization also led to a widespread movement of
people, which in turn created new social tensions. Sixteen
million men and women were enrolled in the military, and
another sixteen million, mostly wives and sweethearts of
the servicemen or workers looking for jobs, also relocated.
More than one million blacks migrated from the rural
South to the industrial cities of the North and West,
looking for jobs in industry. The presence of blacks in
areas where they had not lived before led to racial tensions
and sometimes even riots. In Detroit in June 1943, white
mobs roamed the streets attacking blacks.
Japanese Americans were treated even more shabbily. On the West Coast, 110,000 Japanese Americans,
65 percent of whom had been born in the United States,
were removed to inland camps encircled by barbed
wire and required to take loyalty oaths. Although public
officials claimed that this policy was necessary for security
reasons, no similar treatment of German Americans or
Italian Americans ever took place. The racism inherent in
this treatment of Japanese Americans was evident when
the California governor, Culbert Olson, said, ‘‘You know,
when I look out at a group of Americans of German or
Italian descent, I can tell whether they’re loyal or not. I
can tell how they think and even perhaps what they are
thinking. But it is impossible for me to do this with inscrutable orientals, and particularly the Japanese.’’9
Germany In August 1914, Germans had enthusiastically
cheered their soldiers marching off to war. In September
1939, the streets were quiet. Many Germans were apathetic
or, even worse for the Nazi regime, had a foreboding of
disaster. Hitler was very aware of the importance of the
home front. He believed that the collapse of the home
front in World War I had caused Germany’s defeat, and in
his determination to avoid a repetition of that experience,
he adopted economic policies that may have cost Germany
the war.
To maintain the morale of the home front during the
first two years of the war, Hitler refused to convert production from consumer goods to armaments. The Blitzkrieg allowed the Germans to win quick victories, after
which they could plunder the food and raw materials of
conquered countries in order to avoid diverting resources
away from the civilian economy. After the German defeats
on the Russian front and the American entry into the war,
the economic situation changed. Early in 1942, Hitler finally ordered a massive increase in armaments production
and the size of the army. Hitler’s personal architect, Albert
Speer, was made minister for armaments and munitions
in 1942. By eliminating waste and rationalizing procedures, Speer was able to triple the production of armaments between 1942 and 1943 despite the intense Allied
air raids. Speer’s urgent plea for a total mobilization of
resources for the war effort went unheeded, however.
Hitler, fearful of civilian morale problems that would
undermine the home front, refused any dramatic cuts in
the production of consumer goods. A total mobilization
of the economy was not implemented until July 1944,
when schools, theaters, and cafe´s were closed and Speer
was finally permitted to use all remaining resources for the
production of a few basic military items. But by that time,
it was too late to save Germany from defeat.
The war produced a reversal in Nazi attitudes toward
women. Nazi resistance to female employment declined as
the war progressed and more and more men were called up
for military service. Nazi magazines now proclaimed, ‘‘We
see the woman as the eternal mother of our people,
but also as the working and fighting comrade of the
man.’’10 But the number of women working in industry,
agriculture, commerce, and domestic service increased
only slightly. The total number of employed women in
September 1944 was 14.9 million, compared to 14.6 million in May 1939. Many women, especially those of the
middle class, resisted regular employment, particularly in
factories.
Japan Wartime Japan was a highly mobilized society. To
guarantee its control over all national resources, the
government set up a planning board to control prices,
wages, the utilization of labor, and the allocation of resources. Traditional habits of obedience and hierarchy,
buttressed by the concept of imperial divinity, were emphasized to encourage citizens to sacrifice their resources,
and sometimes their lives, for the national cause. Especially important was the code of bushido, or the way of the
warrior, the old code of morality of the samurai, who had
played a prominent military role in medieval and early
modern Japanese history. The code of bushido was revived
during the nationalistic fervor of the 1930s. Based on an
ideal of loyalty and service, the code emphasized the
obligation to honor and defend emperor, country, and
family and to sacrifice one’s life if one failed in this sacred
mission. The system culminated in the final years of the
war, when young Japanese were encouraged to volunteer
en masse to serve as pilots in the suicide missions (known
as kamikaze, ‘‘divine wind’’) against U.S. battleships.
Women’s rights, too, were to be sacrificed to the
greater national cause. Already by 1937, Japanese women
were being exhorted to fulfill their patriotic duty by
bearing more children and by espousing the slogans of the
Greater Japanese Women’s Association. However, Japan
was extremely reluctant to mobilize women on behalf of
Japan’s war effort. Female employment increased during
the war, but only in areas where women traditionally
worked, such as the textile industry and farming. Instead
of using women to meet labor shortages, the Japanese
government brought in Korean and Chinese laborers.
Civilians on the Front Line:
The Bombing of Cities
Bombing was used in World War II in a variety of ways:
against nonhuman military targets, against enemy troops,
and against civilian populations. These last made World
War II as devastating for civilians as for frontline soldiers
(see the box above). A small number of bombing raids in
the last year of World War I had given rise to the argument
that the public outcry generated by the bombing of civilian populations would be an effective way to coerce
governments into making peace. Consequently, European
air forces began to develop long-range bombers in the
1930s.
Luftwaffe Attacks The first sustained use of civilian
bombing contradicted this theory. Beginning in early
September 1940, the German Luftwaffe subjected London
and many other British cities and towns to nightly air
raids, making the Blitz (as the British called the German
air raids) a national experience. Londoners took the first
heavy blows and set the standard for the rest of the British
population by refusing to panic. But London morale was
helped by the fact that German raids were widely scattered over a very large city. Smaller communities were
more directly affected by the devastation. On November
14, 1940, for example, the Luftwaffe destroyed hundreds
of shops and 100 acres of the city center of Coventry.
Morale sank as wild rumors of heavy casualties spread in
these communities but soon rebounded.
The Bombing of Germany The British failed to learn
from their own experience, however, and soon began
bombing Germany. Churchill and his advisers believed
that destroying German communities would break civilian morale and bring victory. Major bombing raids began
in 1942 under the direction of Arthur Harris, the wartime
leader of the British air force’s Bomber Command, which
was rearmed with four-engine heavy bombers capable of
taking the war into the center of occupied Europe. On
May 31, 1942, Cologne became the first German city to be
subjected to an attack by one thousand bombers.
With the entry of the Americans into the war, bombing
strategy changed. American planes flew daytime missions
aimed at the precision bombing of transportation facilities and wartime industries, while the British Bomber
Command continued nighttime saturation bombing of all
German cities with populations over 100,000. Bombing
raids added an element of terror to circumstances already
made difficult by growing shortages of food, clothing, and
fuel. Germans especially feared incendiary bombs, which
set off firestorms that swept destructive paths through the
cities. Four raids on Hamburg in August 1943 produced
temperatures of 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit, obliterated half
the city’s buildings, and killed thousands of civilians. The
ferocious bombing of Dresden on February 13--15, 1945,
created a firestorm that may have killed as many as 35,000
inhabitants and refugees.
Germany suffered enormously from the Allied bombing raids. Millions of buildings were destroyed, and
possibly half a million civilians died in the raids. Nevertheless, it is highly unlikely that Allied bombing sapped
the morale of the German people. Instead, Germans,
whether pro- or anti-Nazi, fought
on stubbornly, often driven simply
by a desire to live. Nor did the
bombing destroy Germany’s industrial capacity. The Allied Strategic Bombing survey revealed
that the production of war materials actually increased between
1942 and 1944. Even in 1944 and
1945, Allied raids cut German
production of armaments by only
7 percent.
Because of strong German air
defenses, air raids were also costly
for the Allies. Nearly 40,000 Allied
planes were destroyed, and 160,000
airmen lost their lives.
The Bombing of Japan: The
Atomic Bomb The bombing of
civilians reached a horrific new
level with the dropping of the first
atomic bomb. Japan was especially
vulnerable to air raids because its
air force had been virtually destroyed in the course of the war
and its crowded cities were built of flimsy materials. Attacks on Japanese cities by the new American B-29 Superfortresses, the biggest bombers of the war, had begun
on November 24, 1944. By the summer of 1945, many of
Japan’s factories had been destroyed along with onefourth of its dwellings. After the Japanese government
decreed the mobilization of all people between the ages of
thirteen and sixty into the People’s Volunteer Corps,
President Truman and his advisers feared that Japanese
fanaticism might mean a million American casualties.
This concern led them to drop the newly perfected atomic
bomb on Hiroshima (August 6) and Nagasaki (August 9).
The destruction was incredible. Of 76,000 buildings near
the center of the explosion in Hiroshima, only 6,000 remained standing, and 140,000 of the city’s 400,000 inhabitants had died by the end of 1945. Another 50,000
perished from the effects of radiation over the next
five years.
Aftermath of the War
Q Focus Questions: What were the costs of World War II?
How did the Allies’ visions of postwar Europe differ,
and how did these differences contribute to the
emergence of the Cold War?
World War II was the most destructive war in history.
Much had been at stake. Nazi Germany pursued a
worldview based on racial extermination and the enslavement of millions in order to create an ‘‘Aryan empire.’’ The Japanese, fueled by extreme nationalist ideals,
also harbored dreams of empire in Asia that led to mass
murder and untold devastation. Fighting the Axis powers
in World War II required the mobilization of millions of
ordinary men and women in the Allied countries who
rose to the occasion and struggled to preserve a different
way of life. As Winston Churchill once put it, ‘‘War is
horrible, but slavery is worse.’’
The Costs of World War II
The costs of World War II were enormous. At least 21
million soldiers died. Civilian deaths were even greater
and are now estimated at around 40 million, of whom
more than 28 million were Russian and Chinese. The
Soviet Union experienced the greatest losses: 10 million
soldiers and 19 million civilians. In 1945, millions of
people around the world faced starvation; in Europe, 100
million people depended on food relief of some kind.
Millions of people had also been uprooted by the war
and became ‘‘displaced persons.’’ Europe alone may have
had 30 million displaced persons, many of whom found it
hard to return home. After the war, millions of Germans
were expelled from the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia
and millions more from former eastern German territories turned over to Poland, all of which seemed reasonable
to people who had suffered so much at the hands of the
Germans. In Asia, millions of Japanese were returned
from the former Japanese empire to Japan, while thousands of Korean forced laborers returned to Korea.
Everywhere cities lay in ruins. Physical devastation
was especially severe in eastern and southeastern Europe
and in the cities of western and central Europe. In Asia,
China also experienced extensive devastation from eight
years of conflict. At the same time, millions of tons of
shipping were now underneath the seas; factories, farms,
and transportation systems, bridges, dams, and farms lay
in ruins. The total cost of the war has been estimated at
$4 trillion, while the economies of most belligerents, with
the exception of the United States, were drained and on
the brink of disaster.
Allied War Conferences
The total victory of the Allies in World War II was followed not by peace but by a new conflict known as the
Cold War that dominated world politics until the end of
the 1980s. The Cold War grew out of military, political,
and ideological differences, especially between the Soviet
Union and the United States, that became apparent
during the last years of the war. Although Allied leaders
were preoccupied primarily with ending the war, they
were also strongly motivated by differing and often
conflicting visions of postwar Europe.
The Tehran Conference Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill, the leaders of the Big Three powers of the Grand Alliance, met at Tehran, the capital of Iran, in November
1943 to decide the future course of the war. Their major
tactical decision concerned the final assault on Germany.
Stalin and Roosevelt argued successfully for an AmericanBritish invasion of the Continent through France, which
they scheduled for the spring of 1944. The acceptance of
this plan had important consequences. It meant that
Soviet and British-American forces would meet in defeated Germany along a north-south dividing line and
that eastern Europe would most likely be liberated by
Soviet forces. The Allies also agreed to an administrative
partition of postwar Germany.
The Yalta Conference By the time of the conference at
Yalta, in the Soviet republic of the Ukraine, in February
1945, the defeat of Germany was a foregone conclusion.
The Western powers, which had earlier believed that the
Soviets were in a weak position, now faced the reality of
eleven million Red Army soldiers taking possession of
eastern and much of central Europe. Stalin was still operating under the notion of spheres of influence. He was
deeply suspicious of the Western powers and desired a
buffer to protect the Soviet Union from possible future
Western aggression. At the same time, however, Stalin was
eager to obtain economically important resources and
strategic military positions. Roosevelt by this time was
moving away from the notion of spheres of influence to
the ideal of self-determination. He called for ‘‘the end of
the system of unilateral action, exclusive alliances, and
spheres of influence.’’ The Grand Alliance approved the
Declaration on Liberated Europe. This was a pledge to
assist liberated European nations in the creation of
‘‘democratic institutions of their own choice.’’ Liberated
countries were to hold free elections to determine their
political systems.
At Yalta, Roosevelt sought Soviet military help against
Japan. The atomic bomb was not yet assured, and
American military planners feared the possible loss of as
many as one million men in amphibious assaults on the
Japanese home islands. Roosevelt therefore agreed to
Stalin’s price for military assistance against Japan: possession of Sakhalin and the Kurile Islands, as well as two
warm-water ports and railroad rights in Manchuria.
The creation of the United Nations was a major
American concern at Yalta. Roosevelt hoped to ensure the
participation of the Big Three powers in a postwar international organization before difficult issues divided
them into hostile camps. After a number of compromises,
both Churchill and Stalin accepted Roosevelt’s plans for a
United Nations organization and set the first meeting for
San Francisco in April 1945.
The issues of Germany and eastern Europe were
treated less decisively. The Big Three reaffirmed that
Germany must surrender unconditionally and created
four occupation zones (see Map 27.5). German reparations were set at $20 billion. A compromise was also
worked out in regard to Poland. Stalin agreed to free
elections in the future to determine a new government.
But the issue of free elections in eastern Europe caused a
serious rift between the Soviets and the Americans. The
principle was that eastern European governments would
be freely elected, but they were also supposed to be proSoviet. This attempt to reconcile two irreconcilable goals
was doomed to failure, as soon became evident at the
next conference of the Big Three powers.
Even as the war was ending, Western relations with
the Soviets were deteriorating rapidly. The Grand Alliance
had been one of necessity in which disagreements had
been subordinated to the pragmatic concerns of the war.
The Allied powers’ only common aim was the defeat of
Nazism. Once this aim had all but been accomplished, the
many differences that troubled East-West relations came
to the surface. Each side committed acts that the other viewed as
unbecoming of allies.
From the perspective of the
Soviets, the United States’ termination of lend-lease aid before
the war was over and its failure to
respond to a Soviet request for a
$6 billion loan for reconstruction
exposed the Western desire to
keep the Soviet state weak. On
the American side, the Soviet
Union’s failure to fulfill its Yalta
pledge on the Declaration on
Liberated Europe as applied to
eastern Europe set a dangerous
precedent. This was evident in
Romania as early as February
1945, when the Soviets engineered a coup and installed a
new government under the
Communist Petra Groza, known
as the ‘‘Little Stalin.’’ One month
later, the Soviets sabotaged the
Polish settlement by arresting
West-leaning Polish leaders and
their sympathizers and placing Soviet-backed Poles in
power. To the Americans, the Soviets seemed to be asserting control of eastern European countries under
puppet Communist regimes.
The Potsdam Conference The conference held in
Potsdam, near Berlin, in July 1945 consequently began
under a cloud of mistrust. Roosevelt had died on April 12
and had been succeeded as president by Harry Truman.
During the conference, Truman received word that the
atomic bomb had been successfully tested. Some historians
have argued that this knowledge resulted in Truman’s
stiffened resolve against the Soviets. Whatever the reasons,
there was a new chilliness in the relations between the
Soviets and the Americans. At Potsdam, Truman demanded free elections throughout eastern Europe. Stalin
responded, ‘‘A freely elected government in any of these
East European countries would be anti-Soviet, and that we
cannot allow.’’11 After a bitterly fought and devastating
war, Stalin sought absolute military security. To him, it
could be gained only by the presence of Communist
states in eastern Europe. Free elections might result in
governments hostile to the Soviets. By the middle of 1945,
only an invasion by Western forces could undo developments in eastern Europe, and after the world’s most destructive conflict had ended, few people favored such a
policy.
As the war slowly receded, the reality of conflicting
ideologies had come back into focus. Many people in the
West interpreted Soviet policy as part of a worldwide
Communist conspiracy. The Soviets viewed Western,
especially American, policy as global capitalist expansionism or, in Leninist terms, economic imperialism.
Vyacheslav Molotov, the Russian foreign minister, referred to the Americans as ‘‘insatiable imperialists’’ and
‘‘warmongering groups of adventurers.’’12 In March 1946,
in a speech to an American audience, former British
prime minister Winston Churchill declared that ‘‘an iron
curtain’’ had ‘‘descended across the continent,’’ dividing
Germany and Europe into two hostile camps. Stalin
branded Churchill’s speech a ‘‘call to war with the Soviet
Union.’’ Only months after the world’s most devastating
conflict had ended, the world seemed once again bitterly
divided.
CONCLUSION
Between 1933 and 1939, Europeans watched as Adolf Hitler rebuilt
Germany into a great military power. For Hitler, military power was
an absolute prerequisite for the creation of a German racial empire
that would dominate Europe and the world for generations. If
Hitler had been successful, the Nazi New Order, built on
authoritarianism, racism, and brutal oppression, would have meant
a triumph of barbarism and the end of freedom and equality, which,
however imperfectly realized, had become important ideals in
Western civilization.
The Nazis lost, but only after tremendous sacrifices and costs.
Much of European civilization lay in ruins, and the old Europe had
disappeared forever. Europeans, accustomed to dominating the
world at the start of the twentieth century, now watched helplessly
at mid-century as the two new superpowers emerging from the two
world wars took control of their destinies. Even before the last
battles had been fought, the United States and the Soviet Union had
arrived at different visions of the postwar world. No sooner had the
war ended than their differences sparked a new and potentially even
more devastating conflict known as the Cold War. Yet even though
Europeans seemed mere pawns in the struggle between the two
superpowers, they managed to stage a remarkable recovery of their
own civilization.
