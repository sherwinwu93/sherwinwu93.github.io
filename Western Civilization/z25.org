British troops in the trenches wait for the signal to attack.
ON JULY 1, 1916, British and French infantry forces attacked
German defensive lines along a 25-mile front near the Somme River
in France. Each soldier carried almost 70 pounds of equipment,
making it ‘‘impossible to move much quicker than a slow walk.’’
German machine guns soon opened fire: ‘‘We were able to see our
comrades move forward in an attempt to cross No-Man’s Land,
only to be mown down like meadow grass,’’ recalled one British soldier. ‘‘I felt sick at the sight of this carnage and remember weeping.’’1 In one day, more than 21,000 British soldiers died. After six
months of fighting, the British had advanced 5 miles; one million
British, French, and German soldiers had been killed or wounded.
Philip Gibbs, an English war correspondent, described what he
saw in the German trenches that the British forces overran:
‘‘Victory! . . . Some of the German dead were young boys, too young
to be killed for old men’s crimes, and others might have been old or
young. One could not tell because they had no faces, and were just
masses of raw flesh in rags of uniforms. Legs and arms lay separate
without any bodies thereabout.’’2
World War I (1914--1918) was the defining event of the twentieth century. It devastated the prewar economic, social, and political
order of Europe, and its uncertain outcome prepared the way for
an even more destructive war. Overwhelmed by the size of its battles, the extent of its casualties, and its effects on all facets of life,
contemporaries referred to it simply as the ‘‘Great War.’’
The Great War was all the more disturbing to Europeans because it came after what many considered an age of progress. There
had been international crises before 1914, but somehow Europeans
had managed to avoid serious and prolonged military confrontations. Material prosperity and a fervid belief in scientific and technological progress had convinced many people that the world was
on the verge of creating the utopia that humans had dreamed of for
centuries. The historian Arnold Toynbee expressed what the pre--
World War I era had meant to his generation:
[We had expected] that life throughout the World would become more rational, more humane, and more democratic and
that, slowly, but surely, political democracy would produce
greater social justice. We had also expected that the progress of
science and technology would make mankind richer, and that
this increasing wealth would gradually spread from a minority
to a majority. We had expected that all this would happen
peacefully. In fact we thought that mankind’s course was set for
an earthly paradise.3
After 1918, it was no longer possible to maintain naive illusions about the progress of Western civilization. As World War I
was followed by the destructiveness of World War II and the mass
murder machines of totalitarian regimes, it became all too apparent
that instead of a utopia, European civilization had become a nightmare. The Great War resulted not only in great loss of life and
property but also in the annihilation of one of the basic intellectual
precepts on which Western civilization had been thought to have
been founded---the belief in progress. World War I and the revolutions it spawned can properly be seen as the first stage in the crisis
of the twentieth century.
The Road to World War I
Q Focus Question: What were the long-range and
immediate causes of World War I?
On June 28, 1914, the heir to the Austrian throne, Archduke Francis Ferdinand, was assassinated in the Bosnian
city of Sarajevo. Although this event precipitated the confrontation between Austria and Serbia that led to World
War I, underlying forces had been propelling Europeans
toward armed conflict for a long time.
Nationalism and Internal Dissent
In the first half of the nineteenth century, liberals had
maintained that the organization of European states
along national lines would lead to a peaceful Europe
based on a sense of international fraternity. They were
very wrong. The system of nation-states that had
emerged in Europe in the second half of the nineteenth
century led not to cooperation but to competition.
Rivalries over colonial and commercial interests intensified during an era of frenzied imperialist expansion
while the division of Europe’s great powers into two
loose alliances (Germany, Austria, and Italy versus
France, Great Britain, and Russia; see Map 25.1) only
added to the tensions. The series of crises that tested
these alliances in the 1900s and early 1910s had left
European states with the belief that their allies were
important and that their security depended on supporting those allies, even when they took foolish risks.
The growth of nationalism in the nineteenth century had yet another serious consequence. Not all ethnic
groups had achieved the goal of nationhood. Slavic
minorities in the Balkans and the polyglot Habsburg
empire, for example, still dreamed of creating their own
national states. So did the Irish in the British Empire and
the Poles in the Russian Empire.
National aspirations, however, were not the only
source of internal strife at the beginning of the twentieth
century. Socialist labor movements had grown more
powerful and were increasingly inclined to use strikes,
even violent ones, to achieve their goals. Some conservative leaders, alarmed at the increase in labor strife and
class division, even feared that European nations were on
the verge of revolution. Did these statesmen opt for war
in 1914 because they believed that ‘‘prosecuting an active
foreign policy,’’ as one leader expressed it, would smother
‘‘internal troubles’’? Some historians have argued that the
desire to suppress internal disorder may have encouraged
some leaders to take the plunge into war in 1914.
Militarism
The growth of large mass armies after 1900 not only
heightened the existing tensions in Europe but also
made it inevitable that if war did come, it would be
enormously destructive. Conscription (obligatory military service) had been established as a regular practice in
most Western countries before 1914 (the United States
and Britain were major exceptions). European military
machines had doubled in size between 1890 and 1914.
With its 1.3 million men, the Russian army had grown to
be the largest, while the French and Germans were not
far behind with 900,000 each. The British, Italian, and
Austrian armies numbered between 250,000 and 500,000
soldiers each.
Militarism, however, involved more than just large
armies. As armies grew, so did the influence of military
leaders, who drew up vast and complex plans for quickly
mobilizing millions of men and enormous quantities of
supplies in the event of war. Fearful that changes in these
plans would cause chaos in the armed forces, military
leaders insisted that their plans could not be altered. In
the crises during the summer of 1914, the generals’ lack of
flexibility forced European political leaders to make decisions for military instead of political reasons.
The Outbreak of War: The Summer of 1914
Militarism, nationalism, and the desire to stifle internal
dissent may all have played a role in the coming of World
War I, but the decisions made by European leaders in the
summer of 1914 directly precipitated the conflict. It was
another crisis in the Balkans that forced this predicament
on European statesmen.
Another Crisis in the Balkans States in southeastern
Europe had struggled to free themselves of Ottoman
rule for more than a century. But the rivalry between
Austria-Hungary and Russia for domination of these
new states created serious tensions in the region. By
1914, Serbia, supported by Russia, was determined to
create a large, independent Slavic state in the Balkans,
whereas Austria, which had its own Slavic minorities to
contend with, was equally set on preventing that possibility. Many Europeans perceived the inherent dangers in this combination of Serbian ambition bolstered
by Russian opposition to Austria and Austria’s conviction that Serbia’s success would mean the end of
its empire. The British ambassador to Vienna wrote
in 1913:
Serbia will some day set Europe by the ears, and bring about
a universal war on the Continent. . . . I cannot tell you how
exasperated people are getting here at the continual worry
which that little country causes to Austria under encouragement from Russia. . . . It will be lucky if Europe succeeds in
avoiding war as a result of the present crisis. The next time a
Serbian crisis arises . . . , I feel sure that Austria-Hungary will
refuse to admit of any Russian interference in the dispute
and that she will proceed to settle her differences with her
little neighbor by herself.4
It was against this backdrop of mutual distrust and hatred
that the events of the summer of 1914 played out.
The Assassination of Francis Ferdinand The assassination of the Austrian archduke Francis Ferdinand and
his wife, Sophia, on June 28, 1914, was carried out by a
Bosnian activist who worked for the Black Hand, a
Serbian terrorist organization dedicated to the creation
of a pan-Slavic kingdom. Although the Austrian government did not know whether the Serbian government
had been directly involved in the archduke’s assassination, it saw an opportunity to ‘‘render Serbia innocuous
once and for all by a display of force,’’ as the Austrian
foreign minister put it. Fearful of Russian intervention
on Serbia’s behalf, Austrian leaders sought the backing
of their German allies. Emperor William II and his
chancellor gave their assurance that Austria-Hungary
could rely on Germany’s ‘‘full support,’’ even if ‘‘matters
went to the length of a war between Austria-Hungary
and Russia.’’
Declarations of War Strengthened by German support,
Austrian leaders issued an ultimatum to Serbia on July 23
in which they made such extreme demands that Serbia
had little choice but to reject some of them in order to
preserve its sovereignty. Austria then declared war on
Serbia on July 28. Still smarting from its humiliation in
the Bosnian crisis of 1908, Russia was determined to
support Serbia’s cause. On July 28, Tsar Nicholas II ordered partial mobilization of the Russian army against
Austria. At this point, the Russian General Staff informed
the tsar that its mobilization plans were based on a war
against both Germany and Austria simultaneously. They
could not execute partial mobilization without creating
chaos in the army. Consequently, the Russian government
ordered full mobilization of the Russian army on July 29,
knowing that the Germans would consider this an act of
war against them. Germany responded to Russian mobilization with its own ultimatum that the Russians must
halt their mobilization within twelve hours. When the
Russians ignored it, Germany declared war on Russia
on August 1.
At this stage of the conflict, German war plans
determined whether or not France would become involved in the war. Under the guidance of General Alfred
von Schlieffen, chief of staff from 1891 to 1905, the
German General Staff had devised a military plan based
on the assumption of a two-front war with France and
Russia, since the two powers had formed a military
alliance in 1894. The Schlieffen Plan called for a minimal troop deployment against Russia while most of the
German army would rapidly invade western France by
way of neutral Belgium. After the planned quick defeat
of the French, the German army expected to redeploy to
the east against Russia. Under the Schlieffen Plan,
Germany could not mobilize its troops solely against
Russia and therefore declared war
on France on
August 3 after issuing an ultimatum to Belgium on
August 2 demanding the right of
German troops to
pass through Belgian territory. On
August 4, Great
Britain declared war
on Germany, officially over this violation of Belgian
neutrality but in
fact over the British
desire to maintain
world power. As
one British diplomat argued, if Germany and Austria won
the war, ‘‘what would be the position of a friendless
England?’’ By August 4, all the great powers of Europe
were at war.
The Great War
Q Focus Questions: What did the belligerents expect at
the beginning of World War I, and why did the course
of the war turn out to be so different from their
expectations? How did World War I affect the
belligerents’ governmental and political institutions,
economic affairs, and social life?
Before 1914, many political leaders had become convinced that war involved so many political and economic
risks that it was not worth fighting. Others had
believed that ‘‘rational’’ diplomats could control
any situation and prevent the outbreak of war.
At the beginning of August 1914, both of these
prewar illusions were shattered, but the new
illusions that replaced them soon proved to be
equally foolish.
1914--1915: Illusions and Stalemate
Europeans went to war in 1914 with remarkable enthusiasm. Government propaganda
had been successful in stirring up national
antagonisms before the war. Now in August
1914, the urgent pleas of governments for
defense against aggressors fell on receptive
ears in every belligerent nation. Most people
seemed genuinely convinced that their nation’s cause was just. A new set of illusions
also fed the enthusiasm for war. Almost
everyone in August 1914 believed that the
war would be over in a few weeks. People
were reminded that all European wars since
1815 had in fact ended in a matter of
weeks, ignoring the American Civil War (1861--
1865), which was the true prototype for a
‘‘modern’’ war. Both the soldiers who exuberantly boarded the trains for the war front in
August 1914 and the jubilant citizens who
bombarded them with flowers when they departed believed that the warriors would be
home by Christmas.
German hopes for a quick end to the war
rested on a military gamble. The Schlieffen
Plan had called for the German army to make
a vast encircling movement through Belgium
into northern France that would sweep
around Paris and surround most of the
French army. But the German advance was
halted only 20 miles east of Paris at the first
Battle of the Marne (September 6--10; see
Map 25.2). The war quickly turned into a
stalemate---neither the Germans nor the
French could dislodge each other from the
trenches they had begun to dig for shelter.
Two lines of trenches soon extended from the
English Channel to the frontiers of Switzerland. The Western Front had become bogged
down in trench warfare that kept both
sides immobilized in virtually the same positions for
four years.
In contrast to the west, the war in the east was
marked by much more mobility, although the cost in lives
was equally enormous. At the beginning of the war,
the Russian army moved into eastern Germany but was
decisively defeated at the Battles of Tannenberg on
August 26--30 and the Masurian Lakes on September 15
(see Map 25.3). The Russians were no longer a threat to
German territory.
The Austrians, Germany’s allies, fared less well initially. They had been defeated by the Russians in Galicia
and thrown out of Serbia as well. To make matters worse,
the Italians broke their alliance with the Germans and
Austrians and entered the war on the Allied side by attacking Austria in May 1915. By this time, the Germans
had come to the aid of the Austrians. A German-Austrian
army defeated and routed the Russian army in Galicia
and pushed the Russians back 300 miles into their own
territory. Russian casualties stood
at 2.5 million killed, captured, or
wounded; the Russians had almost
been knocked out of the war. Buoyed
by their success, the Germans and
Austrians, joined by the Bulgarians in
September 1915, attacked and eliminated Serbia from the war.
1916--1917: The Great
Slaughter
The successes in the east enabled
the Germans to move back to the
offensive in the west. The early
trenches dug in 1914 had by now
become elaborate systems of defense.
Both lines of trenches were protected
by barbed-wire entanglements 3 to
5 feet high and 30 yards wide, concrete machine-gun nests, and mortar
batteries, supported farther back by
heavy artillery. Troops lived in holes
in the ground, separated from each
other by a ‘‘no-man’s land.’’
The unexpected development of
trench warfare baffled military leaders, who had been trained to fight
wars of movement and maneuver.
Periodically, the high command on
either side would order an offensive
that would begin with an artillery
barrage to flatten the enemy’s barbed
wire and leave the enemy in a state of
shock. After ‘‘softening up’’ the enemy
in this fashion, a mass of soldiers
would climb out of their trenches
with fixed bayonets and hope to work
their way toward the enemy trenches.
The attacks rarely worked, since the
machine gun put hordes of men advancing unprotected across open fields at a severe disadvantage. In 1916 and 1917, millions of young men were
killed in the search for the elusive breakthrough. In ten
months at Verdun, 700,000 men lost their lives over a few
miles of terrain. At the Battle of the Somme, the British
suffered 57,000 casualties, including 21,000 dead, on the
first day of the battle, the heaviest one-day loss in World
War I.
Warfare in the trenches of the Western Front produced unimaginable horrors. Battlefields were hellish
landscapes of barbed wire, shell holes, mud, and injured
and dying men. The introduction of poison gas in 1915
produced new forms of injuries, as one British writer
described:
I wish those people who write so glibly about this being a
holy war could see a case of mustard gas . . . could see the
poor things burnt and blistered all over with great mustardcoloured suppurating blisters with blind eyes all sticky . . .
and stuck together, and always fighting for breath, with
voices a mere whisper, saying that their throats are closing
and they know they will choke.5
Soldiers in the trenches also lived
with the persistent presence of death
(see the box on p. 542). Because
combat went on for months, soldiers
had to carry on in the midst of
countless bodies of dead men or the
remains of men dismembered by artillery barrages. Many soldiers remembered the stench of decomposing
bodies and the swarms of rats that
grew fat in the trenches.
The Widening of the War
As another response to the stalemate
on the Western Front, both sides
sought to gain new allies who might
provide a winning advantage. The
Ottoman Empire had already come
into the war on Germany’s side in
August 1914. Russia, Great Britain,
and France declared war on the
Ottoman Empire in November. Although the Allies attempted to open
a Balkan front by landing forces
at Gallipoli, southwest of Constantinople, in April 1915, the entry of
Bulgaria into the war on the side of the
Central Powers (as Germany, AustriaHungary, and the Ottoman Empire
were called) and a disastrous campaign at Gallipoli caused them to
withdraw. The Italians, as noted, also
entered the war on the Allied side after
France and Britain promised to further their acquisition of Austrian territory. In the long run, however, Italian
military incompetence forced the Allies to come to the assistance of Italy.
A Global Conflict The war that
originated in Europe rapidly spiraled
into a worldwide conflict. In the
Middle East, a British officer who came to be known as
Lawrence of Arabia (1888--1935) incited Arab princes to
revolt against their Ottoman overlords in 1917. In 1918,
British forces from Egypt destroyed the rest of the
Ottoman Empire in the Middle East. For their Middle
East campaigns, the British mobilized forces from India,
Australia, and New Zealand.
The Allies also took advantage of Germany’s preoccupations in Europe and lack of naval strength to seize
German colonies in Africa and Asia. In the battles in
Africa, Allied governments drew on mainly African soldiers, but some states, especially France, also recruited
African troops to fight in Europe. The French drafted
more than 170,000 West African soldiers, many of whom
fought in the trenches on the Western
front. About 80,000 Africans were killed or
injured in Europe. They were often at a
distinct disadvantage due to the unfamiliar
terrain and climate.
Hundreds of thousands of Africans
were also used for labor, especially for
carrying supplies and building roads and
bridges. In East Africa, both sides drafted
African laborers as carriers for their armies.
Disease and starvation caused by neglect
led to the death of more than 100,000 of
these laborers.
In East Asia and the Pacific, Japan
joined the Allies on August 23, 1914, primarily to seize control of German territories in China and the Pacific. New Zealand
and Australia quickly joined the Japanese
in conquering the German-held parts of
New Guinea.
Entry of the United States Most important to the Allied cause was the entry of
the United States into the war. At first, the
United States tried to remain neutral in the
Great War, but it found neutrality difficult
to maintain as the war dragged on. The immediate spur to
American involvement grew out of the naval conflict between Germany and Great Britain. Britain used its superior
naval power to maximum effect by throwing up a naval
blockade of Germany. Germany retaliated by imposing a
counterblockade enforced by unrestricted submarine warfare. Strong American protests over the German sinking of
passenger liners, especially the British ship Lusitania on
May 7, 1915, in which more than one hundred Americans
lost their lives, forced the German government to suspend
unrestricted submarine warfare in September 1915 to
avoid further antagonizing the Americans.
In January 1917, however, eager to break the deadlock in the war, the Germans decided to gamble by returning to unrestricted submarine warfare. German naval
officers convinced Emperor William II that use of the
submarines could starve the British into submission
within five months, before the Americans could act. The
return to unrestricted submarine warfare brought the
United States into the war on April 6, 1917. Although
American troops did not arrive in large numbers in
Europe until 1918, the entry of the United States into the
war in 1917 gave the Allied Powers a psychological boost
when they needed it. The year 1917 was not a good year
for them. Allied offensives on the Western Front were
disastrously defeated. The Italian armies were smashed in
October, and the following month, the Bolshevik revolution (see ‘‘The Russian Revolution’’ later in this chapter)
led to Russia’s withdrawal from the war. The cause of the
Central Powers looked favorable, although war weariness
in the Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria, Austria-Hungary, and
Germany was beginning to take its toll. The home front
was rapidly becoming a cause for as much concern as the
war front.
The Home Front: The Impact of Total War
The prolongation of World War I made it a total war that
affected the lives of all citizens, however remote they
might be from the battlefields. The need to organize
masses of men and mate´riel for years of combat (Germany
alone had 5.5 million men in active units in 1916) led to
increased centralization of government powers, economic
regimentation, and manipulation of public opinion to
keep the war effort going.
Political Centralization and Economic Regimentation Because the war was expected to be short, little
thought had been given to economic problems and longterm wartime needs. Governments had to respond
quickly, however, when the war machines failed to
achieve their knockout blows and made ever-greater demands for men and mate´riel. The extension of government power was a logical outgrowth of these needs. Most
European countries had already devised some system of
mass conscription or military draft. It was now carried to
unprecedented heights as countries mobilized millions of
young men for that elusive breakthrough to victory. Even
countries that continued to rely on volunteers (Great
Britain had the largest volunteer army in modern history---
one million men---in 1914 and 1915) were forced to resort
to conscription, especially to ensure that skilled laborers
did not enlist but remained in factories that were important to the production of munitions. In 1916, despite
widespread resistance to this extension of government
power, compulsory military service was introduced in
Great Britain.
Throughout Europe, wartime governments expanded
their powers over their economies. Free market capitalistic
systems were temporarily shelved as governments experimented with price, wage, and rent controls, the rationing of food supplies and materials, the regulation of
imports and exports, the nationalization of transportation systems and industries, and compulsory labor employment. In effect, to mobilize the entire resources of
their nations for the war effort, European nations had
moved toward planned economies directed by government agencies. Under total war mobilization, the distinction between soldiers at war and civilians at home was
narrowed. In the view of political leaders, all citizens
constituted a national army dedicated to victory. As the
American president Woodrow Wilson expressed it, the
men and women ‘‘who remain to till the soil and man
the factories are no less a part of the army than the men
beneath the battle flags.’’
Public Order and Public Opinion As the Great War
dragged on and both casualties and privations worsened,
internal dissatisfaction replaced the patriotic enthusiasm
that had marked the early stages of the conflict. By 1916,
there were numerous signs that civilian morale was beginning to crack. War governments, however, fought back
against the growing opposition to the war. Authoritarian
regimes, such as those of Germany, Russia, and AustriaHungary, had always relied on force to subdue their
populations. Under the pressures of the war, however,
even parliamentary regimes resorted to an expansion of
police powers to stifle internal dissent. At the very beginning of the war, the British Parliament passed the
Defence of the Realm Act (DORA), which allowed the
public authorities to arrest dissenters as traitors. The act
was later extended to authorize public officials to censor
newspapers by deleting objectionable material and even
to suspend newspaper publication. In France, government authorities had initially been lenient about public
opposition to the war. But when Georges Clemenceau
became premier near the end of 1917, the lenient French
policies came to an end, and basic civil liberties were
suppressed for the duration of the war. The editor of an
antiwar newspaper was even executed on a charge of
treason.
Wartime governments made active use of propaganda to arouse enthusiasm for the war. At the beginning,
public officials needed to do little to achieve this goal. The
British and French, for example, exaggerated German
atrocities in Belgium and found that their citizens were
only too willing to believe these accounts. But as the war
progressed and morale sagged, governments were forced
to devise new techniques for reviving flagging enthusiasm. In one British recruiting poster, for example, a small
daughter asked her father, ‘‘Daddy, what did YOU do in
the Great War?’’ while her younger brother played with
toy soldiers and cannons.
The Social Impact of Total War Total war had a significant impact on European society, most visibly by
bringing an end to unemployment. The withdrawal of
millions of men from the labor market to fight, combined
with the heightened demand for wartime products, led to
jobs for everyone able to work.
World War I also created new roles for women. With
so many men off fighting at the front, women were called
on to take over jobs and responsibilities that had not been
available to them before. They were now employed in jobs
that had earlier been considered ‘‘beyond the capacity of
women,’’ including such occupations as chimney sweeps,
truck drivers, farm laborers, and factory workers in heavy
industry (see the box on p. 546). Thirty-eight percent of
the workers in the Krupp Armaments works in Germany
in 1918 were women.
While male workers expressed concern that the employment of females at lower wages would depress their
own wages, women began to demand equal pay. The
French government passed a law in July 1915 that established a minimum wage for women homeworkers in
textiles, an industry that had grown dramatically because
of the need for military uniforms. Two years later, the
government decreed that men and women should receive
equal rates for piecework. Despite the noticeable increase
in women’s wages that resulted from government regulations, women’s industrial wages were still not equal to
men’s wages by the end of the war.
Even worse, women had achieved little real security
about their place in the workforce. Both men and women
seemed to think that many of the new jobs for women
were only temporary, an expectation quite evident in the
British poem ‘‘War Girls,’’ written in 1916:
There’s the girl who clips your ticket for the train,
And the girl who speeds the lift from floor to floor,
There’s the girl who does a milk-round in the rain,
And the girl who calls for orders at your door.
Strong, sensible, and fit,
They’re out to show their grit,
And tackle jobs with energy and knack.
No longer caged and penned up,
They’re going to keep their end up
Till the khaki soldier boys come marching back.6
At the end of the war, governments moved quickly to
remove women from the jobs they had been encouraged
to take earlier. By 1919, there were 650,000 unemployed
women in Britain, and wages for women who were still
employed had been lowered. The work benefits for
women from World War I seemed to be short-lived.
Nevertheless, in some countries, the role played by
women in the wartime economies did have a positive
impact on women’s crusade for social and political
emancipation. The most obvious gain was the right to
vote, given to women in Germany and Austria immediately after the war (Britain had done the same in January
1918). The Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution
gave women in the United States the right to vote in 1920.
Contemporary media, however, tended to focus on the
more noticeable, yet in some ways more superficial,
social emancipation of upper- and middle-class women.
In ever-larger numbers, these young women took jobs,
had their own apartments, and flaunted their new independence by smoking in public and wearing shorter
dresses, cosmetics, and boyish hairstyles.
War and Revolution
Q Focus Question: What were the causes of the Russian
Revolution of 1917, and why did the Bolsheviks
prevail in the civil war and gain control of Russia?
By 1917, total war was creating serious domestic turmoil in
all of the European belligerent states. Only one, however,
experienced the kind of complete collapse in 1917 that
others were predicting might happen throughout Europe.
Out of Russia’s collapse came the Russian Revolution.
The Russian Revolution
Tsar Nicholas II was an autocratic ruler who relied on the
army and bureaucracy to prop up his regime. Russia was
unprepared both militarily and technologically for the
total war of World War I. Competent military leadership
was lacking, and Russian industry was unable to produce
the weapons needed for the army. Ill-led and ill-armed,
Russian armies suffered incredible losses. Between 1914
and 1916, two million soldiers had been killed and another four to six million had been wounded or captured.
In the meantime, the tsar was increasingly insulated
from events by his German-born wife, Alexandra, a welleducated woman who had fallen under the influence of
Rasputin, a Siberian peasant whom the tsarina regarded
as a holy man because he alone seemed able to stop the
bleeding of her hemophiliac son, Alexis. Rasputin’s influence made him an important power behind the throne,
and he did not hesitate to interfere in government affairs.
As the leadership at the top stumbled its way through a
series of military and economic disasters, the middle
class, aristocrats, peasants, soldiers, and workers grew
more and more disenchanted with the tsarist regime.
Even conservative aristocrats who supported the monarchy felt the need to do something to reverse the deteriorating situation. For a start, they assassinated Rasputin
in December 1916. By then it was too late to save the
monarchy, and its fall came quickly.
The March Revolution At the beginning of March
1917, a series of strikes broke out in the capital city of
Petrograd (the renamed Saint Petersburg). Here the actions of working-class women helped change the course
of Russian history. Weeks earlier, the government had
introduced bread rationing in the city after the price of
bread skyrocketed. Many of the women who stood in the
lines waiting for bread were also factory workers who put
in twelve-hour days. The Russian government had become aware of the volatile situation in the capital from a
police report:
Mothers of families, exhausted by endless standing in line at
stores, distraught over their half-starving and sick children,
are today perhaps closer to revolution than [the liberal opposition leaders,] and of course they are a great deal more dangerous because they are the combustible material for which
only a single spark is needed to burst into flame.7
On March 8, about ten thousand Petrograd women
marched through the city chanting ‘‘Peace and Bread’’
and ‘‘Down with Autocracy.’’ Soon the women were
joined by other workers, and together they called for a
general strike that succeeded in shutting down all the
factories in the city on March 10. Nicholas ordered the
troops to disperse the crowds by shooting them if necessary, but soon significant numbers of the soldiers joined
the demonstrators. The Duma, the legislative body that
the tsar had tried to dissolve, met anyway and on March 12
declared that it was assuming governmental responsibility.
It established a provisional government on March 15; the
tsar abdicated the same day.
In just one week, the tsarist regime had fallen apart.
Although no particular group had been responsible for
the outburst, the moderate Constitutional Democrats
were responsible for establishing the provisional government. They represented primarily a middle-class and
liberal aristocratic minority. Their program consisted of
a liberal agenda that included working toward a parliamentary democracy and passing reforms that provided universal suffrage, civil equality, and an eighthour workday.
The Provisional Government also faced another
authority, the soviets, or councils of workers’ and soldiers’ deputies. Soviets sprang up spontaneously in cities,
factory towns, army units, and rural areas. The soviets
represented the more radical interests of the lower classes
and were largely composed of socialists of different
kinds. One group, the Bolsheviks, came to play a crucial
role.
The Bolshevik Revolution The Bolsheviks were a small
faction of Marxist Social Democrats who had come under
the leadership of Vladimir Ulianov, known to the world
as V. I. Lenin (1870--1924). Arrested for his revolutionary
activity, Lenin was shipped to Siberia. After his release, he
chose to go into exile in Switzerland and eventually assumed the leadership of the Bolshevik wing of the
Russian Social Democratic Party. Under Lenin’s direction,
the Bolsheviks became a party dedicated to a violent
revolution that would destroy the capitalist system. He
believed that a ‘‘vanguard’’ of activists must form a small
group of well-disciplined professional revolutionaries to
accomplish the task. Lenin spent most of the years between 1900 and 1917 in Switzerland. When the provisional government was formed in March 1917, he
believed that an opportunity for the Bolsheviks to seize
power had come. Shortly thereafter, with the connivance
of the German High Command, who hoped to create
disorder in Russia, Lenin was shipped to Russia in a
‘‘sealed train’’ by way of Finland.
Lenin’s arrival opened a new stage of the Russian
Revolution. Lenin maintained that the soviets of soldiers, workers, and peasants were ready-made instruments of power. The Bolsheviks must work toward
gaining control of these groups and then use them to
overthrow the provisional government. At the same
time, the Bolsheviks articulated the discontent and aspirations of the people, promising an end to the war,
redistribution of all land to the peasants, the transfer of
factories and industries from capitalists to committees of
workers, and the relegation of government power from
the provisional government to the soviets. Three simple
slogans summed up the Bolshevik program: ‘‘Peace,
Land, Bread,’’ ‘‘Worker Control of Production,’’ and ‘‘All
Power to the Soviets.’’
By the end of October, the Bolsheviks had achieved a
slight majority in the Petrograd and Moscow soviets. The
number of party members had also grown from 50,000 to
240,000. With Leon Trotsky (1877--1940), a fervid revolutionary, as chairman of the Petrograd soviet, the Bolsheviks were in a position to seize power in the name of
the soviets. During the night of November 6, pro-soviet
and pro-Bolshevik forces took control of Petrograd under
the immensely popular slogan ‘‘All Power to the Soviets.’’
The provisional government collapsed with little bloodshed. The following night, the all-Russian Congress of
Soviets, representing local soviets from all over the
country, affirmed the transfer of power. At the second
session, the night of November 8, Lenin announced the
new Soviet government, the Council of People’s Commissars, with himself as its head.
But the Bolsheviks, soon renamed the Communists,
still had a long way to go (see the box on p. 549). Lenin
had promised peace, and that, he realized, was not easy
to deliver because of the humiliating losses of Russian
territory that it would entail. There was no real choice,
however. On March 3, 1918, Lenin signed the Treaty of
Brest-Litovsk with Germany and gave up eastern
Poland, Ukraine, Finland, and the Baltic provinces.
To his critics, Lenin argued that it made no difference
since the spread of socialist revolution throughout Europe would make the treaty largely irrelevant. In any
case, he had promised peace to the Russian people; but
real peace did not come because the country soon sank
into civil war.
Civil War There was great opposition to the new
Bolshevik or Communist regime, not only from groups
loyal to the tsar but also from bourgeois and aristocratic
liberals and anti-Leninist socialists. In addition, thousands of Allied troops were eventually sent to different
parts of Russia in the hope of bringing Russia back into
the war.
Between 1918 and 1921, the Bolshevik (Red) Army
was forced to fight on many fronts. The first serious
threat to the Bolsheviks came from Siberia, where an
anti-Bolshevik (White) force attacked westward and
advanced almost to the Volga River before being stopped.
Attacks also came from the Ukrainians in the southeast
and from the Baltic regions. In mid-1919, White forces
swept through Ukraine and advanced almost to Moscow.
At one point toward the end of 1919, three separate
White armies seemed to be closing in on the Bolsheviks
but were eventually pushed back. By 1920, the major
White forces had been defeated and Ukraine had
been retaken. The next year, the Communist regime regained control over the independent nationalist governments in the Caucasus: Georgia, Russian Armenia,
and Azerbaijan.
The royal family was yet another victim of the civil
war. After the tsar had abdicated, he, his wife, and their
five children had been taken into captivity. They were
moved in August 1917 to Tobolsk in Siberia and in April
1918 to Ekaterinburg, a mining town in the Urals. On the
night of July 16, members of the local soviet murdered
the tsar and his family and burned their bodies in a
nearby mine shaft.
How had Lenin and the Bolsheviks triumphed over
what seemed at one time to be overwhelming forces? For
one thing, the Red Army became a well-disciplined and
formidable fighting force, due largely to the organizational genius of Leon Trotsky. As commissar of war,
Trotsky reinstated the draft and insisted on rigid discipline; soldiers who deserted or refused to obey orders
were summarily executed.
The disunity of the anti-Communist forces seriously
weakened their efforts. Political differences created distrust among the Whites and prevented them from cooperating effectively. Some Whites insisted on restoring
the tsarist regime, while others understood that only a
more liberal and democratic program had any chance of
success. It was difficult enough to achieve military cooperation; political differences made it virtually impossible. The lack of a common goal on the part of the
Whites was paralleled by a clear sense of purpose on the
part of the Reds. Inspired by their vision of a new socialist
order, the Communists had the advantage of possessing
the determination that comes from revolutionary fervor
and strong convictions.
The Communists also succeeded in translating their
revolutionary faith into practical instruments of power. A
policy of war communism, for example, was used to ensure regular supplies for the Red Army. War communism
included the nationalization of banks and most industries,
the forcible requisition of grain from peasants, and the
centralization of state administration under Bolshevik
control. Another Bolshevik instrument was ‘‘revolutionary
terror.’’ Although the old tsarist secret police had been
abolished, a new Red secret police---known as the Cheka---
replaced it. The Red Terror instituted by the Cheka aimed
at nothing less than the destruction of all opponents of the
new regime.
Finally, the intervention of foreign armies enabled the
Communists to appeal to the powerful force of Russian
patriotism. Although the Allied Powers had intervened
initially in Russia to encourage the Russians to remain in
the war, the end of the war on November 11, 1918, had
made that purpose inconsequential. Nevertheless, Allied
troops remained, and even more were sent because Allied
countries did not hide their anti-Bolshevik feelings. At one
point, more than 100,000 foreign troops, mostly Japanese,
British, French, and American, were stationed on Russian
soil. These forces rarely engaged in pitched battles, however, nor did they pursue a common strategy, although
they did give material assistance to anti-Bolshevik forces.
This intervention by the Allies enabled the Communist
government to appeal to patriotic Russians to fight the
attempts of foreigners to control their country.
By 1921, the Communists had succeeded in retaining
control of Russia. In the course of the civil war, the
Bolshevik regime had also transformed Russia into a
bureaucratically centralized state dominated by a single
party. It was also a state that was largely hostile to the
Allied Powers, who had sought to assist the Bolsheviks’
enemies in the civil war.
The Last Year of the War
For Germany, the withdrawal of the Russians from the
war in March 1918 offered renewed hope for a favorable
end to the war. The victory over Russia persuaded Erich
Ludendorff, who guided German military operations, and
most German leaders to make one final military gamble---
a grand offensive in the west to break the military stalemate. The German attack was launched in March and
lasted into July, but an Allied counterattack, supported by
the arrival of 140,000 fresh American troops, defeated the
Germans at the Second Battle of the Marne on July 18.
Ludendorff’s gamble had failed. With the arrival of two
million more American troops on the Continent, Allied
forces began making a steady advance toward Germany.
On September 29, 1918, General Ludendorff informed
German leaders that the war was lost and demanded that
the government sue for peace at once. When German
officials discovered that the Allies were unwilling to make
peace with the autocratic imperial government, they instituted reforms to set up a liberal government. But these
constitutional reforms came too late for the exhausted and
angry German people. On November 3, naval units in Kiel
mutinied, and within days, councils of workers and soldiers were forming throughout northern Germany and
taking over the supervision of civilian and military administrations. William II capitulated to public pressure
and abdicated on November 9, and the Socialists under
Friedrich Ebert announced the establishment of a republic.
Two days later, on November 11, 1918, the new German
government agreed to an armistice. The war was over.
The Casualties of the War World War I devastated
European civilization. Between 8 and 9 million soldiers
died on the battlefields; another 22 million were
wounded. Many of those who survived later died from
war injuries or suffered the loss of arms or legs or other
forms of mutilation. The birthrate in many European
countries declined noticeably as a result of the death or
maiming of so many young men. World War I also created a ‘‘lost generation’’ of war veterans who had become
accustomed to violence and who would form the postwar
bands of fighters who supported Mussolini and Hitler in
their bids for power (see Chapter 26).
Nor did the killing affect only soldiers. Untold numbers of civilians died from war, civil war, or starvation. In
1915, after an Armenian uprising against the Ottoman
government, the government retaliated with fury by killing
Armenian men and expelling women and children. Within
seven months, 600,000 Armenians had been killed, and
500,000 had been deported. Of the latter, 400,000 died
while marching through the deserts and swamps of Syria
and Iraq. By September 1915, an estimated one million
Armenians were dead, the victims of genocide.
The Peace Settlement
Q Focus Question: What were the objectives of the chief
participants at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919,
and how closely did the final settlement reflect these
objectives?
In January 1919, the delegations of twenty-seven victorious
Allied nations gathered in Paris to conclude a final settlement of the Great War. Over the years, the reasons for
fighting World War I had been transformed from selfish
national interests to idealistic principles. No one expressed
the latter better than United States President Woodrow
Wilson. Wilson’s proposals for a truly just and lasting peace
included ‘‘open covenants of peace, openly arrived at’’ instead of secret diplomacy; the reduction of national armaments to a ‘‘point consistent with domestic safety’’; and
the self-determination of people so that ‘‘all well-defined
national aspirations shall be accorded the utmost satisfaction.’’ Wilson characterized World War I as a people’s war
waged against ‘‘absolutism and militarism,’’ two scourges of
liberty that could be eliminated only by creating democratic governments and a ‘‘general association of nations’’
that would guarantee the ‘‘political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike’’ (see the box
on p. 552). As the spokesman for a new world order based
on democracy and international cooperation, Wilson was
enthusiastically cheered by many Europeans when he arrived in Europe for the peace conference.
Wilson soon found, however, that other states at the
Paris Peace Conference were guided by considerably more
pragmatic motives. The secret treaties and agreements that
had been made before the war could not be totally ignored, even if they did conflict with the principle of selfdetermination enunciated by Wilson. National interests
also complicated the deliberations of the conference.
David Lloyd George, prime minister of Great Britain, had
won a decisive electoral victory in December 1918 on a
platform of making the Germans pay for this dreadful war.
France’s approach to peace was determined primarily
by considerations of national security. To Georges Clemenceau, the feisty premier of France who had led his
country to victory, the French people had borne the brunt
of German aggression. They deserved revenge and security
against future German aggression. Clemenceau wanted a
demilitarized Germany, vast German reparations to pay
for the costs of the war, and a separate Rhineland as a
buffer state between France and Germany.
The most important decisions at the Paris Peace
Conference were made by Wilson, Clemenceau, and Lloyd
George. Italy was considered one of the so-called Big Four
powers but played a much less important role than the
other three countries. Germany, of course, was not invited
to attend, and Russia could not do so because of its civil war.
In view of the many conflicting demands at Versailles,
it was inevitable that the Big Three would quarrel. Wilson
was determined to create a ‘‘league of nations’’ to prevent
future wars. Clemenceau and Lloyd George were equally
determined to punish Germany. In the end, only compromise made it possible to achieve a peace settlement.
On January 25, 1919, the conference adopted the principle of a league of nations, and Wilson agreed to make
compromises on territorial arrangements. Clemenceau
also compromised to obtain some guarantees for French
security. He renounced France’s desire for a separate
Rhineland and instead accepted a defensive alliance with
Great Britain and the United States. Both states pledged
to help France if it were attacked by Germany.
The Treaty of Versailles
The final peace settlement of Paris consisted of five separate treaties with the defeated nations---Germany, Austria
and Hungary (now separate nations), Bulgaria, and Turkey (see Map 25.4). The Treaty of Versailles with Germany,
signed on June 28, 1919, was by far the most important
one. The Germans considered it a harsh peace and were
particularly unhappy with Article 231, the so-called War
Guilt Clause, which declared Germany (and Austria)
responsible for starting the war and ordered Germany to
pay reparations for all the damage the Allied governments
and their people suffered as a result of the war.
The military and territorial provisions of the treaty
also rankled Germans, although they were by no means as
harsh as the Germans claimed. Germany had to reduce its
army to 100,000 men, cut back its navy, and eliminate its
air force. German territorial losses included the cession of
Alsace and Lorraine to France and sections of Prussia to
the new Polish state (known as the Polish Corridor).
German land west and as far as 30 miles east of the Rhine
was established as a demilitarized zone and stripped of all
armaments or fortifications to serve as a barrier to any
future German military moves westward against France.
Outraged by the ‘‘dictated peace,’’
the new German government complained but accepted the treaty.
The Other Peace Treaties
The separate peace treaties made
with the other Central Powers
(Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, and the
Ottoman Empire) extensively redrew the map of eastern Europe.
Many of these changes merely ratified what the war had already accomplished. Both the German and
Russian empires lost considerable
territory in eastern Europe, and
the Austro-Hungarian empire disappeared altogether. New nationstates emerged from the lands of these three empires:
Finland, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Austria, and Hungary. Territorial rearrangements
were also made in the Balkans. Romania acquired additional lands from Russia, Hungary, and Bulgaria. Serbia
formed the nucleus of a new southern Slav state, the
kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (renamed
Yugoslavia in 1929).
Although the Paris Peace Conference was supposedly
guided by the principle of self-determination, the mixtures of peoples in eastern Europe made it impossible to
draw boundaries along neat ethnic lines. As a result of
compromises, virtually every eastern European state was
left with a minorities problem that could lead to future
conflicts. Germans in Poland; Hungarians, Poles, and
Germans in Czechoslovakia; and Serbs, Croats, Slovenes,
Macedonians, and Albanians in Yugoslavia all became
sources of later conflict.
Yet another centuries-old empire---the Ottoman
Empire---was dismembered by the peace settlement after
the war. To gain Arab support against the Ottomans
during the war, the Allies had promised to recognize the
independence of Arab states in the Middle Eastern lands
of the Ottoman Empire. But the imperialist habits of
Europeans died hard. After the war,
France took control of Lebanon and
Syria while Britain received Iraq and
Palestine. Officially, these acquisitions were called mandates, meaning that the lands were to be
officially administered on behalf of
the newly formed League of Nations. The system of mandates could
not hide the fact that the principle
of national self-determination at the
Paris Peace Conference was largely
for Europeans.
Successful enforcement of the
peace necessitated the active involvement of its principal architects,
especially in helping the new German
state set up a peaceful and democratic republic. The failure of the U.S. Senate to ratify the
Treaty of Versailles, however, meant that the United States
never joined the League of Nations. In addition, the
Senate also rejected Wilson’s defensive alliance with Great
Britain and France. Already by the end of 1919, the
United States was pursuing policies intended to limit its
direct involvement in future European wars.
This retreat had dire consequences. American withdrawal from the defensive alliance with Britain and
France led Britain to withdraw as well. By removing itself
from European affairs, the United States forced France
to stand alone facing its old enemy, leading the embittered nation to take strong actions against Germany that
only intensified German resentment. By the end of 1919,
it appeared that the peace was already beginning to
unravel.

CONCLUSION
World War I shattered the liberal and rational assumptions of latenineteenth- and early-twentieth-century Europe. The incredible
destruction and the death of almost ten million people undermined
the whole idea of progress. New propaganda techniques had
manipulated entire populations into sustaining their involvement in
a meaningless slaughter.
World War I was a total war and involved a mobilization of
resources and populations and increased government centralization of power over the lives of its citizens. Civil liberties, such as
freedom of the press, of speech, of assembly, and of movement,
were circumscribed in the name of national security. Governments’ need to plan the production and distribution of goods and
to ration consumer goods restricted economic freedom. Although
the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries had witnessed
the extension of government authority into such areas as mass
education, social welfare legislation, and mass conscription,
World War I made the practice of strong central authority a way
of life.
Finally, World War I ended the age of European hegemony
over world affairs. In 1917, the Russian Revolution laid the
foundation for a new world power, and the United States entered
the war. The termination of the European age was not evident to all,
however, for it was clouded by two developments---American
isolationism and the withdrawal of the Russian Communists from
world affairs while they nurtured their own socialist system.
Although these developments were only temporary, they created a
political vacuum in Europe that was filled all too soon by a
resurgence of German power.
