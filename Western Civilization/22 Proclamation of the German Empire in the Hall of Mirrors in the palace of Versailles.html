<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf782db1">
<p class="verse">
Across the continent, the revolutions of 1848 had failed.<br />
The forces of liberalism and nationalism appeared to have been decisively defeated<br />
&#xa0;as authoritarian governments reestablished control almost everywhere in Europe by 1850.<br />
And yet within twenty-five years,<br />
&#xa0;many of the goals sought by the liberals and nationalists during the first half of the century<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;seemed to have been achieved.<br />
National unity became a reality in Italy and Germany,<br />
&#xa0;and many European states were governed by constitutional monarchies,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;even though the constitutional-parliamentary features were frequently facades.<br />
<br />
All the same, these goals were not achieved by liberal nationalist leaders<br />
&#xa0;but by a new generation of conservative leaders<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;who were proud of being practitioners of Realpolitik, the 'politics of reality.'<br />
One reaction to the failure of the revolutions of 1848 had been a new toughness of mind<br />
&#xa0;in which people prided themselves on being realistic in their handling of power.<br />
The new conservative leaders used armies and power politics to achieve their foreign policy goals.<br />
And they did not hesitate to manipulate liberal means to achieve conservative ends at home.<br />
Nationalism had failed as a revolutionary movement in 1848&#x2013;1849,<br />
&#xa0;but in the ensuing decades, these new leaders found a variety of ways to pursue nation building.<br />
One of the most successful was the Prussian Otto von Bismarck,<br />
&#xa0;who used both astute diplomacy and war to achieve the unification of Germany.<br />
On January 18, 1871,<br />
&#xa0;Bismarck and six hundred German princes, nobles,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;and generals filled the Hall of Mirrors in the palace of Versailles,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;12 miles outside the city of Paris.<br />
The Prussian army had defeated the French,<br />
&#xa0;and the assembled notables were gathered<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;for the proclamation of the Prussian king as the new emperor of a united German state.<br />
When the words 'Long live His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor William.' rang out,<br />
&#xa0;the assembled guests took up the cry.<br />
One participant wrote,<br />
&#xa0;'A thundering cheer, repeated at least six times, thrilled through the room<br />
&#xa0;while the flags and standards waved over the head of the new emperor of Germany.'<br />
European rulers who feared the power of the new German state were not so cheerful.<br />
'The balance of power has been entirely destroyed,' declared the British prime minister.<br />
