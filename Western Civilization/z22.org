Proclamation of the German Empire in the Hall of Mirrors
in the palace of Versailles
ACROSS THE CONTINENT, the revolutions of 1848 had
failed. The forces of liberalism and nationalism appeared to have
been decisively defeated as authoritarian governments reestablished
control almost everywhere in Europe by 1850. And yet within
twenty-five years, many of the goals sought by the liberals and
nationalists during the first half of the century seemed to have been
achieved. National unity became a reality in Italy and Germany, and
many European states were governed by constitutional monarchies,
even though the constitutional-parliamentary features were
frequently facades.
All the same, these goals were not achieved by liberal nationalist leaders but by a new generation of conservative leaders who were
proud of being practitioners of Realpolitik, the ‘‘politics of reality.’’
One reaction to the failure of the revolutions of 1848 had been a
new toughness of mind in which people prided themselves on being
realistic in their handling of power. The new conservative leaders
used armies and power politics to achieve their foreign policy goals.
And they did not hesitate to manipulate liberal means to achieve
conservative ends at home. Nationalism had failed as a revolutionary
movement in 1848--1849, but in the ensuing decades, these new
leaders found a variety of ways to pursue nation building. One
of the most successful was the Prussian Otto von Bismarck, who
used both astute diplomacy and war to achieve the unification of
Germany. On January 18, 1871, Bismarck and six hundred German
princes, nobles, and generals filled the Hall of Mirrors in the palace
of Versailles, 12 miles outside the city of Paris. The Prussian army
had defeated the French, and the assembled notables were gathered
for the proclamation of the Prussian king as the new emperor of a
united German state. When the words ‘‘Long live His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor William!’’ rang out, the assembled guests took up
the cry. One participant wrote, ‘‘A thundering cheer, repeated at
least six times, thrilled through the room while the flags and standards waved over the head of the new emperor of Germany.’’ European rulers who feared the power of the new German state were not
so cheerful. ‘‘The balance of power has been entirely destroyed,’’
declared the British prime minister.

The France of Napoleon III
Q Focus Question: What were the characteristics of
Napoleon III’s government, and how did his foreign
policy contribute to the unification of Italy and
Germany?
After 1850, a new generation of conservative leaders came to
power in Europe. Foremost among them was Napoleon III
(1852--1870) of France, who taught his contemporaries
how authoritarian governments could use liberal and nationalistic forces to bolster their own power. It was a lesson
others quickly learned.
Louis Napoleon: Toward the Second Empire
Even after his election as the president of the French
Republic, many of his contemporaries dismissed ‘‘Napoleon the Small’’ as a nonentity whose success was due only
to his name. But Louis Napoleon was a clever politician
who was especially astute at understanding the popular
forces of his day. After his election, he was at least clear
about his desire to have personal power. He wrote, ‘‘I shall
never submit to any attempt to influence me.. . . I follow
only the promptings of my mind and heart. . . . Nothing,
nothing shall trouble the clear vision of my judgment or
the strength of my resolution.’’1
Louis Napoleon was a patient man. For three years,
he persevered in winning the support of the French
people, and when the National Assembly rejected his wish
to be allowed to stand for reelection, Louis used troops to
seize control of the government on December 1, 1851.
After reinstating universal male suffrage, Napoleon asked
the French people to restore the empire. Ninety-seven
percent responded affirmatively, and on December 2, 1852,
Louis Napoleon assumed the title of Napoleon III (the first
Napoleon had abdicated in favor of his son, Napoleon II,
on April 6, 1814). The Second Empire had begun.
The Second Napoleonic Empire
The government of Napoleon III was clearly authoritarian
in a Bonapartist sense. As chief of state, Napoleon III
controlled the armed forces, police, and civil service. Only
he could introduce legislation and declare war. The Legislative Corps gave an appearance of representative government, in that its members were elected by universal
male suffrage to six-year terms, but they could neither
initiate legislation nor affect the budget.
The first five years of Napoleon III’s reign were a
spectacular success as he reaped the benefits of worldwide
economic prosperity as well as some of his own economic
policies. Napoleon believed in using the resources of government to stimulate the national economy and took many
steps to expand industrial growth. Government subsidies
were used to foster the construction of railroads, harbors,
roads, and canals. The major French railway lines were
completed during Napoleon’s reign, and industrial expansion was evident in the tripling of iron production. Napoleon III also undertook a vast reconstruction of the city
of Paris. The medieval Paris of narrow streets and old city
walls was replaced by a modern Paris of broad boulevards,
spacious buildings, public squares, an underground sewage
system, a new public water supply, and gaslights. The new
Paris served a military as well as an aesthetic purpose.
Broad streets made it more difficult for would-be insurrectionists to throw up barricades and easier for troops
to move rapidly through the city to put down revolts.
In the 1860s, as opposition to some of his policies
began to mount, Napoleon III liberalized his regime. He
reached out to the working class by legalizing trade unions and granting them the right to strike. He also began
to open up the political process. The Legislative Corps
was permitted more say in affairs of state, including debate over the budget. Liberalization policies did serve
initially to strengthen the hand of the government. In a
plebiscite in May 1870 on whether to accept a new constitution that might have inaugurated a parliamentary
regime, the French people gave Napoleon another resounding victory. This triumph was short-lived, however.
Foreign policy failures led to growing criticism, and war
with Prussia in 1870 turned out to be the death blow for
Napoleon III’s regime. Napoleon was ousted, and the
Third Republic was proclaimed.
Foreign Policy: The Mexican Adventure
The most flagrant of Napoleon III’s foreign policy failures
was his imperialistic adventure in Mexico. Seeking to
dominate Mexican markets for
French goods, the emperor in 1861
sent French troops to Mexico,
where British and Spanish forces
were already embroiled in a clash
between liberal and conservative
factions. Although the British and
Spanish withdrew their troops after
order had been restored, French
forces remained, and in 1864,
Napoleon III installed Archduke
Maximilian of Austria, his handpicked choice, as the new emperor
of Mexico. When the French troops
were needed in Europe, however,
Maximilian became an emperor without an army. He
surrendered to Mexican forces in May 1867 and was executed weeks later. His execution was a blow to the
prestige of the French emperor.
Foreign Policy: The Crimean War
Napoleon III’s participation in the Crimean War (1854--
1856) had been more rewarding. As heir to the Napoleonic
empire, Napoleon III was motivated by the desire to free
France from the restrictions of the peace settlements of
1814--1815 and to make France the chief arbiter of Europe.
The Ottoman Empire The Crimean War was yet another
attempt to answer the Eastern Question: Who would be
the chief beneficiaries of the disintegration of the Ottoman
Empire? In the seventeenth century, the Ottoman Empire
had control of southeastern Europe but in 1699 had lost
Hungary, Transylvania, Croatia, and Slovenia to the expanding Austrian Empire. The Russian Empire to its north
also encroached on the Ottoman Empire by seizing the
Crimea in 1783 and Bessarabia in 1812.
By the beginning of the nineteenth century, the
Ottoman Empire had entered a fresh period of decline.
Nationalist revolts led to the creation of an independent
Serbia in 1817 and a free Greece in 1830. The Russians
gained a protectorate over the Danubian provinces of
Moldavia and Wallachia in 1829.
War in the Crimea As Ottoman authority over the
outlying territories in southeastern Europe waned, European governments began to take an active interest in
the empire’s apparent demise. Russia’s proximity to the
Ottoman Empire naturally gave it special opportunities to
enlarge its sphere of influence. In 1853, the Russians demanded the right to protect Christian shrines in Palestine,
a privilege that had already been extended to the French.
When the Ottomans refused, the Russians invaded Ottoman Moldavia and Wallachia. Failure to resolve the dispute by
negotiations led the Turks to declare
war on Russia on October 4, 1853.
The following year, on March 28,
Great Britain and France, fearful of
Russian gains at the expense of the
disintegrating Ottoman Empire, declared war on Russia.
The Crimean War was poorly
planned and poorly fought. Britain
and France decided to attack Russia’s
Crimean peninsula in the Black Sea.
After a long siege and at a terrible
cost in lives for all combatants, the
main Russian fortress of Sevastopol fell in September 1855,
and the Russians soon sued for peace. By the Treaty of Paris,
signed in March 1856, Russia was forced to give up
Bessarabia and accept the neutrality of the Black Sea. In
addition, Moldavia and Wallachia were placed under the
protection of all five great powers.
The Crimean War proved costly to both sides. More
than 250,000 soldiers died in the war, 60 percent of the
deaths coming from disease (especially cholera). Even
more would have died on the British side had it not been
for the efforts of the nurse Florence Nightingale (1820--
1910). Her insistence on strict sanitary conditions saved
many lives and helped make nursing a profession of
trained, middle-class women.
The Crimean War broke up long-standing European
power relationships and effectively destroyed the Concert of
Europe. Austria and Russia, the two chief powers maintaining the status quo in the first half of the nineteenth
century, were now enemies because of Austria’s unwillingness to support Russia in the war. Russia, defeated, humiliated, and weakened by the obvious failure of its armies,
withdrew from European affairs for the next two decades to
set its house in order. Great Britain, disillusioned by its role
in the war, also pulled back from Continental affairs.
Austria, paying the price for its neutrality, was now without
friends among the great powers. Not until the 1870s were
new combinations formed to replace those that had disappeared, and in the meantime, the European international
situation remained fluid. It was this new situation that
made the unification of Italy and Germany possible.
National Unification: Italy
and Germany
Q Focus Question: What actions did Cavour and
Bismarck take to bring about unification in Italy and
Germany, respectively, and what role did war play in
their efforts?
The breakdown of the Concert of Europe opened the way
for the Italians and the Germans to establish national states.
Their successful unification transformed the power structure
of the Continent. Well into the twentieth century, Europe
and the world would still be dealing with the consequences.
The Unification of Italy
In 1850, Austria was still the dominant power on the
Italian peninsula. After the failure of the revolution of
1848--1849, a growing number of
advocates for Italian unification focused on the northern Italian state
of Piedmont as their best hope to
achieve their goal. The royal house
of Savoy ruled the kingdom of
Piedmont, which also included the
island of Sardinia (see Map 22.1).
The little state seemed unlikely to
supply the needed leadership to unify
Italy, however, until King Victor
Emmanuel II (1849--1878) selected
Count Camillo di Cavour (1810--
1861) as his prime minister in 1852.
The Leadership of Cavour Cavour
was a consummate politician with
the ability to persuade others of the
rightness of his own convictions. As
prime minister, he pursued a policy
of economic expansion that increased government revenues and
enabled him to pour money into
equipping a large army. Cavour,
however, had no illusions about
Piedmont’s military strength and was
well aware that he could not challenge Austria directly. Consequently,
he made an alliance in 1858 with the French emperor Louis
Napoleon and then provoked the Austrians into invading
Piedmont in 1859. In the initial stages of fighting, the
Austrians were defeated in two major battles by mostly
French armies. A peace settlement gave the French Nice
and Savoy, which they had been promised for making the
alliance, and awarded Lombardy to Cavour and the Piedmontese. More important, however, Cavour’s success
caused nationalists in the northern Italian states of Parma,
Modena, and Tuscany to overthrow their governments and
join their states to Piedmont.
The Efforts of Garibaldi Meanwhile, in southern Italy, a
new leader of Italian unification had come to the fore.
Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807--1882), a dedicated Italian
patriot, raised an army of a thousand Red Shirts, as his volunteers
were called because of their distinctive dress, and landed in Sicily,
where a revolt had broken out
against the Bourbon king of the Two
Sicilies. By the end of July 1860,
most of Sicily had been pacified
under Garibaldi’s control. In August,
Garibaldi and his forces crossed
over to the mainland and began a
victorious march up the Italian
peninsula. Naples and the Two Sicilies fell in early September. Ever
the patriot, Garibaldi chose to turn
over his conquests to Cavour’s
Piedmontese forces. On March 17,
1861, the new kingdom of Italy was
proclaimed under a centralized
government subordinated to the
control of Piedmont and King Victor Emmanuel II of the house of
Savoy. Worn out by his efforts,
Cavour died three months later.
Despite the proclamation of the
new kingdom, unification was not
yet complete because Venetia in the
north was still held by Austria and
Rome remained under papal control, supported by French troops. To
attack either one meant war with a
major European state, which the
Italian army was not prepared to
handle. It was the Prussian army
that indirectly completed the task of
Italian unification. In the AustroPrussian War of 1866, the new
Italian state became an ally of
Prussia. Although the Italian army was defeated by the
Austrians, Prussia’s victory left the Italians with Venetia.
In 1870, the Franco-Prussian War resulted in the withdrawal of French troops from Rome. The Italian army
then annexed the city on September 20, 1870, and Rome
became the new capital of the united Italian state.
The Unification of Germany
After the failure of the Frankfurt Assembly to achieve
German unification in 1848--1849, German nationalists
focused on Austria and Prussia as the only two states
powerful enough to unify Germany. But Austria, a large
multinational empire, feared the creation of a strong
German state in central Europe, and more and more
Germans began to look to Prussia for leadership in the
cause of German unification.
Bismarck In the 1860s, King William I (1861--1888) attempted to enlarge and strengthen the Prussian army.
When the Prussian legislature refused to levy new taxes for
the proposed military changes in March 1862, William
appointed a new prime minister, Count Otto von Bismarck
(1815--1898). Bismarck ignored the legislative opposition to
the military reforms, arguing that ‘‘Germany does not look
to Prussia’s liberalism but to her power. . . . Not by speeches
and majorities will the great questions of the day be
decided---that was the mistake of 1848--1849---but by iron
and blood.’’2 Bismarck collected the taxes and reorganized
the army anyway. From 1862 to 1866, Bismarck governed
Prussia by simply ignoring parliament. Unwilling to revolt,
parliament did nothing. In the meantime, opposition to his
domestic policy set Bismarck on an active foreign policy,
which led to war and German unification.
Because Bismarck succeeded in guiding Prussia’s unification of Germany, it is often assumed that he had intentionally pursued a course of action that led to that goal,
but that is hardly the case. Bismarck was an opportunist. He
was not a political gambler but rather a moderate who
waged war only when all other diplomatic alternatives had
been exhausted and when he was reasonably sure that all the
military and diplomatic advantages were on his side. Bismarck has often been portrayed as the ultimate realist, the
foremost nineteenth-century practitioner of Realpolitik. He
was also quite open about his strong dislike of anyone who
opposed him. He said one morning to his wife, ‘‘I could not
sleep the whole night; I hated throughout the whole night.’’
The Danish War (1864) Bismarck’s first war was against
Denmark, fought over the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. Bismarck persuaded the Austrians to join Prussia in
declaring war on Denmark on February 1, 1864. The
Danes were quickly defeated and surrendered Schleswig
and Holstein to the victors (see Map 22.2). Austria and
Prussia then agreed to divide the administration of the two
duchies; Prussia took Schleswig while Austria administered
Holstein. But Bismarck used the joint administration of
the two duchies to create friction with the Austrians and
goad them into a war on June 14, 1866.
The Austro-Prussian War (1866) Many Europeans
expected a quick Austrian victory, but they overlooked
the effectiveness of the Prussian military reforms of the
1860s. The Prussian breech-loading needle gun had a
much faster rate of fire than the Austrian muzzle-loader,
and a superior network of railroads enabled the Prussians
to mass troops quickly. At Ko¨niggra¨tz (Sadowa) on July 3,
the Austrian army was defeated. Austria was now excluded from German affairs, and the German states north
of the Main River were organized into a northern German confederation controlled by Prussia. The southern
German states, largely Catholic, in contrast to the Protestant north, remained independent but were coerced
into signing military agreements with Prussia.
The Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871) Bismarck and
William I had achieved a major goal by 1866. Prussia now
dominated all of northern Germany, and Austria had
been excluded from any significant role in German affairs.
Nevertheless, unsettled business led to new international
complications and further change. Bismarck realized that
France would never be content with a strong German state
to its east because of the potential threat to French security. At the same time, after a series of setbacks, Napoleon
III, the French ruler, needed a diplomatic triumph to
offset his serious domestic problems. The French were not
happy with the turn of events in Germany and looked for
opportunities to humiliate the Prussians.
In 1870, Prussia and France became embroiled in a
dispute over the candidacy of a relative of the Prussian
king for the throne of Spain. Bismarck manipulated the
misunderstandings between the French and Prussians to
goad the French into declaring war on Prussia on July 15,
1870 (see the box on p. 470). The French proved no
match for the better-led and better-organized Prussian
forces. The southern German states honored their military alliances with Prussia and joined the war effort
against the French. The Prussian armies advanced into
France, and at Sedan, on September 2, 1870, an entire
French army and Napoleon III himself were captured.
Paris finally capitulated on January 28, 1871, and an
official peace treaty was signed in May. France had to pay
an indemnity of 5 billion francs (about $1 billion) and
give up the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine to the new
German state, a loss that angered the French and left
them burning for revenge.
Even before the war had ended, the southern German
states had agreed to enter the North German Confederation. On January 18, 1871, in the Hall of Mirrors in
Louis XIV’s palace at Versailles, William I, with Bismarck
standing at the foot of the throne, was proclaimed kaiser
or emperor of the Second German Empire (the first was
the medieval Holy Roman Empire). German unity had
been achieved by the Prussian monarchy and the Prussian
army. In a real sense, Germany had been merged into
Prussia, not Prussia into Germany. German liberals also
rejoiced. They had dreamed of unity and freedom, but the
achievement of unity now seemed much more important.
One old liberal proclaimed:
I cannot shake off the impression of this hour. I am no
devotee of Mars; I feel more attached to the goddess of
beauty and the mother of graces than to the powerful god
of war, but the trophies of war exercise a magic charm even
upon the child of peace. One’s view is involuntarily chained
and one’s spirit goes along with the boundless row of men
who acclaim the god of the moment---success.3
The Prussian leadership of German unification meant the
triumph of authoritarian, militaristic values over liberal,
constitutional sentiments in the development of the new
German state. With its industrial resources and military
might, the new state had become the strongest power on
the Continent. A new European balance of power was at
hand.
Nation Building and Reform:
The National State in
Mid-Century
Q Focus Question: What efforts for reform occurred in
the Austrian Empire, Russia, and Great Britain
between 1850 and 1870, and how successful were they
in alleviating each nation’s problems?
While European affairs were dominated by the unification
of Italy and Germany, other states in the Western world
were also undergoing transformations (see Map 22.3).
War, civil war, and changing political alignments served as
catalysts for domestic reforms.
The Austrian Empire: Toward a Dual Monarchy
After crushing the revolutions of 1848--1849, the Habsburgs restored centralized, autocratic government to their
empire. But failure in war led to severe internal consequences for Austria. Defeat at the hands of the Prussians
in 1866 forced the Austrians to deal with the fiercely
nationalistic Hungarians. The result was the negotiated
Ausgleich, or Compromise, of 1867, which created the
Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary. Each part of the
empire now had its own constitution, its own bicameral
legislature, its own governmental machinery for domestic
affairs, and its own capital (Vienna for Austria and Buda,
which soon merged with the city of Pest to become Budapest, for Hungary). Holding the two states together
were a single monarch (Francis Joseph was emperor of
Austria and king of Hungary) and a common army,
foreign policy, and system of finances. In domestic affairs,
the Hungarians had become an independent nation. The
Ausgleich did not, however, satisfy the other nationalities
that made up the multinational Austro-Hungarian
Empire (see Map 22.4). The Dual Monarchy simply enabled the German-speaking Austrians and Hungarian
Magyars to dominate the minorities, especially the Slavs,
in their respective states. As the Hungarian nationalist
Louis Kossuth remarked, ‘‘Dualism is the alliance of the
conservative, reactionary and any apparently liberal elements in Hungary with those of the Austrian Germans
who despise liberty, for the oppression of the other nationalities and races.’’4
Imperial Russia
The defeat in the Crimean War in 1856 at the hands of
the British and French revealed the blatant deficiencies
behind the facade of absolute power and made it clear
even to staunch conservatives that Russia was falling
hopelessly behind the western European powers. Tsar
Alexander II (1855--1881) turned his energies to a serious
overhaul of the Russian system.
Serfdom was the most burdensome problem in tsarist
Russia. The continuing subjugation of millions of peasants
to the land and their landlords was an obviously corrupt
and failing system. On March 3, 1861, Alexander issued his
emancipation edict (see the box on p. 473). Peasants could
now own property, marry as they chose, and bring suits in
the law courts. Nevertheless, the benefits of emancipation
were limited. The government provided land for the
peasants by purchasing it from the landlords, but the
landowners often chose to keep the best parcels. The Russian peasants soon found that they had inadequate
amounts of good arable land to support themselves, a situation that worsened as the peasant population increased
rapidly in the second half of the nineteenth century.
Nor were the peasants completely free. The state
compensated the landowners for the land given to the
peasants, but the peasants, in turn, were expected to repay
the state in long-term installments. To ensure that the
payments were made, peasants were subjected to the
authority of their mir, or village commune, which was
collectively responsible for the land payments to the
government. In a very real sense, then, the village commune, not the individual peasants, owned the land the
peasants were purchasing. And since the village communes were responsible for the payments, they were
reluctant to allow peasants to leave their land.
Emancipation, then, led not to a free, landowning peasantry along the Western model but to an unhappy,
land-starved peasantry that largely followed the old ways
of farming.
Alexander II also attempted other reforms. In 1864,
he instituted a system of zemstvos, or local assemblies,
that provided a moderate degree of self-government.
Zemstvos were given limited power to provide public
services, such as education, famine relief, and road and
bridge maintenance. They could levy taxes for these
services, but their efforts were frequently disrupted by
bureaucrats who feared any hint of self-government. The
legal reforms of 1864, which created a regular system of
local and provincial courts and a judicial code that accepted the principle of equality before the law, proved
successful, however.
Even the autocratic tsar was unable to control the
forces he unleashed by his reform program. Reformers
wanted more and rapid change; conservatives opposed
what they perceived as the tsar’s attempts to undermine
the basic institutions of Russian society. By 1870, Russia
was witnessing increasing levels of dissatisfaction. When
one group of radicals assassinated Alexander II in 1881,
his son and successor, Alexander III (1881--1894), turned
against reform and returned to the traditional methods of
repression.
Great Britain: The Victorian Age
Like Russia, Britain avoided revolutionary disturbances in
1848, although for quite different reasons. The Reform
Act of 1832 had opened the door to political representation for the industrial middle class, ushering in a period
of general contentment and stability, and in the 1860s,
Britain’s liberal parliamentary system demonstrated once
again its ability to make both social and political reforms
that kept the country stable and prosperous.
One of the reasons for Britain’s stability was its continuing economic growth. After 1850, middle-class prosperity was at last coupled with some improvements for the
working classes. Real wages for laborers increased more
than 25 percent between 1850 and 1870. The British
feeling of national pride was well reflected in Queen
Victoria, whose reign from 1837 to 1901 was the longest in
English history. Victoria had nine children and, when she
died at age eighty-one, thirty-seven great-grandchildren.
Her sense of duty and moral respectability reflected
the attitudes of her age, which has
ever since been known as the Victorian Age.
Politically, this was an era of
somewhat uneasy stability as the
aristocratic and upper-middle-class
representatives who dominated
Parliament blurred party lines by
their internal strife and shifting
positions. One important issue was
the extension of voting rights. The
Tory (Conservative Party) leader
in Parliament, Benjamin Disraeli
(1804--1881), became a supporter of
voting reform, primarily because he
thought he could win over the
newly enfranchised groups to his
party. The Reform Act of 1867 was
an important step toward the democratization of Britain. By lowering the monetary requirements for
voting (taxes paid or income
earned), it enfranchised many male urban workers. The
number of voters increased from about one million to
slightly over two million (see Table 22.1). Although Disraeli believed that this would benefit the Conservatives,
industrial workers helped produce a huge Liberal victory
in 1868.
The United States: Slavery and War
By the mid-nineteenth century, American national unity
was increasingly threatened by the issue of slavery. Like
the North, the South had grown dramatically in population during the first half of the nineteenth century. But
its development was quite different. Its cotton economy
and social structure were based on the exploitation of
enslaved black Africans and their descendants. The importance of cotton is evident from production figures. In
1810, the South produced a raw cotton crop of 178,000
bales worth $10 million. By 1860, it was generating 4.5
million bales of cotton with a value of $249 million.
Ninety-three percent of southern cotton in 1850 was
produced by a slave population that had grown dramatically in fifty years. Although new slave imports had been
barred in 1808, there were four million African American
slaves in the South by 1860, four times the number in
1800. The cotton economy and plantation-based slavery
were intimately related, and the attempt to maintain
them in the first half of the nineteenth century led the
South to become increasingly defensive, monolithic,
and isolated. At the same time, the growth of an abolitionist movement in the North challenged the southern
order and created an ‘‘emotional chain reaction’’ that led
to civil war.
As polarization over the issue of slavery intensified,
compromise became less feasible. When Abraham Lincoln, the man who had said in a speech in Illinois in
1858 that ‘‘this government cannot endure permanently
half slave and half free,’’ was elected president in
November 1860, the die was cast. Lincoln carried only 2
of the 1,109 counties in the South; the Republicans were
not even on the ballot in ten southern states. On
December 20, 1860, a South Carolina convention voted
to repeal ratification of the Constitution of the United
States. In February 1861, six more southern states did
the same, and a rival nation---the Confederate States of
America---was formed. In March, fighting erupted between North and South.
The Civil War The American Civil War (1861--1865)
was an extraordinarily bloody struggle. More than
600,000 soldiers died, either in battle or from deadly infectious diseases spawned by filthy camp conditions. Over
a period of four years, the Union states of the North
mobilized their superior assets and gradually wore down
the Confederate forces of the South. As the war dragged
on, it had the effect of radicalizing public opinion in the
North. What began as a war to save the Union became a
war against slavery. On January 1, 1863, Lincoln’s
Emancipation Proclamation made most of the nation’s
slaves ‘‘forever free’’ (see the box on p. 473). An increasingly effective Union blockade of the South combined
with a shortage of fighting men made the Confederate
cause desperate by the end of 1864. The final push of
Union troops under General Ulysses S. Grant forced
General Robert E. Lee’s Confederate army to surrender on
April 9, 1865. Although problems lay ahead, the Union
victory confirmed that the United States would be ‘‘one
nation, indivisible.’’
The Emergence of a Canadian Nation
Nation building was also taking place to the north of the
United States. By the Treaty of Paris in 1763, Canada---or
New France, as it was called---passed into the hands of the
British. By 1800, most Canadians favored more autonomy, although the colonists disagreed on the form this
autonomy should take. Upper Canada (now Ontario) was
predominantly English-speaking, while Lower Canada
(now Quebec) was dominated by French Canadians. Increased immigration to Canada after 1815 also fueled the
desire for self-government.
In 1837, a number of Canadian groups rose in rebellion against British authority. Rebels in Lower Canada
demanded separation from Britain, creation of a republic,
universal male suffrage, and freedom of the press. Although the rebellions were crushed by the following year,
the British government now began to seek ways to satisfy
some of the Canadian demands. The American Civil War
proved to be a turning point. Fearful of U.S. designs on
Canada during the war and eager to reduce the costs of
maintaining the colonies, the British government finally
capitulated to Canadian demands. In 1867, Parliament established the Canadian nation---the Dominion of Canada---
with its own constitution. Canada now possessed a
parliamentary system and ruled itself, although foreign
affairs still remained under the control of the British
government.
Industrialization and the Marxist
Response
Q Focus Question: What were the main ideas of
Karl Marx?
Between 1850 and 1871, Continental industrialization came
of age. The innovations of the British Industrial Revolution---
mechanized factory production, the use of coal, the steam
engine, and the transportation revolution---all became regular features of economic expansion. Although marred periodically by economic depression (1857--1858) or recession
(1866--1867), this was an age of considerable economic
prosperity, particularly evident in the growth of domestic
and foreign markets.
Before 1870, capitalist factory owners remained
largely free to hire labor on their own terms based on
market forces. Although workers formed trade unions as
organizations that would fight for improved working
conditions and reasonable wages, they tended to represent only a small part of the industrial working class and
proved largely ineffective. Real change for the industrial
proletariat would come only with the development of
socialist parties and socialist trade unions. These emerged
after 1870, but the theory that made them possible had
already been developed by mid-century in the work of
Karl Marx.
Marx and Marxism
The beginnings of Marxism can be traced to the 1848
publication of a short treatise titled The Communist
Manifesto, written by two Germans, Karl Marx (1818--
1883) and Friedrich Engels (1820--1895). It became one
of the most influential political treatises in world history.
Marx and Engels began their treatise with the statement that ‘‘the history of all hitherto existing society is
the history of class struggles.’’ Throughout history, oppressed and oppressor have ‘‘stood in constant opposition
to one another.’’ In an earlier struggle, the feudal classes of
the Middle Ages were forced to accede to the emerging
middle class or bourgeoisie. As the bourgeoisie took
control in turn, its ideas became the dominant views of
the era, and government became its instrument. Marx
and Engels declared, ‘‘The executive of the modern State
is but a committee for managing the common affairs of
the whole bourgeoisie.’’5 In other words, the government
of the state reflected and defended the interests of the
industrial middle class and its allies.
Although bourgeois society had emerged victorious
out of the ruins of feudal society, Marx and Engels insisted that it had not triumphed completely. Now once
again the bourgeois were antagonists in an emerging class
struggle, but this time they faced the proletariat, or the
industrial working class. The struggle would be fierce; in
fact, Marx and Engels predicted that the workers would
eventually overthrow their bourgeois masters. After their
victory, the proletariat would form a dictatorship to reorganize the means of production. Then a classless society
would emerge, and the state---itself an instrument of the
bourgeoisie---would wither away, since it no longer represented the interests of a particular class. Class struggles
would be over (see the box above). Marx believed that the
emergence of a classless society would lead to progress in
science, technology, and industry and to greater wealth
for all.
After the failure of the revolutions of 1848, Marx
went to London, where he spent the rest of his life. He
continued his writing on political economy, especially
his famous work Das Kapital (Capital), but his own
preoccupation with organizing the working-class movement kept Marx from ever finishing the book. In The
Communist Manifesto, Marx had defined the communists as ‘‘the most advanced and resolute section of the
working-class parties of every country.’’ Their advantage
was their ability to understand ‘‘the line of march, the
conditions, and the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement.’’6 Marx viewed his role in this light
and participated enthusiastically in the activities of the
International Working Men’s Association. Formed in
1864 by British and French trade unionists, this so-called
First International served as an umbrella organization for
working-class interests. Marx was the dominant personality on the International’s General Council and devoted
much time to its activities. Internal dissension, however,
soon crippled the organization, and it failed in 1872.
Although it would be revived in 1889, the fate of socialism by that time was in the hands of national socialist
parties.
Science and Culture in an Age
of Realism
Q Focus Question: How did the belief that the world
should be viewed realistically manifest itself in science,
art, and literature in the second half of the nineteenth
century?
Between 1850 and 1870, two major intellectual developments were evident: the growth of scientific knowledge,
with its rapidly increasing impact on the Western
worldview, and the shift from Romanticism, with its
emphasis on the inner world of reality, to Realism, with
its focus on the outer, material world.
A New Age of Science
By the mid-nineteenth century, science was having an
ever-greater impact on European life. The Scientific
Revolution of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries had
fundamentally transformed the Western worldview and
fostered a modern, rational approach to the study of the
natural world. Even in the eighteenth century, however,
these intellectual developments had remained the preserve of an educated elite and resulted in few practical
benefits. Moreover, the technical advances of the early
Industrial Revolution had depended little on pure science
and much more on the practical experiments of technologically oriented amateur inventors. Advances in industrial technology, however, fed an interest in basic scientific
research, which from the 1830s on resulted in a rash of
basic scientific discoveries that were soon transformed into
technological improvements that affected all Europeans.
The development of the steam engine was important
in encouraging scientists to work out its theoretical
foundations, a preoccupation that led to the study of
thermodynamics, the science of the relationship between
heat and mechanical energy. The laws of thermodynamics
were at the core of nineteenth-century physics. In biology,
the Frenchman Louis Pasteur (1822--1895) postulated the
germ theory of disease, which had enormous practical
applications in the development of modern, scientific
medical practices. In chemistry, the Russian Dmitri
Mendeleyev (1834--1907) in the 1860s classified all the
material elements then known on the basis of their atomic
weights and provided the systematic foundation for the
periodic law. The Briton Michael Faraday (1791--1867)
discovered the phenomenon of electromagnetic induction
and put together a primitive generator that laid the
groundwork for the use of electricity, although economically efficient generators were not built until the 1870s.
The steadily increasing and often dramatic material
benefits generated by science and technology led Europeans
to a growing faith in the benefits of science. The popularity
of scientific and technological achievements produced a
widespread acceptance of the scientific method, based on
observation, experiment, and logical analysis, as the only
path to objective truth and objective reality. This, in turn,
undermined the faith of many people in religious revelation
and truth. It is no accident that the nineteenth century was
an age of increasing secularization, particularly evident in
the growth of materialism, the belief that everything
mental, spiritual, or ideal was simply a result of physical
forces. Truth was to be found in the concrete material existence of human beings, not, as the Romantics imagined,
in revelations gained by feeling or intuitive flashes. The
importance of materialism was strikingly evident in the
most important scientific event of the nineteenth century,
the development of the theory of organic evolution according to natural selection. On the theories of Charles
Darwin could be built a picture of humans as material
beings that were simply part of the natural world.
Charles Darwin and the Theory
of Organic Evolution
In 1859, Charles Darwin (1809--1882) published his celebrated book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural
Selection. The basic idea of this book was that all plants and
animals had evolved over a long period of time from
earlier and simpler forms of life, a principle known as
organic evolution. Darwin was important in explaining
how this natural process worked. In every species, he argued, ‘‘many more individuals of each species are born
than can possibly survive.’’ This results in a ‘‘struggle for
existence’’: ‘‘As more individuals are produced than can
possibly survive, there must in every case be a struggle for
existence, either one individual with another of the same
species, or with the individuals of distinct species, or with
the physical conditions of life.’’ Those who succeeded in
this struggle for existence had adapted better to their environment, a process made possible by the appearance of
‘‘variants.’’ Chance variations that occurred in the process
of inheritance enabled some organisms to be more adaptable to the environment than others, a process that Darwin
called natural selection: ‘‘Owing to this struggle [for existence], variations, however slight. . ., if they be in any degree
profitable to the individuals of a species, in their infinitely
complex relations to other organic beings and to their
physical conditions of life, will tend to the preservation of
such individuals, and will generally be inherited by the
offspring.’’7 Those that were naturally selected for survival
(‘‘survival of the fit’’) survived. The unfit did not and became extinct. The fit who survived, in turn, propagated and
passed on the variations that enabled them to survive until,
from Darwin’s point of view, a separate species emerged.
In On the Origin of Species, Darwin discussed plant
and animal species only. He was not concerned with
human beings and only later applied his theory of natural
selection to humans. In The Descent of Man, published in
1871, he argued for the animal origins of human beings:
‘‘Man is the co-descendant with other mammals of a
common progenitor.’’ Humans were not an exception to
the rule governing other species.
Darwin’s ideas were controversial at first. Some people
fretted that Darwin’s theory made humans ordinary products of nature rather than unique beings. Others were disturbed by the implications of life as a struggle for survival, of
‘‘nature red in tooth and claw.’’ Was there a place in the
Darwinian world for moral values? For those who believed in
a rational order in the world, Darwin’s theory seemed to
eliminate purpose and design from the universe. Gradually,
however, Darwin’s theory was accepted by scientists and
other intellectuals. In the process of accepting Darwin’s ideas,
some people even tried to apply them to society, yet another
example of the increasing prestige of the scientific approach.
Realism in Literature
The belief that the world should be viewed realistically,
frequently expressed after 1850, was closely related to the
materialistic outlook. The term Realism was first employed in 1850 to describe a new style of painting and
soon spread to literature.
The literary Realists of the mid-nineteenth century were
distinguished by their deliberate rejection of Romanticism.
The literary Realists wanted to deal with ordinary characters
from actual life rather than Romantic heroes in unusual
settings. They also sought to avoid flowery and sentimental
language by using careful observation and accurate description, an approach that led them to eschew poetry in
favor of prose, primarily in the form of the novel. Realists
often combined their interest in everyday life with a
searching examination of social questions.
The leading fiction writer of the 1850s and 1860s, the
Frenchman Gustave Flaubert (1821--1880), perfected the
Realist novel. His Madame Bovary (1857) was a straightforward description of barren and sordid provincial life in
France. Emma Bovary, a woman of some vitality, is trapped in a marriage to a drab provincial doctor. Impelled by
the images of romantic love she has read about in novels,
she seeks the same thing for herself in adulterous affairs.
Unfulfilled, she is ultimately driven to suicide, unrepentant
to the end for her lifestyle. Flaubert’s contempt for bourgeois society was evident in his portrayal of middle-class
hypocrisy and smugness.
William Thackeray (1811--1863) wrote the prototypical Realist novel in Britain: Vanity Fair, published in
1848. Subtitled A Novel Without a Hero, the book deliberately flaunted Romantic conventions. A novel, Thackeray said, should ‘‘convey as strongly as possible the
sentiment of reality as opposed to a tragedy or poem,
which may be heroical.’’ Perhaps the greatest of the Victorian novelists was Charles Dickens (1812--1870), whose
realistic novels focusing on the lower and middle classes
in Britain’s early industrial age became extraordinarily
popular. His descriptions of the urban poor and the
brutalization of human life were vividly realistic (see the
box on p. 479).
Realism in Art
In art, Realism became dominant after 1850, although
Romanticism was by no means dead. Among the most
important characteristics of Realism are a desire to depict
the everyday life of ordinary people, whether peasants,
workers, or prostitutes; an attempt at photographic
realism; and an interest in the natural environment. The
French became leaders in Realist painting.
Gustave Courbet (1819--1877) was the most famous
artist of the Realist school. In fact, the term Realism was
first applied to one of his paintings. Courbet reveled in a
straightforward portrayal of everyday life. His subjects
were factory workers, peasants, and the wives of saloon
keepers. ‘‘I have never seen either angels or goddesses, so I
am not interested in painting them,’’ he exclaimed. One of
his famous works, The Stonebreakers, painted in 1849,
shows two men engaged in the exhausting work of
breaking stones to build a road. This representation of
human misery was a scandal to those who objected to his
‘‘cult of ugliness.’’ To Courbet, no subject was too ordinary, too harsh, or too ugly.
Jean-Franc¸ois Millet (1814--1875) was preoccupied
with scenes from rural life, especially peasants laboring in
the fields, although his Realism still contained an element
of Romantic sentimentality. In The Gleaners, Millet’s most
famous work, three peasant women gather grain in a
field, a centuries-old practice that for Millet showed the
symbiotic relationship between humans and nature.
Millet made landscapes and country life important subjects for French artists, but he too was criticized by his
contemporaries for crude subject matter and unorthodox
technique.
CONCLUSION
Between 1850 and 1871, the national state became the focus of
people’s loyalty. Wars, both foreign and civil, were fought to create
unified nation-states. Political nationalism had emerged during
the French revolutionary era and had become a powerful force of
change during the first half of the nineteenth century, but its
triumph came only after 1850. Tied initially to middle-class
liberals, by the end of the nineteenth century it would have great
appeal to the broad masses as well. In 1871, however, the political
transformations stimulated by the force for nationalism were
incomplete. Large minorities, especially in the polyglot empires
controlled by the Austrians, Ottoman Turks, and Russians, had not
achieved the goal of their own national states. Moreover, the
nationalism that had triumphed by 1871 was no longer the
nationalism that had been closely identified with liberalism.
Liberal nationalists had believed that unified nation-states would
preserve individual rights and lead to a greater community of
peoples. Rather than unifying people, however, the loud and
chauvinistic nationalism of the late nineteenth century divided
them as the new national states became embroiled in bitter
competition after 1871.
Europeans, however, were hardly aware of nationalism’s
dangers in 1871. The spread of industrialization and the wealth of
scientific and technological achievements were sources of optimism.
After the revolutionary and military upheavals of the mid-century
decades, many Europeans believed that they stood on the verge of a
new age of progress.
