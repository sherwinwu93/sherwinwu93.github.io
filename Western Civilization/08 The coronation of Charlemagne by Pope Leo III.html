<h2 id="orga60bfa7">The coronation of Charlemagne by Pope Leo III</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga60bfa7">
<p class="verse">
In 800, Charlemagne, the king of the Franks, journeyed to Rome to help Pope Leo III,<br />
&#xa0;who was barely clinging to power in the face of rebellious Romans.<br />
On Christmas Day, Charlemagne and his family,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;attended by Romans, Franks, and even visitors from the Byzantine Empire,<br />
&#xa0;crowded into Saint Peter’s Basilica to hear Mass.<br />
Quite unexpectedly, at least according to a Frankish writer,<br />
&#xa0;'as the king rose from praying before the tomb of the blessed apostle Peter,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;Pope Leo placed a golden crown on his head.'<br />
In keeping with ancient tradition, the people in the church shouted,<br />
&#xa0;'Long life and victory to Charles Augustus,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;crowned by God the great and pacific Emperor of the Romans.'<br />
Seemingly, the Roman Empire in the West had been reborn,<br />
&#xa0;and Charles had become the first western emperor since 476.<br />
But this 'Roman emperor' was actually a German king,<br />
&#xa0;and he had been crowned by the head of the western Christian church.<br />
In truth,<br />
&#xa0;the coronation of Charlemagne was a sign not of the rebirth of the Roman Empire<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;but of the emergence of a new European civilization.<br />
<br />
By the year of Charlemagne's coronation,<br />
&#xa0;the contours of this new European civilization were beginning to emerge in western Europe.<br />
Increasingly, Europe would become the focus and center of Western civilization.<br />
Building on a fusion of Germanic, GrecoRoman, and Christian elements,<br />
&#xa0;the medieval European world first became visible in the Carolingian Empire of Charlemagne.<br />
The agrarian foundations of the eighth and ninth centuries<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;proved inadequate to maintain a large monarchical system,<br />
&#xa0;however, and a new political and military order based on the decentralization of political power<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;subsequently evolved to become an integral part of the political world of the Middle Ages.<br />
<br />
European civilization began on a shaky and uncertain foundation, however.<br />
In the ninth century, Vikings, Magyars, and Muslims posed threats<br />
&#xa0;that could easily have stifled the new society.<br />
But European civilization absorbed the challenges.<br />
The Vikings and Magyars were assimilated, and recovery slowly began.<br />
By 1000, European civilization was ready to embark on a period of dazzling vitality and expansion.<br />
