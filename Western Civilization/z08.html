<p>
A medieval French manuscript illustration of the coronation
of Charlemagne by Pope Leo III
</p>

<p>
IN 800, CHARLEMAGNE, the king of the Franks, journeyed to
Rome to help Pope Leo III, who was barely clinging to power in the
face of rebellious Romans. On Christmas Day, Charlemagne and his
family, attended by Romans, Franks, and even visitors from the Byzantine Empire, crowded into Saint Peter’s Basilica to hear Mass.
Quite unexpectedly, at least according to a Frankish writer, ‘‘as the
king rose from praying before the tomb of the blessed apostle Peter,
Pope Leo placed a golden crown on his head.’’ In keeping with ancient tradition, the people in the church shouted, ‘‘Long life and victory to Charles Augustus, crowned by God the great and pacific
Emperor of the Romans.’’ Seemingly, the Roman Empire in the West
had been reborn, and Charles had become the first western emperor
since 476. But this ‘‘Roman emperor’’ was actually a German king,
and he had been crowned by the head of the western Christian
church. In truth, the coronation of Charlemagne was a sign not of
the rebirth of the Roman Empire but of the emergence of a new
European civilization.
</p>

<p>
By the year of Charlemagne’s coronation, the contours of this
new European civilization were beginning to emerge in western
Europe. Increasingly, Europe would become the focus and center
of Western civilization. Building on a fusion of Germanic, GrecoRoman, and Christian elements, the medieval European world first
became visible in the Carolingian Empire of Charlemagne. The
agrarian foundations of the eighth and ninth centuries proved inadequate to maintain a large monarchical system, however, and a new
political and military order based on the decentralization of political
power subsequently evolved to become an integral part of the political world of the Middle Ages.
</p>

<p>
European civilization began on a shaky and uncertain foundation, however. In the ninth century, Vikings, Magyars, and Muslims
posed threats that could easily have stifled the new society. But
European civilization absorbed the challenges. The Vikings and
Magyars were assimilated, and recovery slowly began. By 1000,
European civilization was ready to embark on a period of dazzling
vitality and expansion.
</p>

<p>
The World of the Carolingians
</p>

<p>
Q Focus Questions: What was the significance of
Charlemagne’s coronation as emperor? In what ways
did the political, intellectual, and daily life in the
Carolingian Empire represent a fusion of GalloRoman, Germanic, and Christian practices?
</p>

<p>
By the eighth century, the Merovingian dynasty was losing its control of the Frankish lands. Charles Martel, the
Carolingian mayor of the palace of Austrasia, became the
virtual ruler of these territories. When Charles died in
741, Pepin, his son, deposed the Merovingians and assumed the kingship of the Frankish state, an action approved by the pope. In imitation of an Old Testament
practice, Pepin (751&#x2013;768) was crowned and formally
anointed with holy oil by a representative of the pope.
The anointing not only symbolized that the king had
been entrusted with a sacred office but also provided yet
another example of the fusion between Germanic institutions and Christian practices in the Early Middle
Ages.
</p>

<p>
Charlemagne and the Carolingian
Empire (768&#x2013;814)
</p>

<p>
Pepin was succeeded on the throne of the Frankish
kingdom by his son, a dynamic and powerful ruler
known to history as Charles the Great, or Charlemagne
(Carolus magnus in Latin&#x2014;hence our word Carolingian).
Charlemagne was a determined and decisive man, intelligent and inquisitive. A fierce warrior, he was also a wise
patron of learning and a resolute statesman (see the box
on p. 156). He greatly expanded the territory of the
Carolingian Empire during his lengthy rule.
</p>

<p>
Expansion of the Carolingian Empire
</p>

<p>
In the tradition
of the Germanic kings, Charlemagne was a determined
warrior who undertook fifty-four military campaigns.
Even though the Frankish army was relatively small&#x2014;only
eight thousand men gathered each spring for campaigning&#x2014;
supplying it and transporting it to distant areas could still
present serious problems. The Frankish army consisted
mostly of infantry, with some cavalry armed with swords
and spears.
</p>

<p>
Charlemagne’s campaigns took him to many parts of
Europe. In 773, Charlemagne led his army into Italy,
crushed the Lombards, and took control of the Lombard
state. Although his son was crowned king of Italy,
Charlemagne was its real ruler. Four years after his invasion of Italy, Charlemagne moved his forces into
northern Spain. This campaign proved disappointing: not
only did the Basques harass his army as it crossed the
Pyrenees on the way home, but they also ambushed and
annihilated his rear guard.
</p>

<p>
Charlemagne was considerably more successful with
his eastern campaigns into Germany, especially against
the Saxons living between the Elbe River and the North
Sea. As Einhard, Charlemagne’s biographer, recounted it:
</p>

<p>
No war ever undertaken by the Frank nation was carried on
with such persistence and bitterness, or cost so much labor,
because the Saxons, like almost all the tribes of Germany,
were a fierce people, given to the worship of devils, and hostile to our religion, and did not consider it dishonorable to
transgress and violate all law, human and divine.1
</p>

<p>
Charlemagne’s insistence that the Saxons convert to
Christianity simply fueled their resistance. Not until 804,
after eighteen campaigns, was Saxony finally pacified and
added to the Carolingian domain.
</p>

<p>
In southeastern Germany, Charlemagne invaded the
land of the Bavarians in 787 and brought them into his
empire by the following year, an expansion that then
brought him into contact with the southern Slavs and the
Avars. The latter disappeared from history after their
utter devastation at the hands of Charlemagne’s army.
Now at its height, Charlemagne’s empire covered much of
western and central Europe (see Map 8.1); not until the
time of Napoleon in the nineteenth century would an
empire of this size be seen again in Europe.
</p>

<p>
Governing the Empire
</p>

<p>
Charlemagne continued the
efforts of his father in organizing the Carolingian
kingdom. Because there was no system of public taxation, Charlemagne was dependent on the royal estates
for the resources he needed to govern his empire. Food
and goods derived from these lands provided support
for the king, his household staff, and officials. To keep
the nobles in his service, Charlemagne granted part of
the royal lands as lifetime holdings to nobles who assisted him.
</p>

<p>
Besides the household staff, the administration of the
empire was accomplished by counts, who were the king’s
chief representatives in local areas. Counts were members
of the nobility who had already existed under the Merovingians. They had come to control public services in
their own lands and thus acted as judges, military leaders,
and agents of the king. Gradually, as the rule of the
Merovingian kings weakened, many counts had simply
attached the royal lands and services performed on behalf
of the king to their own family possessions.
</p>

<p>
In an effort to gain greater control over his kingdom,
Charlemagne attempted to limit the power of the counts.
They were required to serve outside their own family
lands and were moved about periodically rather than
being permitted to remain in a county for life. By making
the offices appointive, Charlemagne tried to prevent the
counts’ children from automatically inheriting their offices. Moreover, as another check on the counts, Charlemagne instituted the missi dominici (‘‘messengers of the
lord king’’), a lay lord and a church official who were sent
out to local districts to ensure that the counts were executing the king’s wishes.
</p>

<p>
The Carolingian system was glaringly inefficient.
Great distances had to be covered on horseback, making
it impossible for Charlemagne and his household staff to
exercise much supervision over local affairs. What held
the system together was personal loyalty to the king, who
was strong enough to ensure loyalty by force when
necessary.
</p>

<p>
Charlemagne also realized that the Catholic church
could provide valuable assistance in governing his kingdom. By the end of the seventh century, the system of
ecclesiastical government within the Christian church
that had been created in the Late Roman Empire had
largely disintegrated. Many church offices were not filled
or were held by grossly unqualified relatives of the royal
family. Both Pepin and his son Charlemagne took up the
cause of church reform by creating new bishoprics and
archbishoprics, restoring old ones, and seeing to it that
the clergy accepted the orders of their superiors and executed their duties.
</p>

<p>
Charlemagne as Emperor
</p>

<p>
As Charlemagne’s power grew, so did his prestige
as the most powerful Christian ruler; one
monk even wrote of his empire as the
‘‘kingdom of Europe.’’ In 800, Charlemagne acquired a new title&#x2014;emperor of
the Romans&#x2014;largely as a result of the
ever-closer relationship between the papacy and the Frankish monarchs.
</p>

<p>
Already during the reign of Pepin,
an alliance emerged between the kingdom of the Franks and the papacy. The
popes welcomed this support, and in the
course of the second half of the eighth
century, they increasingly severed their
ties with the Byzantine Empire and drew
closer to the Frankish kingdom. Charlemagne encouraged this development.
In 799, after a rebellion against his authority, Pope Leo III (795&#x2013;816) managed to escape from Rome and flee
to safety at Charlemagne’s court. Charlemagne offered assistance, and when
he went to Rome in November 800 to
settle affairs, he was received by the pope
like an emperor. On Christmas Day in
800, Pope Leo placed a crown on
Charlemagne’s head and declared him
emperor of the Romans.
</p>

<p>
The Significance of Charlemagne
</p>

<p>
The
significance of this imperial coronation
has been much debated by historians. We
are not even sure whether the idea was
discussed when Charlemagne and the pope met in the
summer of 799 in Paderborn in German lands or whether
Charlemagne was pleased or displeased. Charlemagne’s biographer Einhard claimed that Charlemagne ‘‘at first had
such an aversion that he declared that he would not have set
foot in the Church the day that it was conferred, although it
was a great feast-day, if he could have foreseen the design of
the Pope.’’2 But Charlemagne also perceived the usefulness
of the imperial title; after all, he was now on a level of
equality with the Byzantine emperor. Moreover, the papacy
now had a defender of great stature, although later popes in
the Middle Ages would become involved in fierce struggles
with emperors over who possessed the higher power.
</p>

<p>
In any case, Charlemagne’s coronation as Roman
emperor demonstrated the strength, even after three
hundred years, of the concept of an enduring Roman
Empire. More important, it symbolized the fusion of
Roman, Christian, and Germanic elements. Did this fusion constitute the foundation of European civilization?
</p>

<p>
A Germanic king had been crowned emperor of the Romans by the spiritual leader of western Christendom.
Charlemagne ruled an empire that stretched from the
North Sea in the north to Italy in the south and from
France in western Europe to Vienna in central Europe.
This domain differed significantly from the Roman Empire, which encompassed much of the Mediterranean
world. Had not a new civilization emerged? And should
Charlemagne not be regarded, as one of his recent biographers has argued, as the ‘‘father of Europe’’?
</p>

<p>
The Carolingian Intellectual Renewal
</p>

<p>
Charlemagne had a strong desire to revive learning in his
kingdom, an attitude that stemmed from his own intellectual curiosity as well as the need to provide educated
clergy for the church and literate officials for the government. His efforts led to a revival of learning and
culture that some historians have labeled the Carolingian
Renaissance, or ‘‘rebirth’’ of learning.
</p>

<p>
For the most part, the revival of Classical studies
and the efforts to preserve Latin culture took place in the
monasteries, many of which had been established by the Irish and English missionaries
of the seventh and eighth centuries. By the
ninth century, the work required of Benedictine
monks was the copying of manuscripts.
Monasteries established scriptoria, or writing
rooms, where monks copied not only the
works of early Christianity, such as the Bible,
but also the works of Classical Latin authors.
The production of manuscripts in Carolingian monastic scriptoria was a crucial factor in
the preservation of the ancient legacy. About
eight thousand manuscripts survive from
Carolingian times. Virtually 90 percent of the
ancient Roman works that we have today exist
because they were copied by Carolingian monks.
</p>

<p>
Charlemagne personally promoted learning by establishing a palace school and encouraging scholars from all over Europe to
come to the Carolingian court. The best
known of these scholars was Alcuin, from the
famous school at York, founded as part of a
great revival of learning in the Anglo-Saxon
kingdom of Northumbria. From 782 to 796,
while serving at Charlemagne’s court as an
adviser on ecclesiastical affairs, Alcuin also
provided the leadership for the palace school.
He concentrated on teaching Classical Latin
and adopted Cassiodorus’ sevenfold division
of knowledge known as the liberal arts (see
Chapter 7), which became the basis for all
later medieval education. All in all, the Carolingian Renaissance played a crucial role in keeping the Classical
heritage alive as well as maintaining the intellectual life of
the Catholic church.
</p>

<p>
Life in the Carolingian World
</p>

<p>
In daily life as well as intellectual life, the Europe of the
Carolingian era witnessed an amalgamation of Roman,
Germanic, and Christian practices. These last in particular seem to have exercised an ever-increasing influence.
</p>

<p>
Family and Marriage
</p>

<p>
By Carolingian times, the Catholic church had begun to influence Frankish family life
and marital and sexual attitudes. Marriages in Frankish
society were arranged by fathers or uncles to meet the
needs of the extended family. Although wives were expected to be faithful to their husbands, Frankish aristocrats often kept concubines, either slave girls or free
women from their estates. Even the ‘‘most Christian king’’
Charlemagne kept a number of concubines.
</p>

<p>
To limit such sexual license, the church increasingly
emphasized its role in marriage and attempted to
Christianize it. Although marriage was a civil arrangement, priests tried to add their blessings and strengthen
the concept of a special marriage ceremony. To stabilize
marriages, the church also began to emphasize monogamy and permanence. A Frankish church council in 789
stipulated that marriage was ‘‘indissoluble’’ and condemned the practice of concubinage and easy divorce, and
during the reign of Emperor Louis the Pious (814&#x2013;840),
the church formally prohibited divorce. Now a man who
married was expected to remain with his wife ‘‘even
though she were sterile, deformed, old, dirty, drunken, a
frequenter of bad company, lascivious, vain, greedy, unfaithful, quarrelsome, abusive . . . , for when that man was
free, he freely engaged himself.’’4
</p>

<p>
The acceptance and spread of the Catholic church’s
views on the indissolubility of marriage encouraged the
development of the nuclear family at the expense of the
extended family. Although kinship was still an influential
social and political force, the conjugal unit came to be
seen as the basic unit of society. The new practice of
young couples establishing their own households brought
a dynamic element to European society. It also had a
significant impact on women (see the box above). In the
extended family, the eldest woman controlled all the other
female members; in the nuclear family, the wife was still
dominated by her husband, but at least she now had
control of her own household and children.
</p>

<p>
Christianity and Sexuality
</p>

<p>
The early church fathers
had stressed that celibacy and complete abstinence from
sexual activity constituted an ideal state superior to
marriage. Subsequently, the early church gradually developed a case for clerical celibacy, although it proved
impossible to enforce in the Early Middle Ages. The early
fathers had also emphasized, however, that not all people
had the self-discipline to remain celibate. It was thus
permissible to marry, as Paul had indicated in his first
epistle to the Corinthians:
</p>

<p>
It is good for a man not to touch a woman. Nevertheless, to
avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let
every woman have her own husband. . . . I say therefore to
the unmarried and widows, it is good for them if they abide
even as I. But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it
is better to marry than to burn.
</p>

<p>
The church thus viewed marriage as the lesser of two evils;
it was a concession to human weakness and fulfilled the
need for companionship, sex, and children. In the church
of the Early Middle Ages, it was generally agreed that
marriage gave the right to indulge in sexual intercourse.
Sex, then, was permissible within marriage, but only so
long as it was used for the sole purpose of procreation and
not for pleasure. The church condemned all forms of
contraception and also strongly condemned abortion, although this prohibition failed to stop either practice.
Various herbal potions were available to prevent conception or cause abortion. The Catholic church accepted only
one way to limit children: periodic or total abstinence
from intercourse.
</p>

<p>
The Catholic church’s condemnation of sexual activity outside marriage also included homosexuality.
Neither Roman religion nor Roman law had recognized
any real difference between homosexual and heterosexual
eroticism, and the Roman Empire had taken no legal
measures against homosexual relations between adults.
Later, in the Byzantine Empire, the emperor Justinian in
538 condemned homosexuality, emphasizing that such
practices brought down the wrath of God (‘‘we have
provoked Him to anger’’) and endangered the welfare of
the state. Justinian recommended that the guilty parties
be punished by castration. Although the church in the
Early Middle Ages similarly condemned homosexuality, it
also pursued a flexible policy in its treatment of homosexuals. In the Early Middle Ages, homosexuals were
treated less harshly than married couples who practiced
contraception.
</p>

<p>
Diet
</p>

<p>
For both rich and poor, the fundamental staple of
the Carolingian diet was bread. The aristocratic classes, as
well as the monks, consumed it in large quantities. Ovens
at the monastery of Saint Gall were able to bake a thousand
loaves of bread. Sometimes a gruel made of barley and oats
was substituted for bread in the peasant diet.
</p>

<p>
The upper classes in Carolingian society enjoyed a
much more varied diet than the peasants. Pork was the
primary meat. Domestic pigs, allowed to run wild in the
forests to find their own food, were collected and
slaughtered in the fall, then smoked and salted to be eaten
during the winter months. Because Carolingian aristocrats were especially fond of roasted meat, hunting wild
game became one of their favorite activities. They ate
little beef and mutton, however, because cattle were kept
as dairy cows and oxen to draw plows, and sheep were
raised for wool.
</p>

<p>
Dairy products became prevalent in the Carolingian
diet. Milk, which spoiled rapidly, was made into cheese
and butter. Chickens were raised for their eggs. Vegetables
also formed a crucial part of the diet of both the rich
and the poor. These included legumes, such as beans,
peas, and lentils, and roots, such as garlic, onions, and
carrots.
</p>

<p>
Both gluttony and drunkenness were vices shared by
many people in Carolingian society. Monastic rations
were greatly enlarged in the eighth century to include a
daily allotment of 3.7 pounds of bread (nuns were permitted
only 3 pounds), 1.5 quarts of wine or ale, 2 to 3 ounces of
cheese, and 8 ounces of vegetables (4 for nuns). These
rations totaled 6,000 calories a day, and since only heavy
and fatty foods&#x2014;bread, milk, and cheese&#x2014;were considered nourishing, we begin to understand why some
Carolingians were known for their potbellies.
</p>

<p>
Everyone in Carolingian society, including abbots
and monks, drank heavily and often to excess. Taverns
became a regular feature of life and were found everywhere: in marketplaces, in pilgrimage centers, and on
royal, episcopal, and monastic estates. Drinking contests
were not unusual; one penitential stated, ‘‘Does drunken
bravado encourage you to attempt to outdrink your
friends? If so, thirty days’ fast.’’
</p>

<p>
The aristocrats and monks favored wine above all
other beverages, and much care was lavished on its production, especially by monasteries. Ale was especially
popular in the northern and eastern parts of the Carolingian world. Water was also drunk as a beverage, but
much care had to be taken to obtain pure sources from
wells or clear streams.
</p>

<p>
Health
</p>

<p>
Medical practice in Carolingian times stressed
the use of medicinal herbs and bleeding. Although the
latter was practiced regularly, moderation was frequently
recommended. Some advised carefulness as well: ‘‘Who
dares to undertake a bleeding should see to it that his
hand does not tremble.’’ Physicians were also available
when people faced serious illnesses. Many were clerics,
and monasteries trained their own. Monasteries kept
medical manuscripts copied from ancient works and grew
herbs to provide stocks of medicinal plants. Carolingian
medical manuscripts contained descriptions of illnesses,
recipes for medical potions, and even gynecological advice, although monks in particular expended little effort
on female medical needs.
</p>

<p>
Physicians of the Early Middle Ages supplemented
their medicines and natural practices with appeals for
otherworldly help. Magical rites and influences were
carried over from pagan times; Germanic tribes had used
magical medicine for centuries. But as pagans were converted to Christianity, miraculous healing through the
intervention of God, Jesus, or the saints soon replaced
pagan practices. Medieval chronicles abound with accounts of people healed by touching a saint’s body.
</p>

<p>
Disintegration of the
Carolingian Empire
</p>

<p>
Q Focus Question: What impact did the Vikings have on
the history and culture of medieval Europe?
</p>

<p>
The Carolingian Empire began to disintegrate soon after
Charlemagne’s death. Charlemagne was succeeded by his
son Louis the Pious (814&#x2013;840), who was unable to control
either the Frankish aristocracy or his own four sons, who
fought continually. In 843, after their father’s death, the
three surviving brothers signed the Treaty of Verdun. This
agreement divided the Carolingian Empire among them
into three major sections: Charles the Bald (843&#x2013;877)
obtained the west
Frankish lands, which
formed the core of the
eventual kingdom of
France; Louis the German (843&#x2013;876) took
the eastern lands, which
became Germany; and
Lothair (840&#x2013;855) received the title of emperor and a ‘‘Middle
Kingdom’’ extending
from the North Sea to
Italy, including the
Netherlands, the Rhineland, and northern Italy.
The territories of the
Middle Kingdom became a source of incessant struggle between the other
two Frankish rulers and their heirs. Indeed, France and
Germany would fight over the territories of the Middle
Kingdom for centuries.
</p>

<p>
Although this division of the Carolingian Empire was
made for political reasons (dividing landholdings among
the male heirs was a traditional Frankish custom), two
different cultures began to emerge. By the ninth century,
inhabitants of the west Frankish area were speaking a
Romance language derived from Latin that became
French. Eastern Franks spoke a Germanic dialect. The
later kingdoms of France and Germany did not yet exist,
however. In the ninth century, the frequent struggles
among the numerous heirs of the sons of Louis the Pious
led to further disintegration of the Carolingian Empire. In
the meantime, while powerful aristocrats acquired even
more power in their own local territories at the expense of
the squabbling Carolingian rulers, the process of disintegration was abetted by external attacks on various parts
of the old Carolingian world.
</p>

<p>
Invasions of the Ninth and Tenth Centuries
</p>

<p>
In the ninth and tenth centuries, western Europe was
beset by a wave of invasions of several non-Christian
peoples&#x2014;one old enemy, the Muslims, and two new ones,
the Magyars and Vikings (see Map 8.2). The Muslims
began a new series of attacks in the Mediterranean in the
ninth century. They raided the southern coasts of Europe,
especially Italy; occupied Sicily; destroyed the Carolingian
defenses in northern Spain; and conducted forays into
southern France. The Magyars were a people from western Asia who moved into eastern and central Europe at
the end of the ninth century. They established themselves
on the plains of Hungary and from there made raids into
western Europe. The Magyars were finally crushed at the
Battle of Lechfeld in Germany in 955. At the end of the
tenth century, they were converted to Christianity and
settled down to establish the kingdom of Hungary.
</p>

<p>
The Vikings
</p>

<p>
By far the most devastating and farreaching attacks of the time came from the Northmen or
Norsemen of Scandinavia, also known as the Vikings.
The Vikings were a Germanic people who had settled
in Scandinavia. Why they invaded other areas of Europe
is uncertain. Perhaps overpopulation and the emergence
of more effective monarchs in Denmark, Norway, and
Sweden caused some of the freedom-loving Scandinavians
to seek escape from the growing order. The Vikings’ great
love of adventure and their search for booty and new
avenues of trade may also have been important factors.
</p>

<p>
Two features of Viking society help explain what the
Vikings accomplished. First, they were warriors. And
second, they were superb shipbuilders and sailors. Their
ships were the best of the period. Long and narrow with
beautifully carved arched prows, the Viking ‘‘dragon
ships’’ carried about fifty men. Their shallow draft enabled them to sail up European rivers and attack places at
some distance inland. Vikings sacked villages and towns,destroyed churches, and easily defeated small local armies.
Viking attacks frightened people and led many a clergyman to plead with them to change their behavior and
appease God’s anger, as is revealed in this sermon in 1014
by an English archbishop:
</p>

<p>
Things have not gone well now for a long time at home or
abroad, but there has been devastation and persecution in
every district again and again, and the English have been for
a long time now completely defeated and too greatly disheartened through God’s anger; and the pirates [Vikings] so
strong with God’s consent that often in battle one puts to
flight ten, and sometimes less, sometimes more, all because
of our sins. . . . We pay them continually and they humiliate
us daily; they ravage and they burn, plunder, and rob and
carry on board; and lo, what else is there in all these events
except God’s anger clear and visible over this people?6
</p>

<p>
Because there were different groups of Scandinavians,
Viking expansion varied a great deal. Norwegian Vikings
moved into Ireland and western England, while the Danes
attacked eastern England, Frisia, and the Rhineland and
navigated rivers to enter western Frankish lands. Swedish
Vikings dominated the Baltic Sea and progressed into the
Slavic areas to the east. Moving into northwestern Russia,
they went down the rivers to Novgorod and Kiev and
established fortified ports throughout these territories.
</p>

<p>
Early Viking raids had been carried out largely in the
summer; by the mid-ninth century, however, the Northmen had begun to establish winter settlements in Europe
from which they could make expeditions to conquer and
settle new lands. By 850, groups of Norsemen had settled
in Ireland, and the Danes occupied an area known as the
Danelaw in northeast England by 878. Beginning in 911, the
ruler of the western Frankish lands gave one band of Vikings land at the mouth of the Seine River, forming a section
of France that ultimately became known as Normandy. This
policy of settling the Vikings and converting them to
Christianity was a deliberate one, since the new inhabitants
served as protectors against additional Norseman attacks.
</p>

<p>
The Vikings were also daring explorers. After 860,
they sailed westward in their long ships across the north
Atlantic, reaching Iceland in 874. Erik the Red, a Viking
exiled from Iceland, traveled even farther west and discovered Greenland in 985. AViking site in North America
was founded in Newfoundland.
</p>

<p>
By the tenth century, Viking expansion was drawing to
a close, but not before Viking settlements had been made
in many parts of Europe. Like the Magyars, the Vikings
were assimilated into European civilization. Once again,
Christianity proved a decisive civilizing force. Europe and
Christianity were becoming virtually synonymous.
</p>

<p>
The Viking raids and settlements also had important
political repercussions. The inability of royal authorities
to protect their peoples against these incursions caused
local populations to turn instead to the local aristocrats
who provided security for them. In the process, the
landed aristocrats not only increased their strength and
prestige but also assumed even more of the functions of
local governments that had previously belonged to kings;
over time these developments led to a new political and
military order.
</p>

<p>
The Emerging World of Lords
and Vassals
</p>

<p>
Q Focus Question: What was fief-holding, and how was
it related to manorialism?
</p>

<p>
The renewed invasions and the disintegration of the
Carolingian Empire led to the emergence of a new type of
relationship between free individuals. When governments
ceased to be able to defend their subjects, it became important to find some powerful lord who could offer
protection in exchange for service. The contract sworn
between a lord and his subordinate (known as a vassal) is
the basis of a form of social organization that later generations of historians called feudalism. But feudalism was
never a system, and many historians today prefer to avoid
using the term.
</p>

<p>
Vassalage
</p>

<p>
The practice of vassalage was derived from Germanic society, in which warriors swore an oath of loyalty to their
leader. They fought for their chief, and he in turn took care
of their needs. By the eighth century, an individual who
served a lord in a military capacity was known as a vassal.
</p>

<p>
With the breakdown of governments, powerful nobles took control of large areas of land. They needed men
to fight for them, so the practice arose of giving grants of
land to vassals who in return would fight for their lord.
The Frankish army had originally consisted of foot soldiers, dressed in coats of mail and armed with swords.
But in the eighth century, when larger horses and the
stirrup were introduced, a military change began to occur.
Earlier, horsemen had been throwers of spears. Now they
wore armored coats of mail (the larger horse could carry
the weight) and wielded long lances that enabled them to
act as battering rams (the stirrups kept them on their
horses). For almost five hundred years, warfare in Europe
was dominated by heavily armored cavalry, or knights, as
they came to be called. The knights came to have the
greatest social prestige and formed the backbone of the
European aristocracy.
</p>

<p>
Of course, a horse, armor, and weapons were expensive to purchase and maintain, and learning to wield
these instruments skillfully on horseback took much time
and practice. Consequently, lords who wanted men to
fight for them had to grant each vassal a piece of land that
provided for the support of the vassal and his family. In
return, the vassal provided fighting skills. In the Early
Middle Ages, when trade was minimal and wealth was
based primarily on landholdings, land became the most
important gift a lord could give to a vassal in return for
military service.
</p>

<p>
The relationship between lord and vassal was made
official by a public ceremony. To become a vassal, a man
performed an act of homage to his lord, as described in
this passage from a medieval digest of law:
</p>

<p>
The man should put his hands together as a sign of humility,
and place them between the two hands of his lord as a token
that he vows everything to him and promises faith to him;
and the lord should receive him and promise to keep faith
with him. Then the man should say: ‘‘Sir, I enter your homage and faith and become your man by mouth and hands
[that is, by taking the oath and placing his hands between
those of the lord], and I swear and promise to keep faith
and loyalty to you against all others, and to guard your
rights with all my strength.’’7
</p>

<p>
As in the earlier Germanic band, loyalty to one’s lord was
the chief virtue.
</p>

<p>
Fief-Holding
</p>

<p>
The land or some other type of income granted to a vassal
in return for military service came to be known as a fief.
In time, many vassals who held such grants of land came
to exercise rights of jurisdiction or political and legal
authority within their fiefs. As the Carolingian world
disintegrated politically under the impact of internal
dissension and invasions, an increasing number of powerful
lords arose. Instead of a single government, many people
were now responsible for keeping order.
</p>

<p>
Fief-holding also became increasingly complicated with the development of subinfeudation. The vassals of
a king, who were themselves great lords,
might also have vassals who would owe
them military service in return for a
grant of land from their estates. Those
vassals, in turn, might likewise have
vassals, who at this low level would
be simple knights with barely enough
land to provide their equipment. The
lord-vassal relationship, then, bound
together both greater and lesser landowners. At all levels, the lord-vassal relationship was always an honorable
relationship between free men and did
not imply any sense of servitude. Since
kings could no longer provide security
in the midst of the breakdown created
by the invasions of the ninth century,
the practice of subinfeudation became
ever more widespread. With their rights
of jurisdiction, fiefs gave lords virtual
possession of the rights of government.
</p>

<p>
The new practice of lordship was
basically a product of the Carolingian
world, but it also spread to England, Germany, central
Europe, and in some form to Italy. Fief-holding came to
be characterized by a set of practices that determined the
relationship between a lord and his vassal. The major
obligation of a vassal to his lord was to perform military
service, usually about forty days a year. A vassal was also
required to appear at his lord’s court when summoned to
give advice to the lord. He might also be asked to sit in
judgment in a legal case because the important vassals of
a lord were peers and only they could judge each other.
Finally, vassals were also responsible for aids, or financial
payments to the lord on a number of occasions, including
the knighting of the lord’s eldest son, the marriage of his
eldest daughter, and the ransom of the lord’s person in
the event he was captured.
</p>

<p>
In turn, a lord had responsibilities toward his vassals.
His major obligation was to protect his vassal, either by
defending him militarily or by taking his side in a court of
law if necessary. The lord was also responsible for the
maintenance of the vassal, usually by granting him a fief.
</p>

<p>
The Manorial System
</p>

<p>
The landholding class of nobles and knights comprised a
military elite whose ability to function as warriors depended on having the leisure time to pursue the arts
of war. Landed estates, worked by a dependent peasant
class, provided the economic sustenance that made this
way of life possible. A manor (see Map 8.3) was simply an
agricultural estate operated by a lord and worked by
peasants.
</p>

<p>
Manorialism grew out of the unsettled circumstances
of the Early Middle Ages, when small farmers often
needed protection or food in a time of bad harvests. Free
peasants gave up their freedom to the lords of large landed
estates in return for protection and use of the lord’s land.
Although a large class of free peasants continued to exist,
increasing numbers of free peasants became serfs&#x2014;peasants
bound to the land and required to provide labor services,
pay rents, and be subject to the lord’s jurisdiction. By the
ninth century, probably 60 percent of the population of
western Europe had become serfs.
</p>

<p>
Labor services consisted of working the lord’s demesne,
the land retained by the lord, which might consist of onethird to one-half of the cultivated lands scattered throughout the manor. The rest would be used by the peasants for
themselves. Building barns and digging ditches were also
part of the labor services. Serfs usually worked about three
days a week for their lord.
</p>

<p>
The serfs paid rents by giving the lord a share of every
product they raised. Moreover, serfs paid the lord for the
use of the manor’s common pasturelands, streams, ponds,
and surrounding woodlands. For example, if a serf fished
in the pond or stream on a manor, he turned over part
of the catch to his lord. Peasants were also obliged to pay a
tithe (a tenth of their produce) to their local village church.
</p>

<p>
Lords possessed a variety of legal rights over their
serfs as a result of their unfree status. Serfs were legally
bound to the lord’s lands and could not leave without his
permission. Although free to marry, serfs could not marry
anyone outside their manor without the lord’s approval.
Moreover, lords sometimes exercised public rights or
political authority on their lands, which gave them the
right to try peasants in their own court. In fact, the lord’s
manorial court provided the only law that most peasants
knew. Peasants also had to pay the lord for certain services; for example, they might be required to bring their
grain to the lord’s mill and pay a fee to have it ground
into flour. Thus the rights a lord possessed on his manor
gave him virtual control over both the lives and the
property of his serfs.
</p>

<p>
In the Early Middle Ages, whether free or unfree, a
vast majority of men and women, possibly 90 percent,
worked the land. Although trade declined precipitously
in this period, it never entirely disappeared. Overall,
however, compared to the Byzantine Empire or Muslim
caliphates, western Europe in the Early Middle Ages was
an underdeveloped, predominantly agricultural society.
</p>

<p>
The Zenith of Byzantine
Civilization
</p>

<p>
Q Focus Question: What were the chief developments in
the Byzantine Empire between 750 and 1000?
</p>

<p>
In the seventh and eighth centuries, the Byzantine Empire
had lost much of its territory to Slavs, Bulgars, and
Muslims. By 750, the empire consisted only of Asia Minor,
some lands in the Balkans, and the southern coast of Italy.
Although Byzantium was beset with internal dissension
and invasions in the ninth century, it was able to deal with
them and not only endured but even expanded, reaching
its high point in the tenth century, which some historians
have called the ‘‘golden age of Byzantine civilization.’’
</p>

<p>
During the reign of Michael III (842&#x2013;867), the Byzantine Empire continued to be plagued by problems. The
Bulgars mounted new attacks, and the Arabs continued to
harass the empire. Moreover, a new church problem with
political repercussions erupted over differences between
the pope as leader of the western Christian church
and the patriarch of Constantinople as leader of the
eastern (or Orthodox) Christian church. Patriarch Photius condemned the pope as a heretic for accepting a
revised form of the Nicene Creed stating that the Holy
Spirit proceeded from the Father and the Son instead
of ‘‘the Holy Spirit, who proceeds from the Father.’’ A
council of eastern bishops followed Photius’s wishes and
excommunicated the pope, creating the so-called Photian
schism. Although the differences were later papered over,
this controversy served to further the rift between the
eastern and western Christian churches.
</p>

<p>
The Macedonian Dynasty
</p>

<p>
The problems that arose during Michael’s reign were effectively dealt with by the efforts of a new dynasty of Byzantine
emperors, known as the Macedonians (867&#x2013;1081). This
dynastic line managed to repel the external enemies, go
over to the offensive, and reestablish domestic order.
Supported by the church, the emperors continued to think
of the Byzantine Empire as a continuation of the Christian
Roman Empire of late antiquity. Although for diplomatic
reasons they occasionally recognized the imperial title
of western emperors, such as Charlemagne, they still regarded them as little more than barbarian parvenus.
</p>

<p>
The Macedonian emperors could boast of a remarkable number of achievements in the late ninth and
tenth centuries. They worked to strengthen the position
of free farmers, who felt threatened by the attempts of
landed aristocrats to expand their estates at the expense of
the farmers. The emperors were well aware that the free
farmers made up the rank and file of the Byzantine cavalry and provided the military strength of the empire. The
Macedonian emperors also fostered a burst of economic
prosperity by expanding trade relations with western
Europe, especially by selling silks and metalworks. Thanks
to this prosperity, the city of Constantinople flourished.
Foreign visitors continued to be astounded by its size,
wealth, and physical surroundings. To western Europeans,
it was the stuff of legends and fables (see the box above).
</p>

<p>
In the midst of this prosperity, Byzantine cultural influence expanded due to the active missionary efforts of
eastern Byzantine Christians. Eastern Orthodox Christianity
was spread to eastern European peoples, including the Bulgars and the Serbs. Perhaps the greatest missionary success
occurred when the prince of Kiev in Russia converted to
Christianity in 987.
</p>

<p>
Under the Macedonian rulers, Byzantium enjoyed a
strong civil service, talented emperors, and military advances. In the tenth century, these competent emperors
combined with a number of talented generals to mobilize
the empire’s military resources and take the offensive. The
Bulgars were defeated, and both the eastern and western
parts of Bulgaria were annexed to the empire. The Byzantines went on to add the islands of Crete and Cyprus to
the empire and defeat the Muslim forces in Syria, expanding
the empire to the upper Euphrates. By the end of the reign
of Basil II (976&#x2013;1025), the Byzantine Empire was the largest
it had been since the beginning of the seventh century.
</p>

<p>
The Slavic Peoples of Central
and Eastern Europe
</p>

<p>
Q Focus Question: What patterns of development
occurred in central and eastern Europe as a result of
the Slavic peoples?
</p>

<p>
North of Byzantium and east of the Carolingian Empire
lay a spacious plain through which a number of Asiatic
nomads, including the Huns, Bulgars, Avars, and Magyars, had pushed their way westward, terrorizing and
plundering the settled peasant communities. Eastern
Europe was ravaged by these successive waves of invaders,
who found it relatively easy to create large empires that
were in turn overthrown by the next invaders. Over a
period of time, the invaders themselves were largely assimilated with the native Slavic peoples of the area.
</p>

<p>
The Slavs were originally a single people in central
Europe who, through mass migrations and nomadic invasions, gradually divided into three major groups: the
western, southern, and eastern Slavs (see Map 8.4).
</p>

<p>
Western Slavs
</p>

<p>
In the region east of the eastern Frankish or Germanic
kingdom emerged the Polish and Bohemian kingdoms of
the western Slavs. The Germans assumed responsibility
for the conversion of these Slavic peoples since some
German emperors considered it their duty to spread
Christianity to the barbarians. Of
course, it also gave them the opportunity to extend their political
authority. German missionaries
had converted the Czechs in Bohemia by the end of the ninth
century, and a bishopric eventually occupied by a Czech bishop
was established at Prague in the
tenth. The Slavs in Poland were
not converted until the reign of
Prince Mieszko (c. 960&#x2013;992). In
1000, an independent Polish archbishopric was set up at Gniezno by
the pope. The non-Slavic kingdom
of Hungary, which emerged when
the Magyars settled down after
their defeat at Lechfeld in 955, was
also converted to Christianity by
German missionaries. Saint Stephen, king of Hungary from 997
to 1038, facilitated the acceptance
of Christianity by his people. The
Poles, Czechs, and Hungarians
all accepted Catholic or western
Christianity and became closely
tied to the Roman Catholic
Church and its Latin culture.
</p>

<p>
Southern Slavs
</p>

<p>
The southern and eastern Slavic
populations largely took a different path because of their proximity
to the Byzantine Empire. The Slavic peoples of Moravia
were converted to the Eastern Orthodox Christianity of
the Byzantine Empire by two Byzantine missionary
brothers, Cyril and Methodius, who began their activities
in 863. They created a Slavonic (Cyrillic) alphabet,
translated the Bible into Slavonic, and created Slavonic
church services. While the southern Slavic peoples accepted Christianity, a split eventually developed between
the Croats, who accepted the Roman church, and the
Serbs, who remained loyal to eastern Christianity.
</p>

<p>
Although the Bulgars were originally an Asiatic people
who conquered much of the Balkan peninsula, they were
eventually absorbed by the larger native south Slavic
population. Together, by the ninth century, they formed a
largely Slavic Bulgarian kingdom. Although the conversion
to Christianity of this state was complicated by the rivalry
between the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox
Churches, the Bulgarians eventually accepted the latter. By
the end of the ninth century, they embraced the Slavonic
church services earlier developed by Cyril and Methodius.
The acceptance of Eastern Orthodoxy by the southern
Slavic peoples, the Serbs and Bulgarians, meant that their
cultural life was also linked to the Byzantine state.
</p>

<p>
Eastern Slavs
</p>

<p>
The eastern Slavic peoples, from whom the modern
Russians, White Russians (Belarusians), and Ukrainians
are descended, had settled in the territory of present-day
Ukraine and European Russia. There, beginning in the
late eighth century, they began to contend with Viking
invaders. Swedish Vikings, known to the eastern Slavs as
Varangians, moved down the extensive network of rivers
into the lands of the eastern Slavs in search of booty and
new trade routes. After establishing commercial links
with the Byzantine state, the Varangians built trading
settlements, became involved in the civil wars among the
Slavic peoples, and eventually came to dominate the native peoples, just as their fellow Vikings were doing in
parts of western Europe. According to the traditional
version of the story, the semilegendary Rurik secured his
ruling dynasty in the Slavic settlement of Novgorod in
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Rurik and his fellow Vikings were called the Rus,</li>
</ol>
<p>
from which Russia, the name eventually attached to the
state they founded, is derived (see the box above). Although much about Rurik is unclear, it is certain that his
follower Oleg (c. 873&#x2013;913) took up residence in Kiev and
established the Rus state, a union of
east Slavic territories known as the
principality of Kiev. Oleg’s successors extended their control over the
eastern Slavs and expanded the
territory of Kiev until it encompassed the lands between the Baltic
and Black Seas and the Danube and
Volga Rivers. By marrying Slavic
wives, the Viking ruling class was
gradually assimilated into the Slavic
population, a process confirmed by
their assumption of Slavic names.
</p>

<p>
The growth of the principality
of Kiev attracted religious missionaries, especially from the Byzantine
Empire. One Rus ruler, Vladimir (c. 980&#x2013;1015), married
the Byzantine emperor’s sister and officially accepted
Christianity for himself and his people in 987. His primary
motive was probably not a spiritual one. By all accounts,
Vladimir was a cruel and vicious man who believed an
established church would be helpful in the development of
an organized state. From the end of the tenth century on,
Byzantine Christianity became the model for Russian
religious life, just as Byzantine imperial ideals came to
influence the outward forms of Russian political life.
</p>

<p>
The World of Islam
</p>

<p>
Q Focus Question: What were the chief developments in
the Islamic world between 750 and 1000?
</p>

<p>
The Umayyad dynasty of caliphs had established Damascus as the center of an Islamic empire created by Arab
expansion in the seventh and eighth centuries. But
Umayyad rule created resentment, and the Umayyads also
helped bring about their own end by their corrupt behavior. One caliph, for example, supposedly swam in a
pool of wine and drank enough of it to lower the wine
level considerably. Finally, in 750, Abu al-Abbas, a descendant of the uncle of Muhammad, brought an end to
the Umayyad dynasty and established the Abbasid dynasty, which lasted until 1258.
</p>

<p>
The Abbasid rulers brought much change to the world
of Islam. They tried to break down the distinctions between
Arab and non-Arab Muslims. All Muslims, regardless of
ethnic background, could now hold both civil and military
offices. This helped open Islamic life to the influences of the
civilizations they had conquered. Many Arabs now began to
intermarry with the peoples they had conquered.
</p>

<p>
In 762, the Abbasids built a new capital city, Baghdad, on the Tigris River far to the east of Damascus.
The new capital was well placed. It took advantage of river
traffic to the Persian Gulf and was located on the caravan
route from the Mediterranean to Central Asia. The move
eastward allowed Persian influence to come to the fore,
encouraging a new cultural orientation. Under the Abbasids,
judges, merchants, and government officials, rather than
warriors, were regarded as the ideal citizens.
</p>

<p>
The new Abbasid dynasty experienced a period of
splendid rule well into the ninth century. Best known of
the caliphs of the time was Harun al-Rashid (786&#x2013;809),
whose reign is often described as the golden age of the
Abbasid caliphate. His son al-Ma’mun (813&#x2013;833) was a
great patron of learning. He founded an astronomical
observatory and created a foundation for translating
Classical Greek works. This was also a period of growing
economic prosperity. The Arabs had conquered many of
the richest provinces of the old Roman Empire, and they
now controlled the trade routes to the east. Baghdad
became the center of an enormous trade empire that
extended into Europe, Asia, and Africa, greatly adding to
the wealth of the Islamic world.
</p>

<p>
Despite the prosperity, all was not quite well in the
empire of the Abbasids. There was much fighting over the
succession to the caliphate. When Harun al-Rashid died,
his two sons fought to succeed him in a struggle that
almost destroyed the city of Baghdad. As the tenth-century
Muslim historian al-Mas’udi wrote, ‘‘Mansions were destroyed, most remarkable monuments obliterated; prices
soared. . . . Brother turned his sword against brother, son
against father, as some fought for Amin, others for Ma’-
mun. Houses and palaces fuelled the flames; property was
put to the sack.’’8
</p>

<p>
Vast wealth also gave rise to financial corruption. By
awarding important positions to court favorites, the Abbasid caliphs began to undermine the foundations of their
own power and become figureheads. Rulers of the provinces of the empire broke away from the control of the
caliphs and established their own independent dynasties.
In the eighth century, Spain had already established its
own caliphate when Abd al-Rahman of the
Umayyad dynasty had fled there. In 756, he
seized control of southern Spain and then
expanded his power into the center of the
peninsula. He took the title of emir, or
commander, and set up the emirate of alAndalus (the Arabic name for Spain), with its
center at Co´ rdoba. Under Abd al-Rahman’s
successors, a unique society developed in
which all religions were tolerated. The court
also supported writers and artists, creating a
brilliant and flourishing culture.
</p>

<p>
The fragmentation of the Islamic empire
accelerated in the tenth century. A caliphate
of the Fatimid family was established in
Egypt in 973, and an independent dynasty
also operated in North Africa. Despite the
political disunity of the Islamic world,
however, the underlying Islamic civilization
was unified by two common bonds: the
Qur’an and the Arabic language.
</p>

<p>
Islamic Civilization
</p>

<p>
From the beginning of their empire, Muslim
Arabs had demonstrated a willingness to
absorb the culture of their conquered territories. The
Arabs were truly heirs to the remaining Greco-Roman
culture of the Roman Empire. Just as readily, they assimilated Byzantine and Persian culture. In the eighth and
ninth centuries, numerous Greek, Syrian, and Persian
scientific and philosophical works were translated into
Arabic. As the chief language in the southern Mediterranean and the Near East and the required language of
Muslims, Arabic became a truly international tongue.
</p>

<p>
The Muslims created a brilliant urban culture at a
time when western Europe was predominantly a world of
small rural villages. This can be seen in such new cities as
Baghdad and Cairo, but also in Co´ rdoba, the capital of the
Umayyad caliphate in Spain. With a population of possibly 100,000, Co´ rdoba was Europe’s largest city after
Constantinople. It had seventy public libraries, and the
number of manuscripts in the caliph’s private library
reached 400,000. One caliph collected books from different parts of the world and then had them translated
into Arabic and Latin. These included works on geography that later proved valuable to Western sailors and
merchants. Schools were also established, and the Great
Mosque of Co´ rdoba became a center for scholars from all
over the Islamic world. Large numbers of women served
as teachers and librarians in Co´ rdoba.
</p>

<p>
During the first few centuries of the Arab empire, it
was the Islamic world that saved and spread the scientific
and philosophical works of ancient civilizations. At a time
when the ancient Greek philosophers were largely unknown in Europe, key works by Plato and Aristotle were
translated into Arabic. They were put in a library called
the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, where they were read
and studied by Muslim scholars. Texts on mathematics
were brought from India. This process was aided by the
use of paper. The making of paper was introduced from
China in the eighth century, and by the end of the century, paper factories had been established in Baghdad.
Booksellers and libraries soon followed. European universities later benefited from this scholarship when these
works were translated from Arabic into Latin.
</p>

<p>
Although Islamic scholars are rightly praised for
preserving much of Classical knowledge for the West,
they also made considerable advances of their own. Nowhere is this more evident than in their contributions to
mathematics and the natural sciences. The list of achievements in mathematics and astronomy alone is impressive.
The Muslims adopted and passed on the numerical system
of India, including the use of the zero. In Europe, it
became known as the Arabic system. Al-Khwarizmi,
a ninth-century Iranian mathematician, developed the
mathematical discipline of algebra. In astronomy, the
Muslims were aware that the earth was round, and they
set up an observatory at Baghdad to study the stars,
many of which they named. They also perfected the astrolabe, an instrument used by sailors to determine their
location by observing the positions of heavenly bodies. It
was the astrolabe that made it possible for Europeans to
sail to the Americas.
</p>

<p>
Muslim scholars also made discoveries in chemistry
and developed medicine as a field of scientific study.
Especially renowned was Ibn Sina (980&#x2013;1037), known as
Avicenna in the West, who wrote a medical encyclopedia
that, among other things, stressed the contagious nature
of certain diseases and showed how they could be spread
by contaminated water supplies. After its translation into
Latin, Avicenna’s work became a basic medical textbook
for medieval European university students. Avicenna was
but one of many Arabic scholars whose work was
translated into Latin and helped the development of
intellectual life in Europe in the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries.
</p>

<p>
CONCLUSION
</p>

<p>
After the turmoil of the disintegration of the Roman Empire
and the establishment of the Germanic states, a new European
civilization began to emerge in the Early Middle Ages. The
coronation of Charlemagne, descendant of a Germanic tribe
converted to Christianity, as Roman emperor in 800 symbolized
the fusion of the three chief components of the new European
civilization: the German tribes, the Classical tradition, and
Christianity. In the long run, the creation of a western empire
fostered the idea of a distinct European identity and marked the
shift of power from the south to the north. Italy and the
Mediterranean had been the center of the Roman Empire. The lands
north of the Alps now became the political center of Europe.
</p>

<p>
With the disintegration of the Carolingian Empire, new political
institutions began to develop in Europe, characterized by a decentralization of political control in which lords exercised legal, administrative, and military power. The practice of fief-holding transferred
public authority into private hands and provided the security sorely
lacking in a time of weak central government and repeated invasions by
Muslims, Magyars, and Vikings. While Europe struggled, the Byzantine
and Islamic worlds continued to prosper and flourish, the brilliance
of their urban cultures standing in marked contrast to the underdeveloped rural world of Europe. By 1000, however, the region had
not only recovered but was beginning to expand in ways undreamed
of by previous generations. Europe stood poised for a giant leap.
