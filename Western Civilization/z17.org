THE EARTH-SHATTERING WORK of the ‘‘natural philosophers’’ in the Scientific Revolution had affected only a relatively
small number of Europe’s educated elite. In the eighteenth century,
this changed dramatically as a group of intellectuals known as the
philosophes popularized the ideas of the Scientific Revolution and
used them to undertake a dramatic examination of all aspects of
life. In Paris, the cultural capital of Europe, women took the lead in
bringing together groups of men and women to discuss the new
ideas of the philosophes. At her fashionable home in the Rue SaintHonore´, Marie-The´re`se de Geoffrin, the wife of a wealthy merchant,
held sway over gatherings that became the talk of France and even
Europe. Distinguished foreigners, including a future king of Sweden
and a future king of Poland, competed to receive invitations. When
Madame Geoffrin made a visit to Vienna, she was so well received
that she exclaimed, ‘‘I am better known here than a couple of yards
from my own house!’’ Madame Geoffrin was an amiable but firm
hostess who allowed wide-ranging discussions as long as they
remained in good taste. When she found that artists and philosophers
did not mix particularly well (the artists were high-strung and the
philosophers talked too much), she set up separate meetings: artists
were invited on Mondays, philosophers on Wednesdays. These gatherings were but one of many avenues for the spread of the ideas of the
philosophes. And those ideas had such a widespread impact on their
society that historians ever since have called the eighteenth century
the Age of Enlightenment.

For most of the philosophes, ‘‘enlightenment’’ included the rejection of traditional Christianity. The religious wars and intolerance
of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries had left intellectuals so
disgusted with religious fanaticism that they were open to the new
ideas of the Scientific Revolution. Whereas the great scientists of the
seventeenth century believed that their work exalted God, the intellectuals of the eighteenth century read the same conclusions a different way and increasingly turned their backs on Christian orthodoxy.
Consequently, European intellectual life in the eighteenth century
was marked by the emergence of the secularization that has characterized the modern Western mentality ever since. Ironically, at the
same time that reason and materialism were beginning to replace
faith and worship, a great outburst of religious sensibility manifested
itself in music and art. Clearly, the growing secularization of the
eighteenth century had not yet captured the hearts and minds of
all Europeans.

The Enlightenment

Q Focus Questions: What intellectual developments led
to the emergence of the Enlightenment? Who were the
leading figures of the Enlightenment, and what were
their main contributions? In what type of social
environment did the philosophes thrive, and what role
did women play in that environment?
In 1784, the German philosopher Immanuel Kant defined
the Enlightenment as ‘‘man’s leaving his self-caused immaturity.’’ Whereas earlier periods had been handicapped
by the inability to ‘‘use one’s intelligence without the
guidance of another,’’ Kant proclaimed as the motto of
the Enlightenment: ‘‘Dare to know! Have the courage to
use your own intelligence!’’ The eighteenth-century Enlightenment was a movement of intellectuals who dared
to know. They were greatly impressed with the accomplishments of the Scientific Revolution, and when they
used the word reason---one of their favorite words---they
were advocating the application of the scientific method
to an understanding of every aspect of life. All institutions
and all systems of thought were subject to the rational,
scientific way of thinking if people would only free
themselves from the shackles of past, worthless traditions,
especially religious ones. If Isaac Newton could discover
the natural laws regulating the world of nature, they too,
using reason, could find the laws that governed human
society. This belief in turn led them to hope that they
could make progress toward a better society than the one
they had inherited. Reason, natural law, hope, progress---
these were buzzwords in the heady atmosphere of the
eighteenth century.
The Paths to Enlightenment
Although the intellectuals of the eighteenth century were
much influenced by the scientific ideas of the seventeenth
century, they did not always acquire this knowledge directly from the original sources. After all, Newton’s
Principia was not an easy book to read or comprehend.
Scientific ideas were spread to ever-widening circles of
educated Europeans not so much by scientists themselves
as by popularizers. Especially important as the direct link
between the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth
century and the intellectuals of the eighteenth was
Bernard de Fontenelle (1657--1757). In his Plurality of
Worlds, he used the form of an intimate conversation
between a lady aristocrat and her lover to present a detailed account of the new mechanistic universe. Scores of
the educated elite of Europe learned the new cosmology
in this lighthearted fashion.
A New Skepticism Although the Reformation had attempted to restore religion as the central focus of people’s
lives, it was perhaps inevitable that the dogmatic controversies, religious intolerance, and religious warfare
engendered by it would open the door to the questioning
of religious truths and values. The overthrow of medieval
cosmology and the advent of scientific ideas and rational
explanations in the seventeenth century likewise affected
the belief of educated men and women in the traditional
teachings of Christianity. Skepticism about religion and a
growing secularization of thought were important factors
in the emergence of the Enlightenment.
The Impact of Travel Literature Skepticism about both
Christianity and European culture was nourished by
travel reports. In the course of the seventeenth century,
traders, missionaries, medical practitioners, and explorers
began to publish an increasing number of travel books
that gave accounts of many different cultures. Then, too,
the new geographical adventures of the eighteenth century, especially the discovery in the Pacific of Tahiti, New
Zealand, and Australia by the British explorer James
Cook, aroused much enthusiasm. Educated Europeans
responded to these accounts of far-off lands in different
ways.
For some intellectuals, the existence of exotic peoples,
such as the natives of Tahiti, presented an image of a
‘‘natural man’’ who was far happier than many Europeans.
Denis Diderot, one of the important figures of the
Enlightenment, wrote:
The life of savages is so simple, and our societies are such
complicated machines! The Tahitian is close to the origin
of the world, while the European is closer to its old
age. . . . They understand nothing about our manners or
our laws, and they are bound to see in them nothing but
shackles disguised in a hundred different ways. Those
shackles could only provoke the indignation and scorn of
creatures in whom the most profound feeling is a love
of liberty.1
To Diderot, the noble primitives of Tahiti were honest
and simple people unencumbered by the inequality, religious hypocrisy, sexual repression, and vices of European society. The idea of the ‘‘noble savage’’ would play an
important role in the political work of some philosophes.
The travel literature of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries also led to the realization that there were
highly developed civilizations with different customs in
other parts of the world. One German university professor
praised the Confucian morality of China as superior to the
intolerant attitudes of Christianity. Some European intellectuals began to evaluate their own civilization relative
to others. What had once seemed universal truths and
practices grounded in reason now appeared to be mere matters of custom.
The Legacy of Locke and Newton A
final source of inspiration for the Enlightenment came primarily from Isaac
Newton and John Locke. Newton was
frequently singled out for praise as the
‘‘greatest and rarest genius that ever rose for
the ornament and instruction of the species.’’2 The English poet Alexander Pope
declared, ‘‘Nature and Nature’s Laws lay
hid in Night; God said, ‘Let Newton be,’
and all was Light.’’ Enchanted by the grand
design of the Newtonian world-machine,
the intellectuals of the Enlightenment were
convinced that by following Newton’s rules
of reasoning, they could discover the natural laws that governed politics, economics, justice, religion, and the arts.
John Locke’s theory of knowledge
had a great impact on eighteenth-century
intellectuals. In his Essay Concerning Human Understanding, written in 1690,
Locke denied Descartes’ belief in innate
ideas. Instead, argued Locke, every person
was born with a tabula rasa, a blank mind:
Let us then suppose the mind to be, as we say, white paper,
void of all characters, without any ideas. How comes it to be
furnished? Whence comes it by that vast store which the
busy and boundless fancy of man has painted on it with an
almost endless variety? Whence has it all the materials of
reason and knowledge? To this I answer, in one word, from
experience. . . . Our observation, employed either about
external sensible objects or about the internal operations of
our minds perceived and reflected on by ourselves, is that
which supplies our understanding with all the materials of
thinking.3
Our knowledge, then, is derived from our environment,
not from heredity; from reason, not from faith. Locke’s
philosophy implied that people were molded by their environment, by the experiences that they received through
their senses from their surrounding world. By changing the
environment and subjecting people to proper influences,
they could be changed and a new society created. And how
should the environment be changed? Newton had already
paved the way by showing how reason enabled enlightened people to discover the natural laws to which all institutions should conform. No wonder the philosophes
were enamored of Newton and Locke. Taken together,
their ideas seemed to offer the hope of a ‘‘brave new
world’’ built on reason.
The Philosophes and Their Ideas
The intellectuals of the Enlightenment were known by the
French term philosophes, although not all of them were
French and few were actually philosophers. They were literary people, professors, journalists, statesmen, economists,
political scientists, and above all, social reformers. They
came from both the nobility and the middle class, and a
few even stemmed from lower-middle-class origins.
Although it was a truly international and cosmopolitan
movement, the Enlightenment also enhanced the dominant role already being played by French culture; Paris
was its recognized capital. Most of the leaders of the
Enlightenment were French. The French philosophes
in turn affected intellectuals elsewhere and started a
movement that enveloped the entire Western world, including the British and Spanish colonies in America (see
Map 17.1).
Although the philosophes faced different political
circumstances depending on the country in which they
lived, they shared common bonds as part of a truly international movement. Although they were called philosophers, what did philosophy mean to them? The role
of philosophy was to change the world, not just to discuss
it. To the philosophes, rationalism did not mean the
creation of a grandiose system of thought to explain all
things. Reason was scientific method, an appeal to facts
and experience. A spirit of rational criticism was to be
applied to everything, including religion and politics.
Although the philosophes constituted a kind of
‘‘family circle’’ bound together by common intellectual
bonds, they often disagreed. Spanning almost a century,
the Enlightenment evolved over time, with each succeeding generation becoming more radical as it built on
the contributions of the previous one. A few people,
however, dominated the landscape completely, and we
might best begin our survey of the ideas of the philosophes
by looking at the three French giants---Montesquieu,
Voltaire, and Diderot.
Montesquieu and Political Thought Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu (1689--1755), came from
the French nobility. He received an education in the
classics and then studied law. In his first work published
in 1721, the Persian Letters, he used the format of two
Persians supposedly traveling in western Europe and
sending their impressions back home to enable him to
criticize French institutions, especially the Catholic
church and the French monarchy. Much of the program
of the French Enlightenment is contained in this work:
the attack on traditional religion, the advocacy of religious toleration, the denunciation of slavery, and the use
of reason to liberate human beings from their prejudices.
His most famous work, The Spirit of the Laws, was
published in 1748. This treatise was a comparative study
of governments in which Montesquieu attempted to apply the scientific method to the social and political arena
to ascertain the ‘‘natural laws’’ governing the social relationships of human beings. Montesquieu distinguished
three basic kinds of governments: the republic, suitable
for small states and based on citizen involvement; monarchy, appropriate for midsized states and grounded in
the ruling class’s adherence to law; and despotism, apt for
large empires and dependent on fear to inspire obedience.
Montesquieu used England as an example of the second
category, and it was his praise and analysis of England’s
constitution that led to his most far-reaching and longestlasting contribution to political thought---the importance
of checks and balances achieved through a separation of
powers. He believed that England’s system, with its separate executive, legislative, and judicial powers that served
to limit and control each other, provided the greatest
freedom and security for a state. The translation of his
work into English two years after publication ensured its
being read by American philosophes who incorporated
its principles into the American constitution (see
Chapter 19).
Voltaire and the Enlightenment The greatest figure of
the Enlightenment was Franc¸ois-Marie Arouet, known
simply as Voltaire (1694--1778). Born to a prosperous
middle-class family from Paris, Voltaire received a Classical education typical of Jesuit schools. Although he
studied law, he wished to be a writer and achieved his first
success as a playwright. Voltaire was a prolific author and
wrote an almost endless stream of pamphlets, novels,
plays, letters, philosophical essays, and histories. His
writings brought him both fame and wealth.
Although he touched on all of the themes of importance to the philosophes, Voltaire was especially well
known for his criticism of traditional religion and his
strong attachment to the ideal of religious toleration (see
the box on p. 363). He lent his prestige and skills as a
polemicist to fight intolerance in France. In 1763, he
penned his Treatise on Toleration, in which he argued that
religious toleration had created no problems for England
and Holland and reminded governments that ‘‘all men are
brothers under God.’’ As he grew older, Voltaire became
ever more strident in his denunciations. ‘‘Crush the infamous thing,’’ he thundered repeatedly---the infamous thing
being religious fanaticism, intolerance, and superstition.
Throughout his life, Voltaire championed not only
religious tolerance but also deism, a religious outlook
shared by most other philosophes. Deism was built on the
Newtonian world-machine, which conceived of the universe as a huge, regulated, and uniform machine that
operated on impersonal natural laws. To the deists, reason
dictated that such an elegant design of the universe implied the existence of a mechanic (God) who had created
it and allowed it to run according to its natural laws. The
universe was like a clock. God, the clockmaker, had
created it, set it in motion, and allowed it to run without
interference. To Voltaire and most other philosophes, God
had no direct involvement in the world he had created.
They rejected religious miracles and Jesus’ resurrection,
important elements of Christian belief, as contrary to the
laws of nature. Jesus may have been a ‘‘good fellow,’’ as
Voltaire called him, but he was not divine as Christianity
claimed.
Diderot and the Encyclopedia Denis Diderot (1713--
1784), the son of a skilled craftsman from eastern France,
decided to become a writer so that he could be free to
study and read in many subjects and languages. One of
his favorite topics was Christianity, which he condemned
as fanatical and unreasonable. As he grew older, his literary attacks on Christianity grew more vicious. Of all
religions, Christianity, he maintained, was the worst, ‘‘the
most absurd and the most atrocious in its dogma.’’ This
progression reflected his own movement from deism to
atheism, ending with a basic materialistic conception of
life: ‘‘This world is only a mass of molecules.’’
Diderot’s most famous contribution to the Enlightenment was the twenty-eight-volume Encyclopedia, or
Classified Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Trades,
which he edited and referred to as the ‘‘great work of his
life.’’ Its purpose, he said, was to ‘‘change the general way
of thinking.’’ It did precisely that, becoming a major
weapon of the philosophes’ crusade against the old
French society. The contributors included many philosophes, who expressed their major concerns. They attacked religious superstition and advocated toleration as
well as a program for social, legal, and political improvements that would lead to a society that was more
cosmopolitan, more tolerant, more humane, and more
reasonable. In later editions, the price of the Encyclopedia
was drastically reduced, dramatically increasing its sales
and making it available to doctors, clergymen, teachers,
lawyers, and even military officers. The ideas of the Enlightenment spread even further as a result.
Toward a New ‘‘Science of Man’’ The Enlightenment
belief that Newton’s scientific methods could be used to
discover the natural laws underlying all areas of human
life led to the emergence in the eighteenth century of what
the philosophes called a ‘‘science of man’’ or what we
would call the social sciences. In a number of areas,
philosophes arrived at natural laws that they believed
governed human actions.
The Physiocrats and Adam Smith have been regarded
as founders of the modern discipline of economics. The
leader of the Physiocrats was Franc¸ois Quesnay (1694--
1774), a successful French court physician. Quesnay and
the Physiocrats claimed they would discover the natural
economic laws that governed human society. Their major
‘‘natural law’’ of economics was a repudiation of mercantilism, specifically its emphasis on a controlled economy for the benefit of the state. Instead the Physiocrats
stressed that the existence of the natural economic forces
of supply and demand made it imperative that individuals should be left free to pursue their own economic self-interest. In doing so, all of society would
ultimately benefit. Consequently, they argued that the
state should in no way interrupt the free play of natural
economic forces by government regulation of the economy but rather just leave it alone, a doctrine that subsequently became known by the French term laissez-faire
(‘‘let it alone’’).
The clearest statement of laissez-faire was made by a
Scottish philosopher, Adam Smith (1723--1790), in his
Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of
Nations, known simply as The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776. Like the Physiocrats, Smith believed that
the state should not interfere in economic matters; indeed, he gave to government only three basic functions:
to protect society from invasion (army), to defend individuals from injustice and oppression (police), and to
keep up public works, such as roads and canals, that
private individuals could not afford. Thus in Smith’s view,
the state should be a kind of ‘‘passive policeman’’ that
remains out of the lives of individuals. In emphasizing the
economic liberty of the individual, the Physiocrats and
Adam Smith laid the foundation for what became known
in the nineteenth century as economic liberalism.
The Later Enlightenment By the late 1760s, a new
generation of philosophes who had grown up with the
worldview of the Enlightenment began to move beyond
their predecessors’ beliefs. Baron Paul d’Holbach (1723--
1789), a wealthy German aristocrat who settled in Paris,
preached a doctrine of strict atheism and materialism. In
his System of Nature, written in 1770, he argued that
everything in the universe consisted of matter in motion.
Human beings were simply machines; God was a product
of the human mind and was unnecessary for leading a
moral life. People needed only reason to live in this world.
Holbach shocked almost all of his fellow philosophes with
his uncompromising atheism. Most intellectuals remained
more comfortable with deism and feared the effect of
atheism on society.
No one was more critical of the work of his predecessors than Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712--1778). Almost
entirely self-educated, Rousseau, born in Geneva, Switzerland, spent a wandering existence as a youth, holding
various jobs in France and Italy. Eventually he made his
way to Paris, where he was introduced into the circles of
the philosophes.
Rousseau’s political beliefs were presented in two
major works. In his Discourse on the Origins of the Inequality of Mankind, Rousseau argued that people had
adopted laws and governors to protect their private
property, but in the process, they had become enslaved by
government. In his most celebrated treatise, The Social
Contract, published in 1762, Rousseau tried to harmonize
individual liberty with governmental authority (see the
box on p. 365). The social contract was basically an
agreement on the part of an entire society to be governed
by its general will. If any individual wished to follow his
own self-interest, he should be forced to abide by the
general will. ‘‘This means nothing less than that he will be
forced to be free,’’ Rousseau said, because the general will
represented a community’s highest aspirations, what was
best for the entire community. Thus liberty was achieved
through being forced to follow what was best for all
people because, he believed, what was best for all was best
for each individual. To Rousseau, because everybody was
responsible for framing the general will, the creation of
laws could never be delegated to a parliamentary body:
Thus the people’s deputies are not and could not be its
representatives; they are merely its agents; and they cannot
decide anything finally. Any law which the people has not
ratified in person is void; it is not law at all. The English
people believes itself to be free; it is gravely mistaken; it is
free only during the election of Members of Parliament; as
soon as the Members are elected, the people is enslaved; it is
nothing.4
This is an extreme, idealistic statement, but it is the ultimate
statement of participatory democracy.
Another influential treatise by Rousseau also appeared in 1762. Titled E´mile, it is one of the Enlightenment’s most important works on education. Written in
the form of a novel, the work was really a general treatise
‘‘on the education of the natural man.’’ Rousseau’s fundamental concern was that education should encourage
rather than restrict children’s natural instincts. Life’s experiences had shown Rousseau the importance of the
promptings of the heart, and what he sought was a balance
between heart and mind, between sentiment and reason.
This emphasis on heart and sentiment made him a precursor of the intellectual movement called Romanticism
that dominated Europe at the beginning of the nineteenth
century.
But Rousseau did not necessarily practice what he
preached. His own children were sent to foundling
homes, where many children died young. Rousseau also
viewed women as ‘‘naturally’’ different from men: ‘‘to
fulfill [a woman’s] functions, an appropriate physical
constitution is necessary to her. . . . She needs a soft
sedentary life to suckle her babies. How much care and
tenderness does she need to hold her family together?’’ In
E´mile, Sophie, E´mile’s intended wife, was educated for her
role as wife and mother by learning obedience and the
nurturing skills that would enable her to provide loving
care for her husband and children. Not everyone in
the eighteenth century, however, agreed with Rousseau,
making ideas of gender an important issue in the
Enlightenment.
The ‘‘Woman Question’’ in the Enlightenment For
centuries, men had dominated the debate about the
nature and value of women. In general, many male intellectuals had argued that the base nature of women
made them inferior to men and made male domination of
women necessary (see Chapter 16). In the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, many male thinkers reinforced this
view by arguing that it was based on ‘‘natural’’ biological
differences between men and women. Like Rousseau, they
argued that the female constitution made women suitable
only as mothers. Male writers, in particular, were critical
of the attempts of some women in the Enlightenment to
write on intellectual issues, arguing that women by nature
were intellectually inferior to men. Nevertheless, there
were some Enlightenment thinkers who offered more
positive views of women. Diderot, for example, maintained that men and women were not all that different,
and Voltaire asserted that ‘‘women are capable of all that
men are’’ with regard to intellectual activity.
It was women thinkers, however, who added new
perspectives to the ‘‘woman question’’ by making specific
suggestions for improving the conditions of women.
Mary Astell (1666--1731), daughter of a wealthy English
coal merchant, argued in 1697 in A Serious Proposal to the
Ladies that women needed to become better educated.
Men, she believed, would resent her proposal, ‘‘but they
must excuse me, if I be as partial to my own sex as they
are to theirs, and think women as capable of learning as
men are, and that it becomes them as well.’’5
The strongest statement for the rights of women in
the eighteenth century was advanced by the English writer
Mary Wollstonecraft (1759--1797), viewed by many as the
founder of modern European feminism. In Vindication of
the Rights of Woman, written in 1792, Wollstonecraft
pointed out two contradictions in the views of women
held by such Enlightenment thinkers as Rousseau. To
argue that women must obey men, she said, was contrary
to the beliefs of the same individuals that a system based
on the arbitrary power of monarchs over their subjects or
slave owners over their slaves was wrong. The subjection
of women to men was equally wrong. In addition, she
argued that the Enlightenment was based on an ideal of
reason innate in all human beings. If women have reason,
then they too are entitled to the same rights that men
have. Women, Wollstonecraft declared, should have equal
rights with men in education and in economic and
political life as well (see the box on p. 367).
The Social Environment of the Philosophes
The social backgrounds of the philosophes varied considerably, from the aristocratic Montesquieu to the
lower-middle-class Diderot and Rousseau. The Enlightenment was not the preserve of any one class, although
obviously its greatest appeal was to the aristocracy and
upper middle classes of the major cities. The common
people, especially the peasants, were little affected by the
Enlightenment.
Of great importance to the Enlightenment was the
spread of its ideas to the literate elite of European society.
Although the publication and sale of books and treatises
were crucial to this process, the salon was also a factor.
Salons came into being in the seventeenth century but
rose to new heights in the eighteenth. These were elegant
drawing rooms in the urban houses of the wealthy where
philosophes and guests gathered to engage in witty,
sparkling conversations that often centered on the ideas
of the philosophes. In France’s rigid hierarchical society,
the salons were important in bringing together writers
and artists with aristocrats, government officials, and
wealthy members of the bourgeoisie.
As hostesses of the salons, women found themselves
in a position to affect the decisions of kings, sway political
opinion, and influence literary and artistic taste. Salons
provided havens for people and views unwelcome in the
royal court. When Diderot’s Encyclopedia was suppressed
by the French authorities, Marie-The´re`se de Geoffrin
(1699--1777), a wealthy bourgeois widow whose father
had been a valet, welcomed the encyclopedists to her
salon and offered financial assistance to complete the
work in secret. Madame Geoffrin was not without rivals,
however. The marquise du Deffand (1697--1780) had
abandoned her husband in the provinces and established
herself in Paris, where her ornate drawing room attracted
many of the Enlightenment’s great figures, including
Montesquieu and Voltaire.
Although the salons were run by women, the reputation of a salon depended on the stature of the males a
hostess was able to attract. Despite this male domination,
however, both French and foreign observers complained
that females exerted undue influence in French political
affairs. Though exaggerated, this perception led to the
decline of salons during the French Revolution toward the
end of the century.
The salon served an important role in making possible conversation and sociability between upper-class
men and women as well as spreading the ideas of the
Enlightenment. But other means of spreading Enlightenment ideas were also available. Bistros, cafe´s, reading
clubs, and public lending libraries established by the state
were gathering places to exchange ideas. Secret societies
also developed. The most famous was the Freemasons,
established in London in 1717, France and Italy in 1726,
and Prussia in 1744. It was no secret that the Freemasons
were sympathetic to the ideas of the philosophes.
Culture and Society
in the Enlightenment
Q Focus Questions: What innovations in art, music, and
literature occurred in the eighteenth century? How
did popular culture differ from high culture in the
eighteenth century?
The intellectual adventure fostered by the philosophes
was accompanied by both traditional practices and
important changes in eighteenth-century culture and
society.
Innovations in Art, Music, and Literature
Although the Baroque and neoclassical styles that had
dominated the seventeenth century continued into the
eighteenth century, by the 1730s a new style known as
Rococo began to affect decoration and architecture all
over Europe. Unlike the Baroque, which stressed majesty,
power, and movement, Rococo emphasized grace and
gentle action. Rococo rejected strict geometrical patterns
and favored curves; it liked to follow the wandering lines
of natural objects, such as seashells and flowers. It made
much use of interlaced designs colored in gold with
delicate contours and graceful curves. Highly secular, its
lightness and charm spoke of the pursuit of pleasure,
happiness, and love.
Some of Rococo’s appeal is evident in the work of the
French painter Antoine Watteau (1684--1721), whose
lyrical views of aristocratic life---refined, sensual, civilized,
with gentlemen and ladies in elegant dress---revealed a
world of upper-class pleasure and joy. Underneath that
exterior, however, was an element of sadness as the artist
revealed the fragility and transitory nature of pleasure,
love, and life.
Another aspect of Rococo was that its decorative
work could easily be used with Baroque architecture.
The palace of Versailles had an enormous impact on
Europe. ‘‘Keeping up with the Bourbons’’ became important as the Austrian emperor, the Swedish king, German princes, Italian princes, and even a Russian tsar built
grandiose palaces. While imitating Versailles in size, they
were modeled less after the French Classical style of
Versailles than after the seventeenth-century Italian Baroque, as modified by a series of brilliant German and
Austrian sculptor-architects. This Baroque-Rococo architectural style of the eighteenth century was used in
both palaces and churches, and often the same architects
designed both. This is evident in the work of one of the
greatest architects of the eighteenth century, Balthasar
Neumann (1687--1753).
Neumann’s two masterpieces are the pilgrimage
church of the Vierzehnheiligen (Fourteen Saints) in
southern Germany and the palace known as the Residenz,
the home of the Scho¨nborn prince-bishop of Wu¨rzburg.
Secular and spiritual become easily interchangeable as
lavish and fanciful ornament, light, bright colors, and
elaborate and rich detail greet the eye in both buildings.
The Development of Music The eighteenth century
was one of the greatest in the history of European music.
In the first half of the century, two composers---Handel
and Bach---stand out as musical geniuses. Johann
Sebastian Bach (1685--1750) came from a family of musicians. Bach served as organist and music director at a
number of small German courts before becoming director
of liturgical music at the church of Saint Thomas in
Leipzig in 1723. There Bach composed his Mass in B
Minor, his Saint Matthew’s Passion, and the cantatas and
motets that have established his reputation as one of
the greatest composers of all time. Above all for Bach,
music was a means to worship God; in his own
words, his task in life was to make ‘‘well-ordered music in
the honor of God.’’
The other great musical giant of the early eighteenth
century, George Frederick Handel (1685--1759), was, like
Bach, born in Saxony in Germany and in the same year.
Unlike Bach, however, he was profoundly secular in
temperament. After studying in Italy, where he began his
career writing operas in the Italian manner, in 1712 he
moved to England, where he spent most of his adult life
trying to run an operatic company. Although patronized
by the English royal court, Handel wrote music for large
public audiences and was not adverse to writing ambitious, unusual-sounding pieces. The band for his Fireworks Music, for example, was supposed to be accompanied
by 101 cannons. Although he wrote much secular music,
ironically, the worldly Handel is probably best known
for his religious creations. His Messiah has been called
‘‘one of those rare works that appeal immediately to
everyone, and yet is indisputably a masterpiece of the
highest order.’’6
Bach and Handel perfected the Baroque musical
style, with its monumental and elaborate musical structures. Two geniuses of the second half of the eighteenth
century---Haydn and Mozart---were innovators who wrote
music called classical rather than Baroque. Their renown
caused the musical center of Europe to shift from Italy to
the Austrian Empire.
Franz Joseph Haydn (1732--1809) spent most of his
adult life as musical director for wealthy Hungarian
princes, the Esterhazy brothers. Haydn was incredibly
prolific, composing 104 symphonies in addition to
string quartets, concerti, songs, oratorios, and Masses. His
visits to England in 1790 and 1794 introduced him to a
world where musicians wrote for public concerts rather
than for princely patrons. This ‘‘liberty,’’ as he called it,
induced him to write his two great oratorios, The Creation and The Seasons, both of which were dedicated to the
common people.
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756--1791), born in
Salzburg, Austria, was a child prodigy who gave his first
harpsichord concert at six and wrote his first opera at
twelve. He, too, sought a patron, but his discontent with
the overly demanding archbishop of Salzburg forced him
to move to Vienna, where his failure to find a permanent
patron made his life miserable. Nevertheless, he wrote
music prolifically and passionately---string quartets, sonatas, symphonies, concerti, and operas---until he
died at thirty-five, a debt-ridden pauper. The Marriage of Figaro, The Magic Flute, and Don Giovanni
are three of the world’s greatest operas. Mozart composed
with an ease of melody and a blend of grace and precision
that arguably no one has ever surpassed.
Development of the Novel The eighteenth century was
also decisive in the development of the novel. The
modern novel grew out of the medieval romances and the
picaresque stories of the sixteenth century. The English
are credited with establishing the novel as the primary
form of fiction writing. With no established rules, the
novel was open to much experimentation.
The High Culture of the Eighteenth Century
Historians and cultural anthropologists have grown accustomed to distinguishing between a civilization’s high
culture and its popular culture. High culture usually
means the literary and artistic world of the educated and
wealthy ruling classes; popular culture refers to the
written and unwritten lore of the masses, most of which is
passed down orally. By the eighteenth century, European
high culture consisted of a learned world of theologians,
scientists, philosophers, intellectuals, poets, and dramatists, for whom Latin remained a living and truly international language. Their work was supported by a wealthy
and literate lay group, the most important of whom were
the landed aristocracy and the wealthier upper classes
in the cities.
Especially notable in the eighteenth century was an
expansion of both the reading public and publishing.
One study revealed that French publishers were issuing
about sixteen hundred titles yearly in the 1780s, up
from three hundred titles in 1750. Though many of
these titles were still aimed at small groups of the educated elite, some were also directed to the new reading
public of the middle classes, which included women and
urban artisans. The growth of publishing houses made it
possible for authors to make money from their works
and be less dependent on wealthy patrons.
An important aspect of the growth of publishing and
reading in the eighteenth century was the development of
magazines for the general public. Great Britain, an important center for the new magazines, saw 25 periodicals
published in 1700, 103 in 1760, and 158 in 1780. Along
with magazines came daily newspapers. The first was
printed in London in 1702, but by 1780, thirty-seven
other English towns had their own newspapers. Filled
with news and special features, they were relatively cheap
and were available free of charge in coffeehouses.
Popular Culture
Popular culture refers to the written and unwritten literature and the social activities and pursuits that are
fundamental to the lives of most people in a society. The
distinguishing characteristic of popular culture is its
collective and public nature. Group activity was especially
evident in the festival, a broad name used to cover a
variety of celebrations: community festivals in Catholic
Europe that celebrated the feast day of the local patron
saint; annual festivals, such as Christmas and Easter, that
go back to medieval Christianity; and Carnival, which was
celebrated in Spain, Italy, France, Germany, and Austria.
All of these festivals were special occasions on which
people ate, drank, and celebrated to excess. In traditional
societies, festival was a time for relaxation and enjoyment
because much of the rest of the year was taken up with
unrelieved work. As the poet Thomas Gray in 1739 said of
Carnival in Turin: ‘‘This Carnival lasts only from
Christmas to Lent; one half of the remaining part of the
year is passed in remembering the last, the other in expecting the future Carnival.’’7
Carnival began around the start of the year and lasted
until the first day of Lent, the forty-day period of fasting
and purification leading up to Easter. Because people were
expected to abstain from meat, sex, and most recreations
during Lent, Carnival was a time of great indulgence.
Hearty consumption of food, especially meat and other
delicacies, and heavy drinking were the norm. Carnival was
a time of intense sexual activity as well. Songs with double
meanings could be sung publicly at this time of year,
whereas at other times they would be considered offensive.
A float of Florentine key makers, for example, sang this
ditty to the ladies: ‘‘Our tools are fine, new and useful. / We
always carry them with us. / They are good for anything. / If
you want to touch them, you can.’’ Finally, Carnival was a
time of aggression, a time to release pent-up feelings. Most
often this took the form of verbal aggression, since people
were allowed to openly insult other people and even to
criticize their social superiors and authorities.
The same sense of community evident in festival was
also present in the chief gathering places of the common
people, the local taverns or cabarets. Taverns functioned
as a regular gathering place for neighborhood men to
talk, play games, conduct small business matters, and of
course drink. In some countries, the favorite drinks of
poor people, such as gin in England and vodka in Russia,
proved devastating as poor people regularly drank
themselves into oblivion. Gin was cheap; the classic sign
in English taverns, ‘‘Drunk for a penny, dead drunk for
two pence,’’ was literally true. In England, the consumption of gin rose from 2 million to 5 million gallons between 1714 and 1733 and declined only when complaints
finally led to laws to restrict sales in the 1750s.
In the eighteenth century, the gulf between elite and
poor grew ever wider. In 1500, popular culture was for
everyone, including members of the aristocracy. But between 1500 and 1800, the nobility, clergy, and bourgeoisie
gradually abandoned popular culture to the lower classes.
By abandoning the popular festivals, the upper classes
were also cutting themselves off from the popular
worldview as well. Their new scientific outlook led them
to regard such things as witchcraft, faith healing, fortunetelling, and prophecy as the beliefs of people, as one writer
said, ‘‘of the weakest judgment and reason, as women,
children, and ignorant and superstitious persons.’’
Crime and Punishment
By the eighteenth century, most European states had
developed a hierarchy of courts to deal with crimes. Except in England, judicial torture remained an important
means of obtaining evidence before a trial. Courts used
the rack, thumbscrews, and other instruments to obtain
confessions in criminal cases. Punishments for crimes
were often cruel and even spectacular. Public executions
were a basic part of traditional punishment and were
regarded as a necessary means of deterring potential offenders in an age when a state’s police arm was too weak
to ensure the capture of criminals. Although nobles were
executed by simple beheading, lower-class criminals
condemned to death were tortured, broken on the wheel,
or drawn (eviscerated) and quartered. The death penalty
was still commonly used in property as well as criminal
cases. By 1800, more than two hundred crimes were
subject to the death penalty in England. In addition to
executions, European states resorted to forced labor in
mines, forts, and navies. England also sent criminals as
indentured servants to colonies in the New World and,
after American independence, to Australia.
Appalled by the unjust laws and brutal punishments
of their times, some philosophes had sought to create a
new approach to justice. The most notable effort was
made by the Italian philosophe Cesare Beccaria (1738--
1794). In his essay On Crimes and Punishments, written in
1764, Beccaria argued that punishments should serve only
as deterrents, not as exercises in brutality: ‘‘Such
punishments . . . ought to be chosen as will make the
strongest and most lasting impressions on the minds of
others, with the least torment to the body of the criminal.’’8 Beccaria was also opposed to the use of capital
punishment. It was spectacular but failed to stop others
from committing crimes. Imprisonment, the deprivation
of freedom, made a far more lasting impression. Moreover, capital punishment was harmful to society because it
set an example of barbarism: ‘‘Is it not absurd, that the
laws, which detest and punish homicide, should, in order
to prevent murder, publicly commit murder themselves?’’9
By the end of the eighteenth century, a growing
sentiment against executions and torture led to a decline
in both corporal and capital punishment. A new type of
prison, in which criminals were placed in cells and subjected to discipline and regular work to rehabilitate
them, began to replace the public spectacle of barbarous
punishments.
Religion and the Churches
Q Focus Question: How did popular religion differ from
institutional religion in the eighteenth century?
The music of Bach and the pilgrimage and monastic
churches of southern Germany and Austria make us
aware of a curious fact. While much of the great art and
music of the time was religious, the thought of the time
was antireligious as life became increasingly secularized
and men of reason attacked the established churches. And
yet most Europeans were still Christians. Even many of
those most critical of the churches accepted that society
could not function without religious faith.
The Institutional Church
In the eighteenth century, the established Catholic and
Protestant churches were basically conservative institutions that upheld society’s hierarchical structure,
privileged classes, and traditions. Although churches experienced change because of new state policies, they did
not sustain any dramatic internal changes. In both
Catholic and Protestant countries, the parish church run
by priest or pastor remained the center of religious
practice. In addition to providing religious services, the
parish church kept records of births, deaths, and marriages, provided charity for the poor, supervised whatever
primary education there was, and cared for orphans.
Toleration and Religious Minorities
One of the chief battle cries of the philosophes had been a
call for religious toleration. Out of political necessity, a
certain level of tolerance of different creeds had occurred
in the seventeenth century, but many rulers still found it
difficult to accept. Even devout rulers continued to believe that there was only one path to salvation; it was the
true duty of a ruler not to allow subjects to be condemned
to hell by being heretics. Persecution of heretics continued; the last burning of a heretic took place in 1781.
The Jews remained the despised religious minority
of Europe. The largest number of Jews (known as the
Ashkenazic Jews) lived in eastern Europe. Except in relatively tolerant Poland, Jews were restricted in their
movements, forbidden to own land or hold certain jobs,
forced to pay burdensome special taxes, and subject to
periodic outbursts of popular wrath. The resulting pogroms, in which Jewish communities were looted and
massacred, made Jewish existence precarious and dependent on the favor of their territorial rulers.
Another major group was the Sephardic Jews who
had been expelled from Spain in the fifteenth century.
Although many had migrated to the Ottoman Empire,
some had settled in cities such as Amsterdam, Venice,
London, and Frankfurt, where they were relatively free
to engage in the banking and commercial activities that
Jews had conducted since the Middle Ages. The highly
successful ones came to provide valuable services to rulers, especially in central Europe. But even these Jews were
insecure because their religion set them apart from the
Christian majority and served as a catalyst for social
resentment.
Some Enlightenment thinkers in the eighteenth
century favored a new acceptance of Jews. They argued
that Jews and Muslims were human and deserved the full
rights of citizenship despite their religion. Many philosophes denounced persecution of the Jews but made no
attempt to hide their hostility and ridiculed Jewish customs. Diderot, for example, said that the Jews had ‘‘all the
defects peculiar to an ignorant and superstitious nation.’’
Many Europeans favored assimilation of the Jews into the
mainstream of society, but only through the conversion of
Jews to Christianity. This, of course, was not acceptable to
most Jews.
The Austrian emperor Joseph II (1780--1790) attempted to adopt a new policy toward the Jews, although
it was limited. It freed Jews from nuisance taxes and allowed them more freedom of movement and job opportunities, but they were still prohibited from owning
land and worshiping in public. At the same time, Joseph
encouraged Jews to learn German and to work toward
greater assimilation into Austrian society.
Popular Religion in the Eighteenth Century
Despite the rise of skepticism and the intellectuals’ belief
in deism and natural religion, religious devotion remained strong in the eighteenth century. It is difficult to
assess precisely the religiosity of Europe’s Catholics. The
Catholic parish church remained a center of life for the
entire community. How many people went to church
regularly cannot be known exactly, but 90 to 95 percent of
Catholic populations did go to Mass on Easter Sunday,
one of the church’s most important celebrations.
After the initial century of religious fervor that gave
rise to Protestantism in the sixteenth century, Protestant
churches in the seventeenth century had settled down
into established patterns controlled by state authorities
and served by a well-educated clergy. Protestant churches
became bureaucratized and bereft of religious enthusiasm. In Germany and England, where rationalism and
deism had become influential and moved some theologians to a more ‘‘rational’’ Christianity, the desire of
ordinary Protestant churchgoers for greater depths of
religious experience led to new and dynamic religious
movements.
One of the most famous movements---Methodism---
was the work of John Wesley (1703--1791). An ordained
Anglican minister, Wesley underwent a mystical experience in which ‘‘the gift of God’s grace’’ assured him of
salvation and led him to become a missionary to the
English people, bringing the ‘‘glad tidings’’ of salvation to
all people, despite opposition from the Anglican church,
which criticized this emotional mysticism or religious
enthusiasm as superstitious nonsense. To Wesley, all could
be saved by experiencing God and opening the doors to
his grace.
In taking the Gospel to the people, Wesley preached
to the masses in open fields, appealing especially to the
lower classes neglected by the socially elitist Anglican
church. He tried, he said, ‘‘to lower religion to the level of
the lowest people’s capacities.’’ Wesley’s charismatic
preaching often provoked highly charged and even violent
conversion experiences (see the box on p. 374). Afterward, converts were organized into so-called Methodist
societies or chapels in which they could aid each other in
doing the good works that Wesley considered a component of salvation. Although Wesley sought to keep
Methodism within the Anglican church, after his death it
became a separate and independent sect. Methodism
represented an important revival of Christianity and
proved that the need for spiritual experience had not been
extinguished by the eighteenth-century search for reason.

CONCLUSION
The eighteenth was a century of change but also of tradition. Highly
influenced by the new worldview ushered in by the Scientific
Revolution and especially the ideas of Locke and Newton, the
philosophes hoped that they could create a new society by using
reason to discover the natural laws that governed it. Like the
Christian humanists of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, they
believed that education could produce better human beings and a
better human society. By attacking traditional religion as the enemy
and creating the new ‘‘sciences of man’’ in economics, politics, and
justice, the philosophes laid the foundation for a modern worldview
based on rationalism and secularism.
But despite the secular thought and rational ideas that began
to penetrate the minds of the elites, most people in eighteenthcentury Europe still lived by seemingly eternal verities and
practices---God, religious worship, and farming. The most brilliant
architecture and music of the age were religious. And yet the forces
of secularization were too strong to stop. In the midst of intellectual
change, economic, political, and social transformations of great
purport were taking shape and would lead to both political and
industrial upheavals before the century’s end. It is time now to
examine the political, economic, and social traditions and changes
of the century.
