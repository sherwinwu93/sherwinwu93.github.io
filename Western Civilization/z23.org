In the late nineteenth century, Europe was enjoying a dynamic age of material prosperity. Bringing new industries,
new sources of energy, and new goods, a second Industrial Revolution transformed the environment, dazzled Europeans, and led them
to believe that their material progress was human progress. Scientific
and technological achievements, many naively believed, would improve the human condition and solve all problems. The doctrine of
progress became an article of faith.
The new urban and industrial environment resulting from the
rapid economic changes of the nineteenth century led to the emergence of a mass society. With it came improvements for the lower
classes, who benefited from the extension of voting rights, a better
standard of living, and free education. It also brought mass leisure.
New work patterns established the ‘‘weekend’’ as a distinct time of
recreation and fun, while new forms of mass transportation---railroads
and streetcars---enabled even the lowest-paid workers to make brief
excursions to beaches and amusement parks. Coney Island was only
8 miles from central New York City; Blackpool in England was a
short train ride from nearby industrial towns. With their Ferris
wheels and other daring rides that threw young men and women together, amusement parks offered a whole new world of entertainment.
Thanks to the railroad, seaside resorts, once the preserve of the
wealthy, became accessible to more people for weekend visits, much
to the disgust of one upper-class regular who described the new
‘‘day-trippers’’: ‘‘They swarm upon the beach, wandering listlessly
about with apparently no other aim than to get a mouthful of fresh
air.’’ Entrepreneurs in resort areas, however, welcomed the masses of
new visitors and built piers laden with food, drink, and entertainment
to serve them.
The coming of mass society also created new roles for the
governments of European nation-states, which now fostered national
loyalty, formed vast armies by conscription, and took more responsibility for public health and housing measures in their cities. By
1871, the national state had become the focus of Europeans’ lives.
Within many of these nation-states, the growth of the middle class
had led to the triumph of liberal practices: constitutional governments, parliaments, and principles of equality. The period after 1871
also witnessed the growth of political democracy as the right to vote
was extended to all adult males; women, though, would still have to
fight for their political rights. With political democracy came a new
mass politics and a new mass press. Both would become standard
features of the twentieth century.
The Growth of Industrial
Prosperity
Q Focus Questions: What was the Second Industrial
Revolution, and what effects did it have on European
economic and social life? What roles did socialist
parties and trade unions play in improving conditions
for the working classes?
At the heart of Europeans’ belief in progress after 1871 was
the stunning material growth produced by what historians
have called the Second Industrial Revolution. The original
Industrial Revolution had given rise to textiles, railroads,
iron, and coal. In the second revolution, steel, chemicals,
electricity, and petroleum led the way to new industrial
frontiers.
New Products
The first major change in industrial development after
1870 was the substitution of steel for iron. New methods of
rolling and shaping steel made it useful in the construction
of lighter, smaller, and faster machines and engines, as well
as railways, ships, and armaments. In 1860, Great Britain,
France, Germany, and Belgium produced 125,000 tons of
steel; by 1913, the total was 32 million tons. By 1910,
German steel production was double that of Great Britain,
and both had been surpassed by the United States in 1890.
Electricity was a major new form of energy that
proved to be of great value because it could be easily
converted into other forms of energy, such as heat, light,
and motion, and moved relatively effortlessly through
wires. The first commercially practical generators of electrical current were developed in the 1870s. By 1910, hydroelectric power stations and coal-fired steam-generating
plants enabled entire districts to be tied in to a single
power distribution system that provided a common source
of power for homes, shops, and industrial enterprises.
Electricity spawned spectacular new products. The
invention of the lightbulb by the American Thomas
Edison and the Briton Joseph Swan opened homes and
cities to illumination by electric lights. A revolution in
communications was fostered when the American
inventor Alexander Graham Bell devised the telephone
in 1876 and the Italian physicist Guglielmo Marconi sent
the first radio waves across the Atlantic in 1901. Although most electricity was initially used for lighting, it
was eventually put to use in transportation. By the
1880s, electric streetcars and subways had appeared in
major European cities. Electricity also transformed the
factory. Conveyor belts, cranes, machines, and machine
tools could all be powered by electricity and located
anywhere. Thanks to electricity, all countries could now
enter the industrial age.
The development of the internal combustion engine
had a similar effect. The processing of oil and gasoline
made possible the widespread use of the internal combustion engine as a source of power in transportation. An
oil-fired engine was made in 1897, and by 1902, the
Hamburg-Amerika Line had switched from coal to oil on
its new ocean liners. By the end of the nineteenth century,
some naval fleets had been converted to oil burners as
well.
The internal combustion engine gave rise to the automobile and the airplane. In 1900, world production
stood at 9,000 cars; by 1906, Americans had overtaken the
initial lead of the French. It was an American, Henry
Ford, who revolutionized the auto industry with the mass
production of the affordable Model T. By 1916, Ford’s
factories were turning out 735,000 cars a year. In the
meantime, air transportation began with the Zeppelin
airship in 1900. In 1903, at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina,
the Wright brothers, Orville and Wilbur, made the first
flight in a fixed-wing plane powered by a gasoline engine.
It took World War I to stimulate the aircraft industry,
however, and regular passenger air service did not begin
until 1919.
New Markets
The growth of industrial production depended on the
development of markets for the sale of manufactured
goods. After 1870, the best foreign markets were already
heavily saturated, forcing Europeans to take a renewed
look at their domestic markets. Between 1850 and 1900,
real wages increased by two-thirds in Britain and by onethird in Germany. As the prices of both food and manufactured goods declined due to lower transportation
costs, Europeans could spend more on consumer products. Businesses soon perceived the value of using new
techniques of mass marketing to sell the consumer goods
made possible by the development of the steel and electrical industries. Bringing together a vast array of new
products in one place, they created the department store
(see the box on p. 487). The desire to own sewing machines, clocks, bicycles, electric lights, and typewriters
created a new consumer ethic that rapidly became a
crucial part of the modern economy.
Meanwhile, increased competition for foreign markets and the growing importance of domestic demand led
to a reaction against the free trade that had characterized
much of the European economy between 1820 and 1870.
To many industrial and political leaders, protective tariffs
guaranteed domestic markets for the products of their
own industries. By the 1870s, Europeans were returning
to tariff protection. At the same time, cartels were being
formed to decrease competition internally. In a cartel,
independent enterprises worked together to control prices
and fix production quotas, thereby restraining the kind of
competition that led to reduced prices.
The formation of cartels was paralleled by a move
toward ever-larger factories, especially in the iron and steel,
machine, heavy electrical equipment, and chemical industries. This growth in the size of industrial plants led to
pressure for greater efficiency in factory production at the
same time that competition led to demands for greater
economy. The result was a desire to streamline or rationalize production as much as possible. The development of
precision tools enabled manufacturers to produce interchangeable parts, which in turn led to the creation of the
assembly line for production. First used in the United
States for small arms and clocks, the assembly line had
moved to Europe by 1850. In the second half of the
nineteenth century, it was primarily used in manufacturing
nonmilitary goods, such as sewing machines, typewriters,
bicycles, and finally automobiles.
New Patterns in an Industrial Economy
The Second Industrial Revolution played a role in the
emergence of basic economic patterns that have characterized much of modern European economic life. Although the period after 1871 has been characterized as
an age of material prosperity, recessions and crises were
still very much a part of economic life. From 1873 to
1895, Europeans experienced a series of economic crises.
Prices, especially those of agricultural products, fell
dramatically. After 1895, however, until World War I,
Europe overall experienced an economic boom and
achieved a level of prosperity that encouraged people
later to look back to that era as la belle e´poque---a golden
age in European civilization.
After 1870, Germany replaced Great Britain as the
industrial leader of Europe. Already in the 1890s, Germany’s superiority was evident in new areas of manufacturing, such as organic chemicals and electrical equipment,
and was increasingly apparent in its ever-greater share of
worldwide trade. But the struggle for economic (and political) supremacy between Great Britain and Germany
should not cause us to overlook the other great polarization of the age. By 1900, Europe was divided into two
economic zones. Great Britain, Belgium, France, the
Netherlands, Germany, the western part of the AustroHungarian Empire, and northern Italy constituted an advanced industrialized core that had a high standard of
living, decent systems of transportation, and relatively
healthy and educated populations (see Map 23.1). The
backward and little industrialized areas to the south and
east, consisting of southern Italy, most of Austria-Hungary,
Spain, Portugal, the Balkan kingdoms, and Russia, were
still largely agricultural and relegated by the industrial
countries to the function of providing food and raw materials. The presence of Romanian oil, Greek olive oil, and
Serbian pigs and prunes in western Europe served as
reminders of an economic division of Europe that continued well into the twentieth century.
The Spread of Industrialization After 1870, industrialization began to spread beyond western and central
Europe and North America. Especially noticeable was its
rapid development in Japan and Russia (see Chapter 24).
In Japan, the imperial government took the lead in promoting industry. The government financed industries,
built railroads, brought foreign experts to train Japanese
employees in new industrial techniques, and instituted a
universal educational system based on applied science. By
the end of the nineteenth century, Japan had developed
key industries in tea, silk, armaments, and shipbuilding.
Workers for these industries came from the large number
of people who had abandoned their farms due to severe
hardships in the countryside and had fled to the cities,
where they provided an abundant source of cheap labor.
As in Europe during the early decades of the Industrial Revolution, workers toiled for long hours in the coal
mines and textile mills, often under horrendous conditions. Reportedly, coal miners employed on a small
island in Nagasaki harbor worked naked in temperatures
up to 130 degrees Fahrenheit. If they tried to escape, they
were shot.
A World Economy The economic developments of the
late nineteenth century, combined with the transportation revolution that saw the growth of marine transport
and railroads, also fostered a true world economy. By
1900, Europeans were importing beef and wool from
Argentina and Australia, coffee from Brazil, nitrates from
Chile, iron ore from Algeria, and sugar from Java.
European capital was also invested abroad to develop
railways, mines, electrical power plants, and banks. Of
course, foreign countries also provided markets for the
surplus manufactured goods of Europe. With its capital,
industries, and military might, Europe dominated the
world economy by the end of the nineteenth century.
Women and Work: New Job Opportunities
The Second Industrial Revolution had an enormous impact on the position of women in the labor market.
During the course of the nineteenth century, considerable
controversy erupted over a woman’s ‘‘right to work.’’
Working-class organizations tended to reinforce the underlying ideal of domesticity: women should remain at
home to bear and nurture children and should not be
allowed in the industrial workforce. Working-class men
argued that keeping women out of industrial work would
ensure the moral and physical well-being of families. In
reality, keeping women out of the industrial workforce
simply made it easier to exploit them when they needed
income to supplement their husbands’ wages or to support their families when their husbands were unemployed.
The desperate need to work at times forced women to do
marginal work at home or piecework in sweatshops.
After 1870, however, new job opportunities for
women became available. The development of larger industrial plants and the expansion of government services
created a large number of service or white-collar jobs. The
increased demand for white-collar workers at relatively
low wages coupled with a shortage of male workers led
employers to hire women. Big businesses and retail shops
needed clerks, typists, secretaries, file clerks, and sales
clerks. The expansion of government services created
opportunities for women to be secretaries and telephone
operators and to take jobs in health and social services.
Compulsory education necessitated more teachers, and
the development of modern hospital services opened
opportunities to serve as nurses.
Many of the new white-collar jobs were far from
exciting. The work was routine and, except for teaching
and nursing, required few skills beyond basic literacy.
Although there was little hope for advancement, these
jobs had distinct advantages for the daughters of the
middle classes and especially the upward-aspiring working classes. For some middle-class women, the new jobs
offered freedom from the domestic patterns expected of
them. Moreover, because middle-class women did not
receive an education comparable to men’s, they were
limited in the careers they could pursue. Thus they found
it easier to fill the jobs at the lower end of middle-class
occupations, such as teaching and civil service jobs, especially in the postal service. Most of the new white-collar
jobs, however, were filled by working-class females who
saw their opportunity to escape from the physical labor of
the lower-class world.
Organizing the Working Classes
In the first half of the nineteenth century, many workers
had formed trade unions that had functioned primarily as
mutual aid societies (see Chapter 20). In return for a
small weekly payment, benefits were provided to assist
unemployed workers. In the late nineteenth century, the
desire to improve their working and living conditions led
many industrial workers to form political parties and
labor unions, often based on the ideas of Karl Marx (see
Chapter 22). One of the most important of the workingclass or socialist parties was formed in Germany in 1875.
Socialist Parties Under the direction of its two Marxist
leaders, Wilhelm Liebknecht and August Bebel, the German
Social Democratic Party (SPD) espoused revolutionary
Marxist rhetoric while organizing itself as a mass political
party competing in elections for the Reichstag, the German
parliament. Once in the Reichstag, SPD delegates worked to
enact legislation to improve the condition of the working
class. As Bebel explained, ‘‘Pure negation would not be
accepted by the voters. The masses demand that something
should be done for today irrespective of what will happen
on the morrow.’’1 Despite government efforts to destroy it,
the SPD continued to grow. In 1890, it received 1.5 million
votes and thirty-five seats in the Reichstag. When it got
4 million votes in the 1912 elections, it became the largest
single party in Germany.
Socialist parties also emerged in other European
states, although none proved as successful as the German
Social Democrats. As the socialist parties gained adherents, agitation for an international organization that
would strengthen their position against international
capitalism grew. In 1889, leaders of the various socialist
parties formed the Second International, which was organized as a loose association of national groups. Though
the Second International took some coordinated actions---
for example, it proclaimed May 1 an international labor
day (May Day), to be marked by strikes and mass labor
demonstrations---differences of opinion often wreaked
havoc at the congresses of the organization. Two issues
proved particularly divisive: nationalism and revisionism.
Despite the belief of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels
that ‘‘the working men have no country,’’ in truth socialist
parties varied from country to country and focused on
national concerns and issues. Thus nationalism remained
a much more powerful force than socialism.
Evolutionary Socialism Marxist parties also divided
over the issue of revisionism, also known as evolutionary
socialism. Some Marxists believed in a pure Marxism that
accepted the imminent collapse of capitalism and the need
for socialist ownership of the means of production. But
others rejected the revolutionary approach and argued in a
revisionist direction that the workers must continue to
organize in mass political parties and even work together
with the other progressive elements in a nation to gain
reform. With the extension of the right to vote, workers
were in a better position than ever to achieve their aims
through democratic channels. As the most prominent
revisionist, Eduard Bernstein (1850--1932) argued in his
book Evolutionary Socialism, evolution by democratic means,
not revolution, would achieve the desired goal of socialism. Many socialist parties, including the German Social
Democrats, while spouting revolutionary slogans, followed Bernstein’s gradualist approach.
Trade Unions Workers also formed trade unions to
improve their working conditions. Attempts to organize
the workers did not come until after unions had won the
right to strike in the 1870s. Strikes proved necessary to
achieve the workers’ goals. A walkout by female workers
in the match industry in 1888 and by dockworkers in
London the following year led to the establishment of
trade union organizations for both groups. By 1900, two
million workers were enrolled in British trade unions, and
by the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the number had
risen to between three and four million, although this was
still less than one-fifth of the total workforce. By 1914, its
three million members made the German trade union
movement the largest in Europe after Great Britain’s.
The Emergence of a Mass Society
Q Focus Questions: What is a mass society, and what are
its main characteristics? What role were women
expected to play in society and family life in the latter
part of the nineteenth century, and how closely did
patterns of family life correspond to this ideal?
The new patterns of industrial production, mass consumption, and working-class organization that we identify with the Second Industrial Revolution were only one
aspect of the new mass society that emerged in Europe
after 1871. A larger and vastly improved urban environment, new patterns of social structure, gender issues,
mass education, and mass leisure were also important
features of Europe’s mass society.
Population Growth
The European population increased dramatically between
1850 and 1910, rising from 270 million to more than
460 million (see Table 23.1). After 1880, a noticeable
decline in death rates largely explains the increase. Although the causes of this decline have been debated, two
major factors---medical discoveries and environmental
conditions---stand out. Some historians have stressed the
importance of developments in medical science. Smallpox
vaccinations, for example, were compulsory in many European countries by the mid-1850s. More important were
improvements in the urban environment in the second half
of the nineteenth century that greatly decreased fatalities
from such infectious diseases as diarrhea, dysentery,
typhoid fever, and cholera, which had been spread through
contaminated water supplies and improper elimination of
sewage. Improved nutrition also made a significant difference in the health of the population. The increase in
agricultural productivity combined with improvements in
transportation facilitated the shipment of food supplies
from areas of surplus to regions with poor harvests.
Emigration
Although agricultural and industrial prosperity supported
an increase in population, it could not do so indefinitely,
especially in areas that had little industrialization and
severe overpopulation. Some of the excess labor from
underdeveloped areas migrated to the industrial regions
of Europe (see Map 23.2). By 1913, more than 400,000
Poles were working in the heavily industrialized Ruhr
region of western Germany. But a booming American
economy and cheap shipping fares after 1898 led to
substantial emigration from southern and eastern Europe
to America. In 1880, about half a million people left
Europe each year on average; between 1906 and 1910,
annual departures increased to 1.3 million, many of them
from southern and eastern Europe.
Transformation of the Urban Environment
One of the most important consequences of industrialization and the population explosion of the nineteenth
century was urbanization. In 1800, city dwellers constituted 40 percent of the population in Britain, 25 percent
in France and Germany, and only 10 percent in eastern
Europe. By 1914, urban inhabitants had increased to
80 percent of the population in Britain, 45 percent in
France, 60 percent in Germany, and 30 percent in eastern
Europe. The size of cities also expanded dramatically, especially in industrialized countries. Between 1800 and
1900, London’s population grew from
960,000 to 6.5 million and Berlin’s from
172,000 to 2.7 million.
Urban populations grew faster than the
general population primarily because of the
vast migration from rural areas to cities.
People were driven from the countryside
to the city by sheer economic necessity---
unemployment, land hunger, and physical
want. Urban centers offered something
positive as well, usually ample opportunities
for employment in factories and later in
service trades and professions. But cities
also grew faster in the second half of the
nineteenth century because health and living conditions in them were improving.
Improving Living Conditions In the
1840s, a number of urban reformers, such
as Edwin Chadwick in England and Rudolf Virchow and Solomon Neumann in
Germany, had pointed to filthy living
conditions as the primary cause of epidemic diseases and urged sanitary reforms
to correct the problem. Soon legislative
acts created boards of health that brought
governmental action to bear on public
health issues. Urban medical officers and
building inspectors were authorized to
inspect dwellings for public health hazards. New building regulations made it
more difficult for private contractors to
build shoddy housing. The Public Health
Act of 1875 in Britain, for example, required that all new buildings have running
water and an internal drainage system. For
the first time in Western history, the role
of municipal governments had been expanded to include detailed regulations for
the improvement of the living conditions
of urban dwellers.
Essential to the public health of the
modern European city was the ability to
bring clean water into the city and to expel
sewage from it. The problem of fresh water
was solved by a system of dams and reservoirs that stored the water and aqueducts and tunnels that carried it from the
countryside to the city and into individual
dwellings. By the second half of the nineteenth century, regular private baths became accessible to many people as gas
heaters in the 1860s and later electric
heaters made hot baths possible. The treatment of sewage
was also improved by building mammoth underground
pipes that carried raw sewage far from the city for disposal. Unfortunately, in many places the new underground sewers simply continued to discharge their raw
sewage into what soon became highly polluted lakes and
rivers. Nevertheless, the development of pure water and
sewage systems dramatically improved the public health
of European cities by 1914.
Housing Needs Middle-class reformers who denounced
the unsanitary living conditions of the working classes
also focused on their housing needs. Overcrowded,
disease-ridden slums were viewed as dangerous not only
to physical health but also to the political and moral
health of the entire nation. Victor Huber, the foremost
early German housing reformer, wrote in 1861, ‘‘Certainly
it would not be too much to say that the home is the
communal embodiment of family life. Thus the purity of
the dwelling is almost as important for the family as is the
cleanliness of the body for the individual.’’2 To Huber,
good housing was a prerequisite for a satisfying family
life, one of the ‘‘stabilising elements of society.’’
Early efforts to attack the housing problem emphasized the middle-class, liberal belief in the efficacy of
private enterprise. Reformers such as Huber believed that
the construction of model dwellings renting at a reasonable price would force other private landlords to elevate
their housing standards. A fine example of this approach
was the work of Octavia Hill (see the box above). With
the financial assistance of a friend, she rehabilitated some
old dwellings and constructed new ones to create housing
for 3,500 tenants.
As the number and size of cities continued to mushroom, governments by the 1880s came to the conclusion---
reluctantly---that private enterprise could not solve the
housing crisis. In 1890, a British housing act empowered
local town councils to construct cheap housing for the
working classes. London and Liverpool were the first
communities to take advantage of their new powers.
Similar activity had been set in motion in Germany by
1900. Everywhere, however, these lukewarm measures
failed to do much to meet the real housing needs of the
working classes. In housing as in so many other areas of
life in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,
the liberal principle that the government that governs
least governs best had simply proved untrue. More and
more, governments were stepping into areas of activity
that they would have never touched earlier.
The Social Structure of a Mass Society
At the top of European society stood a wealthy elite, constituting only 5 percent of the population but controlling
30 to 40 percent of its wealth. In the course of the nineteenth century, aristocrats coalesced with the most successful industrialists, bankers, and merchants (the wealthy
upper middle class) to form this new elite. The growth of
big business had produced this group of wealthy plutocrats,
while aristocrats, whose income from landed estates declined, invested in railway shares, public utilities, government bonds, and even businesses.
The Upper Classes Increasingly, aristocrats and plutocrats fused as the wealthy upper middle class purchased
landed estates to join the aristocrats in the pleasures of
country living while the aristocrats bought lavish town
houses for part-time urban life. Common bonds were also
forged when the sons of wealthy middle-class families were
admitted to the elite schools dominated by the children of
the aristocracy. This educated elite, whether aristocratic or
middle class in background, assumed leadership roles in
government bureaucracies and military hierarchies. Marriage also served to unite the two groups. Daughters of
tycoons acquired titles, and aristocratic heirs gained new
sources of cash. Wealthy American heiresses were in special demand. When Consuelo Vanderbilt married the duke
of Marlborough, the new duchess brought £2 million
(approximately $10 million) to her husband.
The Middle Classes The middle classes consisted of a
variety of groups. Below the upper middle class was a
level that included such traditional groups as professionals
in law, medicine, and the civil service as well as moderately
well-to-do industrialists and merchants. The industrial
expansion of the nineteenth century also added new groups
to this segment of the middle class. These included business
managers and new professionals, such as the engineers,
architects, accountants, and chemists who formed professional associations as the symbols of their newfound importance. A lower middle class of small shopkeepers,
traders, manufacturers, and prosperous peasants provided
goods and services for the classes above them.
Standing between the lower middle class and the
lower classes were new groups of white-collar workers
who were the product of the Second Industrial Revolution. They were the bookkeepers, bank tellers, telephone
operators, department store clerks, secretaries, and
traveling salespeople. Although largely propertyless and
often paid only marginally more than skilled laborers,
these white-collar workers were often committed to
middle-class ideals and optimistic about improving their
status.
The individuals in the moderately prosperous and
successful middle classes shared a common lifestyle, and
their values came to dominate much of late-nineteenthcentury society. Members of the middle classes were especially active in preaching their worldview to their
children and to the upper and lower classes of their society. This was especially evident in Victorian Britain,
often considered a model of middle-class society. The
European middle classes embraced and promoted the
importance of progress and science. They believed in hard
work, which they viewed as the primary human good,
open to everyone and guaranteed to have positive results.
They were also regular churchgoers who believed in the
good conduct associated with traditional Christian morality. The middle classes were concerned with propriety,
the right way of doing things. This concern gave rise to an
endless succession of books aimed at the middle-class
market with such titles as The Habits of Good Society and
Don’t: A Manual of Mistakes and Improprieties More or
Less Prevalent in Conduct and Speech.
The Lower Classes Below the middle classes on the
social scale were the working classes of European society,
who made up almost 80 percent of the population. Many
of the members of these classes were landholding peasants, farm laborers, and sharecroppers, especially in
eastern Europe. The urban working class consisted of
many different groups, including skilled artisans in such
trades as cabinetmaking and printing and semiskilled
laborers such as carpenters and many factory workers,
who earned wages that were about two-thirds of those of
highly skilled workers. At the bottom of the urban
working class were the unskilled laborers. They were the
largest group of workers and included day laborers and
large numbers of domestic servants. One out of every
seven employed persons in Great Britain in 1900 was a
domestic servant. Most of these were women.
Urban workers did experience a real betterment in
the material conditions of their lives after 1871. For one
thing, urban improvements meant better living conditions. A rise in real wages, accompanied by a decline in
many consumer costs, especially in the 1880s and 1890s,
made it possible for workers to afford more than just food
and housing. Workers’ budgets now provided money for
more clothes and even leisure at the same time that strikes
and labor agitation were providing shorter (ten-hour)
workdays and Saturday afternoons off.
The ‘‘Woman Question’’: The Role of Women
The ‘‘woman question’’ was the term used to identify the
debate over the role of women in society. In the nineteenth century, women remained legally inferior, economically dependent, and largely defined by family and
household roles. Many women still aspired to the ideal of
femininity popularized by writers and poets. Alfred Lord
Tennyson’s poem The Princess expressed it well:
Man for the field and woman for the hearth:
Man for the sword and for the needle she:
Man with the head and woman with the heart:
Man to command and woman to obey;
All else confusion.
This traditional characterization of the sexes, based on
gender-defined social roles, was elevated to the status of
universal male and female attributes in the nineteenth
century, due largely to the impact of the Industrial
Revolution on the family. As the chief family wage
earners, men worked outside the home while women
were left with the care of the family, for which they were
paid nothing. Of course, the ideal did not always match
reality, especially for the lower classes, where the need
for supplemental income drove women to do ‘‘sweated’’
work.
Throughout most of the nineteenth century, marriage was viewed as the only honorable and available
career for most women. While the middle classes glorified the ideal of domesticity (see the box on p. 496),
for most women marriage was a matter of economic
necessity. The lack of meaningful work and the lower
wages paid to women made it difficult for single women
to earn a living. Most women chose to marry, which was
reflected in the increase in marriage rates and a decline
in illegitimacy rates in the course of the nineteenth
century.
Birthrates also dropped significantly at this time. A
very important factor in the evolution of the modern
family was the decline in the number of offspring born to
the average woman. The change was not necessarily due
to new technological products. Although the invention of
vulcanized rubber in the 1840s made possible the production of condoms and diaphragms, they were not
widely used as contraceptive devices until the era of
World War I. Some historians maintain that the change in
attitude that led parents to deliberately limit the number
of offspring was more important than the method used.
While some historians attribute increased birth control to
more widespread use of coitus interruptus, or male
withdrawal before ejaculation, others have emphasized
the ability of women to restrict family size through
abortion and even infanticide or abandonment. That a
change in attitude occurred was apparent in the emergence of a movement to increase awareness of birth control methods. Europe’s first birth control clinic, founded
by Dr. Aletta Jacob, opened in Amsterdam in 1882.
The Middle-Class Family The family was the central
institution of middle-class life. Men provided the family
income, while women focused on household and child
care. The use of domestic servants in many middle-class
homes, made possible by an abundant supply of cheap
labor, reduced the amount of time middle-class women
had to spend on household chores. At the same time, by
reducing the number of children in the family, mothers
could devote more time to child care and domestic
leisure.
The middle-class family fostered an ideal of togetherness. The Victorians codified the family Christmas,
with its yule log, Christmas tree, songs, and exchange of
gifts. In the United States, Fourth of July celebrations
changed from drunken revels to family picnics by the
1850s. The education of middle-class females in domestic crafts, singing, and piano playing prepared them
for their function of providing a proper environment for
home recreation.
The Working-Class Family Women in working-class
families were more accustomed to hard work. Daughters
in working-class families were expected to work until they
married; even after marriage, they often did piecework at
home to support the family. For the children of the
working class, childhood was over by the age of nine or
ten when they became apprentices or were employed in
odd jobs.
Between 1890 and 1914, however, family patterns
among the working class began to change. High-paying
jobs in heavy industry and improvements in the standard
of living made it possible for working-class families to
depend on the income of husbands and the wages of
grown children. By the early twentieth century, some
working-class mothers could afford to stay at home,
following the pattern of middle-class women. At the same
time, new consumer products, such as sewing machines,
clocks, bicycles, and cast-iron stoves, created a new mass
consumer society whose focus was on higher levels of
consumption.
These working-class families also followed the middle
classes in limiting the size of their families. Children began to be viewed as dependents rather than wage earners
as child labor laws and compulsory education took children out of the workforce and into schools. Improvements in public health as well as advances in medicine
and a better diet resulted in a decline in infant mortality
rates for the lower classes and made it easier for workingclass families to choose to have fewer children. At the
same time, strikes and labor agitation led to laws that
reduced work hours to ten per day by 1900 and eliminated work on Saturday afternoons, which enabled
working-class parents to devote more attention to their
children and develop deeper emotional ties with them.
Education in the Mass Society
Mass education was a product of the mass society of the
late nineteenth century. Being ‘‘educated’’ in the early
nineteenth century meant attending a secondary school or
possibly even a university. Secondary schools mostly emphasized a classical education based on the study of Greek
and Latin. Secondary and university education was primarily for the elite, the sons of government officials, nobles,
or the wealthier members of the middle classes. After 1850,
secondary education was expanded as more middle-class
families sought employment in public service and the professions or entry into elite scientific and technical schools.
Universal Elementary Education In the decades after
1870, the functions of the state were extended to include
the development of mass education in state-run systems.
Between 1870 and 1914, most Western governments began to offer at least primary education to both boys and
girls between the ages of six and twelve. States also
assumed responsibility for the quality of teachers by
establishing teacher-training schools. By 1900, many
European states, especially in northern and western
Europe, were providing state-financed primary schools,
salaried and trained teachers, and free, compulsory mass
elementary education.
Why did European states make this commitment to
mass education? Liberals believed that education was
important to personal and social improvement and sought
in Catholic countries to supplant Catholic education with
moral and civic training based on secular values. Even
conservatives were attracted to mass education as a means
of improving the quality of military recruits and training
people in social discipline. In 1875, a German military
journal stated, ‘‘We in Germany consider education to be
one of the principal ways of promoting the strength of the
nation and above all military strength.’’3
Another incentive for mass education came from
industrialization. In the early Industrial Revolution, unskilled labor was sufficient to meet factory needs, but the
new firms of the Second Industrial Revolution demanded
skilled labor. Both boys and girls with an elementary education had new possibilities of jobs beyond their villages
or small towns, including white-collar jobs in railway and
subway stations, post offices, banking and shipping firms,
teaching, and nursing. To industrialists, then, mass education furnished the trained workers they needed.
Nevertheless, the chief motive for mass education was
political. The expansion of voting rights necessitated
a more educated electorate. Even more important, mass
compulsory education instilled patriotism and nationalized the masses,
providing an opportunity for even
greater national integration. As people lost their ties to local regions and
even to religion, nationalism supplied a new faith. The use of a single
common language created greater
national unity than loyalty to a ruler
ever did.
A nation’s motives for universal
elementary education largely determined what was taught in the
schools. Obviously, indoctrination
in national values took on great
importance. At the core of the
academic curriculum were reading,
writing, arithmetic, national history
(especially geared to a patriotic
view), geography, literature, and
some singing and drawing. The education of boys and girls varied,
however. Where possible, the sexes
were separated. Girls did less math
and no science but concentrated on
such domestic skills as sewing, washing, ironing, and
cooking, all prerequisites for providing a good home for
husband and children. Boys were taught some practical
skills, such as carpentry, and even some military drill. Most
of the elementary schools also inculcated the middle-class
virtues of hard work, thrift, sobriety, cleanliness, and respect for the family. For most students, elementary education led to apprenticeship and a job.
Female Teachers The development of compulsory
elementary education created a demand for teachers, and
most of them were female. In the United States, for example, females constituted two-thirds of all teachers by the
1880s. Many men viewed the teaching of children as an
extension of women’s ‘‘natural role’’ as nurturers of children. Moreover, females were paid lower salaries, in itself a
considerable incentive for governments to encourage the
establishment of teacher-training institutes for women.
The first colleges for women were teacher-training schools;
not until the beginning of the twentieth century were
women permitted to enter the male-dominated universities. In France, 3 percent of university students in 1902
were women; by 1914, their number had increased to
10 percent of the total.
Literacy and the Mass Newspaper The most immediate result of mass education was an increase in literacy.
In Germany, Great Britain, France, and the Scandinavian
countries, adult illiteracy was virtually eliminated by 1900.
Where there was less schooling, the story is very different.
Adult illiteracy rates were 79 percent in Serbia, 78 percent
in Romania, and 79 percent in Russia. All of these
countries had made only a minimal investment in mass
education.
With the dramatic increase in literacy after 1871 came
the rise of mass newspapers, such as the Evening News
(1881) and Daily Mail (1896) in London, which sold
millions of copies a day. These newspapers were written in
an easily understood style and tended to be extremely
sensational. Unlike eighteenth-century newspapers, which
were full of serious editorials and lengthy political analysis,
these tabloids provided lurid details of crimes, jingoistic
diatribes, gossip, and sports news. There were other forms
of cheap literature as well. Specialty magazines, such as the
Family Herald for the entire family, and women’s magazines began to appear in the 1860s. Pulp fiction for adults
included the extremely popular westerns with their innumerable variations on conflicts between cowboys and
Indians. Literature for the masses was but one feature of
the new mass culture; another was the emergence of new
forms of mass leisure.
Mass Leisure
In the preindustrial centuries, play or leisure activities had
been closely connected to work patterns based on the
seasonal or daily cycles typical of the life of peasants and
artisans. The process of industrialization in the nineteenth century had an enormous impact on that traditional pattern. The factory imposed new work patterns
that were determined by the rhythms of machines and
clocks and removed work time completely from the
family environment of farms and workshops. Work and
leisure became opposites as leisure came to be defined as
what people did for fun when they were not at work. In
fact, the new leisure hours created by the industrial
system---evening hours after work, weekends, and later a
week or two in the summer---largely determined the
contours of the new mass leisure.
New technology also determined mass leisure pursuits. The new technology created novel experiences for
leisure, such as the Ferris wheel at amusement parks, and
the mechanized urban transportation systems of the
1880s meant that even the working classes were no longer
dependent on neighborhood bars but could make their
way to athletic games, amusement parks, and dance halls.
Railroads could take people to the beaches on weekends.
The upper and middle classes had created the first
market for tourism, but as wages increased and workers
were given paid vacations, tourism became another form
of mass leisure. Thomas Cook (1808--1892) was a British
pioneer of mass tourism. Secretary to a British temperance
group, Cook had been responsible for organizing a railroad
trip to temperance gatherings in 1841. This experience led
him to offer trips on a regular basis after he found that he
could make substantial profits by renting special trains,
lowering prices, and increasing the number of passengers.
By the late nineteenth century, team sports had also
developed into yet another focus of mass leisure. Unlike
the old rural games, however, they were no longer chaotic
and spontaneous activities but became strictly organized
with formal rules and officials to enforce them. These
rules were the products of organized athletic groups,
such as the English Football Association (1863) and the
American Bowling Congress (1895).
The new team sports rapidly became professionalized. In Britain, soccer had its Football Association in
1863 and rugby its Rugby Football Union in 1871. In the
United States, the first national association to recognize
professional baseball players was formed in 1863. By
1900, the National League and American League had a
complete monopoly over professional baseball. The development of urban transportation systems made possible
the construction of stadiums where thousands could attend, making mass spectator sports a big business.
Standardized forms of amusement drew mass audiences. Although some theorists argued that the new amusements were important for improving people, they served
primarily to provide entertainment and distract people
from the realities of their work lives. The new mass leisure
also represented a significant change from earlier forms
of popular culture. Festivals and fairs had been based on
active and spontaneous community participation, whereas
the new forms of mass leisure were businesses, standardized
for largely passive mass audiences and organized to make
profits.
The National State
Q Focus Question: What general political trends were
evident in the nations of western Europe in the last
decades of the nineteenth century, and how did these
trends differ from the policies pursued in Germany,
Austria-Hungary, and Russia?
Within the major European states, considerable progress
was made in achieving such liberal practices as constitutions and parliaments, but it was largely in western
Europe that mass politics became a reality. Reforms encouraged the expansion of political democracy through
voting rights for men and the creation of mass political
parties. At the same time, however, these latter developments were strongly resisted in parts of Europe where the
old political forces remained strong.
Western Europe: The Growth
of Political Democracy
In general, parliamentary government was most firmly
rooted in the western European states. Both Britain and
France saw an expansion of the right to vote, but liberal
reforms proved less successful in Italy.
Reform in Britain By 1871, Great Britain had a functioning two-party parliamentary system, and the growth
of political democracy became one of the preoccupations
of British politics. Its cause was pushed along by the expansion of suffrage. Much advanced by the Reform Act of
1867 (see Chapter 22), the right to vote was further extended during the second ministry of William Gladstone
(1880--1885) with the passage of the Reform Act of 1884.
It gave the vote to all men who paid regular rents or taxes,
thus largely enfranchising agricultural workers, a group
previously excluded (see Table 22.1 on p. 475). The following year, the Redistribution Act eliminated traditional
boroughs and counties and established constituencies with
approximately equal populations and one representative
each. The payment of salaries to members of the House of
Commons beginning in 1911 further democratized that
institution by opening the door to people other than the
wealthy. Gradual reform through parliamentary institutions had become the way of British political life.
The Third Republic in France The defeat of France by
the Prussian army in 1870 brought the downfall of Louis
Napoleon’s Second Empire. In new elections based on
universal male suffrage, the French people rejected the
republicans and overwhelmingly favored the monarchists,
who won two-thirds of the seats in the new National
Assembly. In response, on March 26, 1871, radical republicans formed an independent republican government
in Paris known as the Commune.
But the National Assembly refused to give up its
power and decided to crush the renegade Commune.
Vicious fighting broke out in April. Many working-class
men and women stepped forth to defend the Commune.
At first, women’s activities were the traditional ones:
caring for the wounded soldiers and feeding the troops.
Gradually, however, women expanded their activities to
include taking care of weapons, working as scouts, and
even setting up their own fighting brigades. Louise Michel
(1830--1905), a schoolteacher, emerged as one of the
leaders of the Paris Commune (see the box on p. 502).
She proved tireless in forming committees for the defense
of the Commune.
All of these efforts were in vain, however. In the last
week of May, government troops massacred thousands of
the Commune’s defenders. Estimates are that twenty
thousand were shot; another ten thousand (including
Louise Michel) were shipped to the French penal colony of
New Caledonia, in the South Pacific. The brutal repression
of the Commune bequeathed a legacy of hatred that
continued to plague French politics for decades. The harsh
punishment of women who participated in antigovernment activities also served to discourage any future action
by working-class women to improve their conditions.
Although a majority of the members of the monarchistdominated National Assembly wished to restore a monarchy in France, inability to agree on who should be king
caused the monarchists to miss their opportunity and led
in 1875 to an improvised constitution that established a
republican form of government as the least divisive
compromise. This constitution established a bicameral
legislature with an upper house, the Senate, elected indirectly and a lower house, the Chamber of Deputies,
chosen by universal male suffrage; a president, selected
by the legislature for a term of seven years, served as executive of the government. The Constitution of 1875, intended only as a stopgap measure, solidified the republic---
the Third Republic---which lasted sixty-five years. New
elections in 1876 and 1877 strengthened the hands of the
republicans, who managed by 1879 to institute ministerial
responsibility and establish the power of the Chamber of
Deputies. The prime minister or premier and his ministers
were now responsible not to the president but to the
Chamber of Deputies.
Italy By 1870, Italy had emerged as a geographically
united state with pretensions to great power status. Its
internal weaknesses, however, gave that claim a particularly hollow ring. One Italian leader said after unification,
‘‘We have made Italy; now we must make Italians.’’ But
many Italians continued to put loyalty to their families,
towns, and regions above their loyalty to the new state.
Sectional differences---a poverty-stricken south and
an industrializing north---also weakened any sense of
unity, and most of the Italian leaders were northerners
who treated southern Italians with contempt. The Catholic church, which had lost control of the Papal States as a
result of unification, even refused to accept the existence
of the new state. Chronic turmoil between workers and
industrialists undermined the social fabric. And few
Italians felt empowered in the new Italy: only 2.5 percent
of the people could vote for the legislative body. In 1882,
the number was increased, but only to 10 percent. The
Italian government was unable to deal effectively with
these problems because of extensive corruption among
government officials and a lack of stability resulting from
ever-changing government coalitions. The granting of
universal male suffrage in 1912 did little to correct the
corruption and weak government. Even the Italians’
pretensions to great power status came up empty when
Italy became the first modern European nation to be
defeated in battle by an African state, Ethiopia.
Central and Eastern Europe: Persistence
of the Old Order
Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Russia pursued political
policies that were quite different from those of the western
European nations. Germany and Austria-Hungary had the
trappings of parliamentary government, including legislative bodies and elections by universal male suffrage, but
authoritarian forces, especially powerful monarchies and
conservative social groups, remained strong. In eastern
Europe, especially Russia, the old system of autocracy was
barely touched by the winds of change.
Germany The constitution of the new imperial Germany
begun by Bismarck in 1871 provided for a federal system
with a bicameral legislature. The lower house of the German parliament, the Reichstag, was elected on the basis
of universal male suffrage, but it did not have ministerial responsibility. Ministers of government, the most
important of which was the chancellor, were responsible
not to the parliament but to the emperor. The emperor
also commanded the armed forces and controlled foreign
policy and internal administration. Although the creation
of a parliament elected by universal male suffrage presented
opportunities for the growth of a real political democracy,
it failed to develop in Germany before World War I. The
army and Bismarck were two major reasons why it did not.
The German (largely Prussian) army viewed itself as
the defender of monarchy and aristocracy and sought to
escape control by the Reichstag by operating under a
general staff responsible only to the emperor. Prussian
military tradition was strong, and military officers took
steps to ensure the loyalty of their subordinates to the
emperor.
The policies of Bismarck, who served as chancellor of
the new German state until 1890, often prevented the
growth of more democratic institutions. At first, Bismarck worked with the liberals, especially in launching an
attack on the Catholic church, the so-called Kulturkampf
or ‘‘struggle for civilization.’’ Like Bismarck, middle-class
liberals distrusted Catholics’ loyalty to the new Germany.
But Bismarck’s tactics proved counterproductive, and
Bismarck soon abandoned the attack on Catholicism by
making an abrupt shift in policy.
In 1878, Bismarck abandoned the liberals and,
alarmed by the growth of the Social Democratic Party,
began to go after the socialists. He genuinely believed that
the socialists’ antinationalistic, anticapitalistic, and antimonarchical stance represented a danger to the empire. So
Bismarck got the parliament to pass a law that limited
socialist meetings and publications while still allowing
socialist candidates to run for the Reichstag. Bismarck also
attempted to woo workers away from socialism by enacting social welfare legislation. Between 1883 and 1889,
the Reichstag passed laws that provided sickness, accident,
and disability benefits as well as old-age pensions, financed by compulsory contributions from workers, employers, and the state. Bismarck’s social security system
was the most progressive the world had yet seen. Nevertheless, both the repressive and the social welfare measures
failed to stop the growth of socialism. In his frustration,
Bismarck planned still more antisocialist measures in
1890, but before he could carry them out, the new emperor, William II (1888--1918), eager to pursue his own
policies, sent the aged chancellor packing.
Austria-Hungary After the creation of the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary in 1867, the Austrian part received
a constitution that established a parliamentary system with
the principle of ministerial responsibility. But Emperor
Francis Joseph (1848--1916) largely ignored ministerial responsibility and proceeded to personally appoint and dismiss his ministers and rule by decree when parliament was
not in session.
The problem of the minorities continued to trouble
the empire. The ethnic Germans, who made up only onethird of Austria’s population, governed Austria but felt
increasingly threatened by the Czechs, Poles, and other
Slavic groups within the empire.
What held the Austro-Hungarian Empire together was a
combination of forces. Francis Joseph, the emperor, was
one unifying factor. Although strongly anti-Hungarian, the
cautious emperor made an effort to take a position above
national differences. Loyalty to the Catholic church also
helped maintain support of the Catholic Habsburg dynasty
among such national groups as Czechs, Slovaks, and Poles.
Finally, although dominated by German-speaking officials,
the large imperial bureaucracy served as a unifying force for
the empire.
Russia In Russia, the government made no concession
whatever to liberal and democratic reforms, eliminating
altogether any possibility of a mass politics. The assassination of Alexander II in 1881 convinced his son and
successor, Alexander III (1881--1894), that reform had
been a mistake, and he quickly instituted what he said
were ‘‘exceptional measures.’’ The powers of the secret
police were expanded. Advocates of constitutional monarchy and social reform, along with revolutionary groups,
were persecuted. Entire districts of Russia were placed
under martial law if the government suspected the inhabitants of treason. The powers of the zemstvos, created
by the reforms of Alexander II, were sharply curtailed.
Alexander also pursued a radical Russification
program among the numerous nationalities that made
up the Russian Empire. Russians themselves constituted
only 40 percent of the population, which did not stop
the tsar from banning the use of all languages except
Russian in schools. The Russification policy angered
national groups and created new sources of opposition
to tsarist policies.
When Alexander III died, his weak son and successor,
Nicholas II (1894--1917), began his rule with his father’s
conviction that the absolute power of the tsars should be
preserved: ‘‘I shall maintain the principle of autocracy just
as firmly and unflinchingly as did my unforgettable father.’’4 But conditions were changing, especially with the
spread of industrialization, and the tsar’s approach was
not realistic in view of the new circumstances he faced.

CONCLUSION
The Second Industrial Revolution helped create a material
prosperity that led Europeans to believe they had ushered in a
new ‘‘age of progress.’’ A major feature of this age was the
emergence of a mass society. The lower classes in particular
benefited from the right to vote, a higher standard of living, and
new schools that provided them with an education. New forms of
mass transportation, combined with new work patterns, enabled
large numbers of people to enjoy weekend excursions to
amusement parks and seaside resorts and to participate in new
mass leisure activities.
By 1871, the national state had become the focus of people’s
lives. Liberal and democratic reforms brought new possibilities for
greater participation in the political process, although women were
still largely excluded from political rights. After 1871, the national
state also began to expand its functions beyond all previous limits.
Fearful of the growth of socialism and trade unions, governments
attempted to appease the working masses by adopting such social
insurance measures as protection against accidents, illness, and old
age. These social welfare measures were narrow in scope and limited
in benefits, but they signaled a new direction for state action to
benefit the mass of its citizens. The enactment of public health and
housing measures, designed to curb the worst ills of urban living,
was yet another indication of how state power could be used to
benefit the people.
This extension of state functions took place in an atmosphere
of increased national loyalty. After 1871, Western nation-states
increasingly sought to solidify the social order and win the active
loyalty and support of their citizens by deliberately cultivating
national feelings. Yet this policy contained potentially great dangers.
As we shall see in the next chapter, nations had discovered once
again that imperialistic adventures and military successes could
arouse nationalistic passions and smother domestic political unrest.
But they also found that nationalistic feelings could lead to intense
international rivalries that made war almost inevitable.
