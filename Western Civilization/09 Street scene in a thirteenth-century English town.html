<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbe89a44">
<p class="verse">
The new European civilization that had emerged in the ninth and tenth centuries<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;began to come into its own in the eleventh and twelfth centuries<br />
&#xa0;as Europeans established new patterns that reached their zenith in the thirteenth century.<br />
The High Middle Ages (1000&#x2013;1300) was a period of recovery and growth for Western civilization,<br />
&#xa0;characterized by a greater sense of security and a burst of energy and enthusiasm.<br />
New agricultural practices that increased the food supply<br />
&#xa0;helped spur a commercial and urban revival that,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;accompanied by a rising population,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;gave a new dynamism to a formerly static society.<br />
<br />
Townspeople themselves were often great enthusiasts for their new way of life.<br />
In the twelfth century,<br />
&#xa0;William Fitz-Stephen spoke of London as one of the noble cities of the world:<br />
&#xa0;'It is happy in the healthiness of its air, in the Christian religion,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;in the strength of its defences,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;the nature of its site, the honor of its citizens, the modesty of its women;<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;pleasant in sports; fruitful of noble men.'<br />
To Fitz-Stephen, London offered myriad opportunities and pleasures.<br />
Fairs and markets were held regularly,<br />
&#xa0;and 'practically anything that man may need<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;is brought daily not only into special places but even into the open squares.'<br />
Any man, according to Fitz-Stephen,<br />
&#xa0;'if he is healthy and not a good-for-nothing,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;may earn his living expenses and esteem according to his station.'<br />
Then, too, there are the happy inhabitants of the city:<br />
&#xa0;Where else has one 'ever met such a wonderful show of people<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;this side or the other side of the sea'?<br />
Sporting events and leisure activities are available in every season of the year:<br />
&#xa0;'In Easter holidays they fight battles on water.'<br />
In summer, 'the youths are exercised in leaping, dancing, shooting, wrestling, casting the stone;<br />
&#xa0;the maidens dance as long as they can well see.'<br />
In winter, 'when the great fen, or moor,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;which waters the walls of the city on the north side,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;is frozen,<br />
&#xa0;many young men play upon the ice;<br />
&#xa0;some, striding as wide as they may, do slide swiftly.'<br />
To Fitz-Stephen, 'every convenience for human pleasure is known to be at hand' in London.<br />
One would hardly know from his cheerful description<br />
&#xa0;that medieval cities faced overcrowded conditions,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;terrible smells from rotting garbage and raw sewage,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and the constant challenge of epidemics and fires.<br />
<br />
By the twelfth and thirteenth centuries,<br />
&#xa0;both the urban centers and the urban population of Europe were experiencing a dramatic expansion.<br />
New forms of cultural and intellectual expression also arose in this new urban world.<br />
Although European society in the High Middle Ages remained overwhelmingly agricultural,<br />
&#xa0;the growth of trade and cities<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;along with the development of a money economy and new commercial practices and institutions<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;constituted a veritable commercial revolution that affected most of Europe.<br />

The High Middle Age (1000-1300) was a period of recovery and growth for Western civilization,<br />
	characterized by a commercial and urban revival accompanied by a rising population<br />
		which was spurred by the surplus of the food supply.<br />
Townspeople were often great enthusiasts for their new way of life.<br />
According to Fit-Stephen's descriptions, London offered myriad opportunities and pleasure,<br />
	sporting events and leisure activities available in every season of the year.<br />
	fairs and markets which were held regularly,<br />
	and life expenses and esteem which were afforded as long as you were not a good-for-nothing.<br />
However, medieval cities also faced overcrowded conditions,<br />
	terrible smells, and the challenges of epidemics and fires.<br />
Although European society remained overwhelmingly agricultural,<br />
	the development of trade and cities<br />
		accompanied the growth of a money economy and new commercial practices and institutions<br />
	composed a veritable revolution that affected most of Europe.<br />
