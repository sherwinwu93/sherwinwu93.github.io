HISTORIANS OFTEN DEFINE the eighteenth century as the
years from 1715 to 1789. Politically, this makes sense, because 1715
marks the end of the age of Louis XIV and 1789 was the year in
which the French Revolution erupted. This period has often been
portrayed as the final phase of Europe’s old order, swept away by
the violent upheaval and reordering of society associated with the
French Revolution. Europe’s old order, still largely agrarian, dominated by kings and landed aristocrats, and grounded in privileges
for nobles, clergy, towns, and provinces, seemed to continue a basic
pattern that had prevailed in Europe since medieval times. But new
ideas and practices were beginning to emerge. Just as a new intellectual order based on rationalism and secularism was evolving from
the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment, demographic, economic, and social patterns were beginning to change in ways that
heralded the emergence of a modern new order.
The ideas of the Enlightenment seemed to proclaim a new political age as well. Catherine the Great, who ruled Russia from 1762
to 1796, wrote to Voltaire: ‘‘Since 1746 I have been under the greatest obligations to you. Before that period I read nothing but romances, but by chance your works fell into my hands, and ever since
then I have never ceased to read them, and have no desire for books
less well written than yours, or less instructive.’’ The empress also
invited Diderot to Russia and, when he arrived, urged him to speak
frankly ‘‘as man to man.’’ Diderot did, offering her advice for a farranging program of political and financial reform. But Catherine’s
apparent eagerness to make enlightened reforms was tempered by
skepticism. She said of Diderot, ‘‘If I had believed him, everything
would have been turned upside down in my kingdom; legislation,
administration, finance---all would have been turned topsy-turvy to
make room for impractical theories.’’ For Catherine, enlightened reform remained more a dream than a reality, and in the end, the
waging of wars to gain more power was more important.

In the eighteenth century, the process of centralization that
had characterized the growth of states since the Middle Ages continued as most European states enlarged their bureaucratic machinery
and consolidated their governments in order to collect the revenues
and build the armies they needed to compete militarily with the
other European states. International competition continued to be
the favorite pastime of eighteenth-century rulers. Within the European state system, the nations that would dominate Europe until
World War I---Britain, France, Austria, Prussia, and Russia---emerged
as the five great powers of Europe. Their rivalries led to major
wars. In the midst of this state building and warmaking, dramatic
demographic, economic, and social changes gave rise to a radical
transformation in the way Europeans would raise food and produce
goods.

The European States
Q Focus Questions: What were the main developments
in France and Great Britain in the eighteenth century?
What do historians mean by the term enlightened
absolutism, and to what degree did eighteenth-century
Prussia, Austria, and Russia exhibit its characteristics?
Most European states in the eighteenth century were ruled
by monarchs. Although the seventeenth-century justification for strong monarchy on the basis of divine right
continued into the succeeding century, as the eighteenth
century became increasingly secularized, divine-right assumptions were gradually superseded by influential utilitarian arguments. The Prussian king Frederick II expressed
these well when he attempted to explain the services a
monarch must provide for his people:
These services consisted in the maintenance of the laws; a
strict execution of justice; an employment of his whole
powers to prevent any corruption of manners; and defending
the state against its enemies. It is the duty of this magistrate
to pay attention to agriculture; it should be his care that
provisions for the nation should be in abundance, and that
commerce and industry should be encouraged. He is a perpetual sentinel, who must watch the acts and the conduct of
the enemies of the state. . . . If he be the first general, the
first minister of the realm, it is not that he should remain
the shadow of authority, but that he should fulfill the duties
of such titles. He is only the first servant of the state.1
This utilitarian argument was reinforced by the praises of
the philosophes.
Enlightened Absolutism?
There is no doubt that Enlightenment thought had an
impact on the political development of European states in
the eighteenth century. Closely related to the Enlightenment idea of natural laws was the belief in natural rights,
which were thought to be fundamental privileges that
must not be withheld from any person. These natural
rights included equality before the law, freedom of religious worship, freedom of speech and the press, and the
rights to assemble, hold property, and seek happiness.
The United States’ Declaration of Independence in 1776
summarized the Enlightenment concept of natural rights
in its opening paragraph: ‘‘We hold these truths to be selfevident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights,
that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of
Happiness.’’
But how were these natural rights to be established
and preserved? In the opinion of most philosophes,
people needed the direction provided by an enlightened
ruler. What made rulers enlightened? They must allow
religious toleration, freedom of speech and the press, and
the rights of private property. They must foster the arts,
sciences, and education. Above all, they must not be arbitrary in their rule; they must obey the laws and enforce
them fairly for all subjects. Only strong monarchs seemed
capable of overcoming vested interests and effecting the
reforms society needed. Reforms, then, should come from
above---from the rulers rather than from the people.
Distrustful of the masses, the philosophes believed that
absolute rulers, swayed by enlightened principles, were
the best hope of reforming their societies.
The extent to which rulers actually did so is frequently discussed in the political history of Europe in the
eighteenth century. Many historians once assumed that a
new type of monarchy emerged in the late eighteenth
century, which they called enlightened despotism or
enlightened absolutism. Monarchs such as Frederick II
of Prussia, Catherine the Great of Russia, and Joseph II of
Austria supposedly followed the advice of the philosophes
and ruled by enlightened principles, establishing a path to
modern nationhood. Recent scholarship, however, has
questioned the usefulness of the concept of enlightened
absolutism. We can best determine the extent to which it
can be applied by surveying the development of the European states and then making a judgment about the
enlightened absolutism of the late eighteenth century.
The Atlantic Seaboard States
As a result of overseas voyages in the sixteenth century,
the European economic axis began to shift from the
Mediterranean to the Atlantic seaboard. In the seventeenth century, English and Dutch influence expanded as
that of Spain and Portugal declined. By the eighteenth
century, Dutch power had waned, and it fell to the English and the French to build the commercial empires that
ultimately fostered a truly global economy.
France: The Problems of the French Monarchy In the
eighteenth century, France experienced an economic revival as the Enlightenment gained strength. The French
monarchy, however, was not overly influenced by the
philosophes and resisted reforms even as the French aristocracy grew stronger.
Louis XIV had left France with enlarged territories, an
enormous debt, an unhappy populace, and a five-year-old
great-grandson as his successor. Louis XV (1715--1774)
did not begin to rule in his own right until 1743. But
Louis was both lazy and weak, and ministers and mistresses
soon began to influence the king, control the affairs of state,
and undermine the prestige of the monarchy. The loss of an
empire in the Seven Years’ War (discussed later in this
chapter), accompanied by burdensome taxes, an ever-mounting
public debt, more hungry people,
and a frivolous court life at Versailles, forced even Louis to recognize the growing disgust with his
monarchy.
The next king, Louis’s twentyyear-old grandson, who became
Louis XVI (1774--1792), knew
little about the operations of the
French government and lacked
the energy to deal decisively with
state affairs. His wife, Marie Antoinette, was a spoiled Austrian
princess who devoted much of her
time to court intrigues (see ‘‘Film
& History: Marie Antoinette’’).
As France’s financial crises worsened, neither Louis nor his queen
seemed able to fathom the depths
of despair and discontent that
soon led to violent revolution (see
Chapter 19).
Great Britain: King and Parliament The success of the
Glorious Revolution in England had prevented absolutism without clearly inaugurating constitutional monarchy. The eighteenth-century British political system was
characterized by a sharing of power between king and
Parliament, with Parliament gradually gaining the upper
hand. (The United Kingdom of Great Britain came into
existence in 1707 when the governments of England and
Scotland were united; the term British came to refer to
both English and Scots.) The king chose ministers responsible to himself who set policy and guided Parliament; Parliament had the power to make laws, levy taxes,
pass the budget, and indirectly influence the king’s ministers. The eighteenth-century British Parliament was
dominated by a landed aristocracy that historians usually
divide into two groups: the peers, who sat for life in
the House of Lords, and the landed gentry, who sat in the
House of Commons and served as justices of the peace.
The two groups had much in common: both were made
up of landowners with similar economic interests, and
they frequently intermarried.
The deputies to the House of Commons were chosen
from the boroughs and counties but not by popular
voting. Who was eligible to vote in the boroughs varied
widely, enabling wealthy landed aristocrats to gain support by patronage and bribery; the result was a number
of ‘‘pocket boroughs’’ controlled by a single person (hence
‘‘in his pocket’’). The duke of Newcastle, for example,
controlled the representatives from seven boroughs. It has
been estimated that out of 405 borough deputies, 293
were chosen by fewer than 500 voters. This aristocratic
control also extended to the county delegates, two from
each of England’s forty counties. Although all holders of
property worth at least 40 shillings a year could vote,
members of the leading landed gentry families were
elected over and over again.
In 1714, a new dynasty---the Hanoverians---was established. When the last Stuart ruler, Queen Anne, died
without an heir, the crown was offered to the Protestant
rulers of the German state of Hanover. Because the first
Hanoverian king, George I (1714--1727), did not speak
English and neither he nor George II (1727--1760) had
much familiarity with the British system, their chief
ministers were allowed to handle Parliament. Many historians believe that this exercise of ministerial power was
an important step in the development of the modern
cabinet system in British government.
Robert Walpole served as prime minister from 1721
to 1742 and pursued a peaceful foreign policy to avoid
new land taxes. But new forces were emerging in eighteenthcentury England as growing trade and industry led an
ever-increasing middle class to favor expansion of trade
and world empire. The exponents of empire found a
spokesperson in William Pitt the Elder, who became
prime minister in 1757 and furthered imperial ambitions
by acquiring Canada and India in the Seven Years’ War.
Despite his successes, however, Pitt the Elder was
dismissed in 1761 by the new king, George III (1760--
1820), and replaced by the king’s favorite, Lord Bute.
However, discontent over the electoral system and the loss
of the American colonies (see Chapter 19) brought public
criticism of the king. In 1780, the House of Commons
affirmed that ‘‘the influence of the crown has increased, is
increasing, and ought to be diminished.’’ King George III
managed to avoid drastic change by appointing William
Pitt the Younger (1759--1806), son of William Pitt the
Elder, as prime minister in 1783. Supported by the
merchants, industrial classes, and the king, Pitt managed
to stay in power. George III, however, remained an uncertain supporter because of periodic bouts of insanity
(he once mistook a tree in Windsor Park for the king
of Prussia). Thanks to Pitt’s successes, however, serious
reform of the corrupt parliamentary system was avoided
for another generation.
Absolutism in Central and Eastern Europe
Of the five major European powers, three were located in
central and eastern Europe and came to play an increasingly important role in European international politics
(see Map 18.1).
Prussia: Army and Bureaucracy Two able Prussian
kings in the eighteenth century, Frederick William I and
Frederick II the Great, further developed the two major
institutions---the army and the bureaucracy---that were the
backbone of Prussia. Frederick William I (1713--1740)
promoted the evolution of Prussia’s highly efficient civil
bureaucracy by establishing the General Directory. It
served as the chief administrative agent of the central
government, supervising military, police, economic, and
financial affairs. Frederick William strove to maintain a
highly efficient bureaucracy of civil service workers. It had
its own code in which obedience, honor, and service to
the king were the highest duty. As Frederick William asserted, ‘‘One must serve the king with life and limb, with
goods and chattels, with honor and conscience, and
surrender everything except salvation. The latter is reserved for God. But everything else must be mine.’’2 Close
personal supervision of the bureaucracy became a hallmark of the eighteenth-century Prussian rulers.
Frederick William’s other major concern was the army.
By the end of his reign, it had grown from 45,000 to
83,000 men. Though the tenth-largest nation in physical
size and thirteenth in population in Europe, Prussia had
the fourth-largest army, after France, Russia, and Austria.
The nobility or landed aristocracy known as Junkers, who
owned large estates with many serfs, were the officers in
the Prussian army. They too had a strong sense of service
to the king or state. Prussian nobles believed in duty,
obedience, and sacrifice. At the same time, because of its
size and its reputation as one of the finest in Europe, the
Prussian army was the most important institution in the
state.
Frederick the Great (1740--1786) was one of the besteducated and most cultured monarchs in the eighteenth
century. He was well versed in Enlightenment thought
and even invited Voltaire to live at his court for several
years. His intellectual interests were despised by his father,
who forced his intelligent son to prepare for a career in
rulership. A believer in the king as the ‘‘first servant of the
state,’’ Frederick became a conscientious ruler who made few
innovations in administration. His diligence in overseeing
its operation, however, made the Prussian bureaucracy well
known for both efficiency and honesty.
For a time, Frederick seemed quite willing to follow
the philosophes’ suggestions for reform. He established a
single code of laws for his territories that eliminated the
use of torture except in treason and murder cases. He also
granted a limited freedom of speech and the press as well
as complete religious toleration---no difficult task since he
had no strong religious convictions anyway. Although
Frederick was well aware of the philosophes’ condemnation of serfdom, he was too dependent on the Prussian
nobility to interfere with it or with the hierarchical
structure of Prussian society. In fact, Frederick was a
social conservative who made Prussian society even more
aristocratic than it had been before. Frederick reversed his
father’s policy of allowing commoners to have power in
the civil service and reserved the higher positions in the
bureaucracy for members of the nobility. The upper ranks of
the bureaucracy came close to constituting a hereditary caste.
Like his predecessors, Frederick the Great took a great
interest in military affairs and enlarged the Prussian army
(to 200,000 men). Unlike his predecessors, he had no objection to using it. Frederick did not hesitate to take advantage of a succession crisis in the Habsburg monarchy to
seize the Austrian province of Silesia for Prussia. This act
aroused Austria’s bitter hostility toward Prussia and embroiled Frederick in two major wars, the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years’ War. Although the
latter war left his country exhausted, Frederick succeeded in
keeping Silesia. After the wars, the first partition of Poland
with Austria and Russia in 1772 won him the Polish territory between Prussia and Brandenburg and gave greater
unity to the scattered lands of Prussia. By the end of his
reign, Prussia was recognized as a great European power.
The Austrian Empire of the Habsburgs The Austrian
Empire had become one of the great European states by
the beginning of the eighteenth century. The city of
Vienna, center of the Habsburg monarchy, was filled with
magnificent palaces and churches built in the Baroque
style and became the music capital of Europe. Yet the
sprawling assemblage of nationalities, languages, religions, and cultures that was Austria made it difficult to
provide common laws and administrative centralization
for its people. Although Empress Maria Theresa (1740--
1780) managed to make administrative reforms that
helped centralize the Austrian Empire, these reforms were
done for practical reasons---to strengthen the power of the
Habsburg state---and were accompanied by an enlargement and modernization of the armed forces. Maria
Theresa remained staunchly Catholic and conservative
and was not open to the wider reform calls of the philosophes. But her successor was.
Joseph II (1780--1790) was determined to make
changes; at the same time, he carried on his mother’s chief
goal of enhancing Habsburg power within the monarchy
and Europe. Joseph was an earnest man who believed in
the need to sweep away anything standing in the path of
reason. As he expressed it, ‘‘I have made Philosophy the
lawmaker of my empire; her logical applications are going
to transform Austria.’’
Joseph’s reform program was far-reaching. He abolished serfdom and tried to give the peasants hereditary
rights to their holdings. A new penal code was instituted
that abrogated the death penalty and established the
principle of equality of all before the law. Joseph introduced drastic religious reforms as well, including complete
religious toleration and restrictions on the Catholic church.
Altogether, Joseph II issued six thousand decrees and
eleven thousand laws in his effort to transform his empire.
Joseph’s reform program proved overwhelming for
Austria, however. He alienated the nobility by freeing the
serfs and alienated the church by his attacks on the monastic establishment. Even the newly freed peasants were
unhappy, unable to comprehend the drastic changes inherent in Joseph’s policies. His attempt to rationalize the
administration of the empire by imposing German as the
official bureaucratic language alienated the non-German
nationalities. As Joseph complained, there were not
enough people for the kind of bureaucracy he needed. His
deep sense of failure is revealed in the epitaph he wrote
for his gravestone: ‘‘Here lies Joseph II, who was unfortunate in everything that he undertook.’’ His successors
undid many of his reform efforts.
Russia Under Catherine the Great Peter the Great was
followed by six successors who were made and unmade
by the palace guard. After the last of these, Peter III, was
murdered by a faction of nobles, his German wife
emerged as autocrat of all the Russians (see the
box above). Catherine II (1762--1796) was an intelligent
woman who was familiar with the works of the philosophes. She claimed that she wished to reform Russia
along the lines of Enlightenment ideas, but she was always shrewd enough to realize that her success depended
on the support of the palace guard and the gentry class
from which it stemmed. She could not afford to alienate
the Russian nobility.
Initially, Catherine seemed eager to pursue reform.
She called for the election of an assembly in 1767 to
debate the details of a new law code. In her Instruction,
written as a guide to the deliberations, Catherine
questioned the institution of serfdom, torture, and
capital punishment and even advocated the principle of
the equality of all people in the eyes of the law. But a
year and a half of negotiation produced little real
change.
In fact, Catherine’s subsequent policies had the effect of strengthening the landholding class at the expense
of all others, especially the Russian serfs. To reorganize
local government, Catherine divided Russia into fifty
provinces, each of which was in turn subdivided into
districts ruled by officials chosen by the nobles. In this
way, the local nobility became responsible for the dayto-day governing of Russia. Moreover, the gentry were
now formed into corporate groups with special legal
privileges, including the right to trial by peers and exemption from personal taxation and corporal punishment. The Charter of the Nobility formalized these
rights in 1785.
Catherine’s policy of
favoring the landed nobility led to even worse
conditions for the Russian peasants and provoked a rebellion. Led
by an illiterate Cossack,
Emelyan Pugachev, the
rebellion spread across
southern Russia. But the
insurrection soon faltered,
and Pugachev was captured, tortured, and executed. Catherine responded
to the failed revolt with
even harsher measures
against the peasantry. All rural reform was halted, and
serfdom was expanded into new parts of the empire.
Catherine proved a worthy successor to Peter the
Great by expanding Russia’s territory westward into Poland and southward to the Black Sea. Russia gained land
to the south by defeating the Ottoman Turks. In the
Treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji in 1774, the Russians also
gained the privilege of protecting Greek Orthodox
Christians in the Ottoman Empire. Russian expansion
westward came at the expense of neighboring Poland. In
the three partitions of Poland in 1772, 1793, and 1795,
Russia gained about 50 percent of Polish territory; Austria
and Prussia took the rest.
Enlightened Absolutism Revisited
Of the three major rulers most closely associated traditionally with enlightened absolutism---Joseph II, Frederick
II, and Catherine the Great---only Joseph sought truly
radical changes based on Enlightenment ideas. Both
Frederick and Catherine liked to be cast as disciples of the
Enlightenment, expressed interest in enlightened reforms,
and even attempted some. But the policies of neither
seemed seriously affected by Enlightenment thought.
Necessities of state and maintenance of the existing system took precedence over reform. Indeed, many historians maintain that Joseph, Frederick, and Catherine were
all guided primarily by a concern for the power and wellbeing of their states and that their policies were not all
that different from those of their predecessors. In the final
analysis, state power was used to build armies and wage
wars to gain even more power. Nevertheless, in their
desire to forge stronger state systems, these rulers did
pursue such enlightened ideas as legal reform, religious
toleration, and the extension of education, since these
served to create more satisfied subjects and strengthened
the state in significant ways.
It would be foolish, however, to overlook the fact that
not only military but also political and social realities
limited the ability of enlightened rulers to make reforms.
Everywhere in Europe, the hereditary aristocracy was still
the most powerful class in society. Enlightened reforms
were often limited to changes in the administrative and
judicial systems that did not seriously undermine the
powerful interests of the European nobility. Although
aristocrats might join the populace in opposing monarchical extension of centralizing power, as the chief beneficiaries of a system based on traditional rights and
privileges for their class, they were certainly not willing to
support a political ideology that trumpeted the principle
of equal rights for all.
Wars and Diplomacy
Q Focus Question: What were the causes and results of
the Seven Years’ War?
The philosophes condemned war as a foolish waste of life
and resources in stupid quarrels of no value to humankind. Despite their words, the rivalry among states that
led to costly struggles remained unchanged in the European world of the eighteenth century. Europe consisted of
a number of self-governing states guided by the selfinterest of the ruler. And as Frederick the Great of Prussia
said, ‘‘The fundamental rule of governments is the principle of extending their territories.’’
International rivalry and the continuing centralization of the European states were closely related. The need
for taxes to support large armies and navies created its
own imperative for more efficient and effective control of
power in the hands of bureaucrats who could collect taxes
and organize states for the task of winning wars. At the
same time, the development of large standing armies
ensured that political disputes would periodically be resolved by armed conflict rather than diplomacy. Between
1715 and 1740, it had seemed that Europe preferred
peace. But in 1740, a major conflict erupted over the
succession to the Austrian throne.
After the death of the Habsburg emperor Charles VI
(1711--1740), King Frederick II of Prussia took advantage
of the succession of Maria Theresa to the throne of
Austria by invading Austrian Silesia. The vulnerability of
Maria Theresa encouraged France to enter the war against
its traditional enemy, Austria; in turn, Maria Theresa
made an alliance with Great Britain, which feared French
hegemony over Continental affairs. All too quickly, the
Austrian succession had set off a worldwide conflagration.
The War of the Austrian Succession (1740--1748) was
fought not only in Europe, where Prussia seized Silesia
and France occupied the Austrian Netherlands, but also
in the East, where France took Madras in India from the
British, and in North America, where the British captured
the French fortress of Louisbourg at the entrance to the
Saint Lawrence River. By 1748, all parties were exhausted
and agreed to a peace that guaranteed the return of all
occupied territories except for Silesia to their original
owners. Prussia’s refusal to return Silesia guaranteed another war, at least between the two hostile central European powers of Prussia and Austria.
The Seven Years’ War (1756--1763)
Maria Theresa refused to accept the loss of Silesia and
prepared for its return by rebuilding her army while
working diplomatically to separate Prussia from its chief
ally, France. In 1756, Austria achieved what was soon
labeled a diplomatic revolution. French-Austrian rivalry
had been a fact of European diplomacy since the late
sixteenth century. But two new rivalries made this old one
seem superfluous: Britain and France over colonial empires and Austria and Prussia over Silesia. France abandoned Prussia and allied with Austria. Russia, which saw
Prussia as a major hindrance to Russian goals in central
Europe, joined the new alliance. In turn, Great Britain
allied with Prussia. This diplomatic revolution of 1756
now led to another worldwide war.
There were three major areas of conflict: Europe,
India, and North America (see Map 18.2). Europe witnessed the clash of the two major alliances: the British
and Prussians against the Austrians, Russians, and French.
With his superb army and military prowess, Frederick the
Great of Prussia was able for some time to dominate the
Austrian, French, and Russian armies. Eventually, however, Frederick’s forces were worn down and faced defeat
until a new Russian tsar, Peter III, withdrew Russia’s
troops from the conflict. His withdrawal guaranteed a
stalemate and resuscitated the desire for peace. The European conflict was ended by the Peace of Hubertusburg
in 1763. All occupied territories were returned, with the
exception that Austria officially recognized Prussia’s permanent control of Silesia.
The Anglo-French struggle in the rest of the world
had more decisive results. Known as the Great War for
Empire, it was fought in India and North America. The
French had returned Madras to Britain after the War
of the Austrian Succession, but jockeying for power
continued as the French and British supported opposing
native Indian princes. The British under Robert Clive
(1725--1774) ultimately won out, not because they
had better forces but because they were more persistent
(see the box on p. 389). By the Treaty of Paris in 1763, the
French withdrew and left India to the British.
By far the greatest conflicts of the Seven Years’ War
took place in North America (where the war was known
as the French and Indian War). There were two primary
areas of contention. One consisted of the waterways of
the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, protected by the fortress of
Louisbourg and by forts near the Great Lakes and Lake
Champlain that protected French Quebec and French
traders. The other was the unsettled Ohio River valley. As
the French moved south from the Great Lakes and north
from their forts on the Mississippi, they began to establish
forts from the Appalachians to the Mississippi River. To
British settlers in the thirteen colonies to the east, this
French activity threatened to cut off a vast area of the
continent from British exploitation.
Despite initial French successes, British fortunes were
revived by the efforts of William Pitt the Elder, who was
convinced that the destruction of the French colonial
empire was a prerequisite for the survival of Britain’s own
colonial empire. Accordingly, Pitt decided to make a
minimal effort in Europe while concentrating resources,
especially the British navy, on the war in the colonies.
Although French troops were greater in number, the
ability of the French to use them in the New World was
contingent on naval support. The defeat of French fleets
in major naval battles in 1759 gave the British an advantage because the French could no longer easily reinforce their garrisons. A series of British victories soon
followed. On the night of September 13, 1759, British
forces led by General James Wolfe scaled the heights
outside Quebec and defeated the French under General
Louis-Joseph Montcalm on the Plains of Abraham. Both
generals died in the battle. The British went on to seize
Montreal, the Great Lakes area, and the Ohio valley. The
French were forced to make peace. By the Treaty of Paris,
they ceded Canada and the lands east of the Mississippi to
England. Their ally Spain transferred Spanish Florida to
British control; in return, the French gave their Louisiana
territory to the Spanish. By 1763, Great Britain had become the world’s greatest colonial power.
Economic Expansion
and Social Change
Q Focus Question: What changes occurred in
agriculture, finance, industry, and trade during the
eighteenth century?
The eighteenth century witnessed the beginning of economic changes in Europe that ultimately had a strong impact on the rest of the world. Rapid population growth, an
agricultural revolution, industrialization, and an increase in
worldwide trade characterized these new economic patterns.
Population and Food
Europe’s population began to grow around
1750 and continued a slow but steady rise,
with some regional variations. It has been
estimated that the total European population was around 120 million in 1700, expanded to 140 million by 1750, and grew to
190 million by 1790; thus the growth rate in
the second half of the century was double
that of the first half. These increases occurred during the same time that several
million Europeans were going abroad as
colonists. A falling death rate was perhaps
the most important cause of population
growth. More plentiful food and better
transportation of available food supplies led
to some improvement in diet and relief from
devastating famines. Also of great significance in lowering death rates was the disappearance of bubonic plague.
More food was in part a result of improvements in agricultural practices and
methods in the eighteenth century, especially
in Britain, parts of France, and the Low
Countries. Eighteenth-century agriculture was
characterized by increases in food production
that can be attributed to four interrelated
factors: more farmland, healthier and more
abundant livestock, increased yields per acre,
and an improved climate.
Climatologists believe that the ‘‘little ice
age’’ of the seventeenth century abated in the
eighteenth, especially evident in moderate
summers that provided more ideal growing conditions.
The amount of land under cultivation was increased by
abandoning the old open-field system, in which part of
the land was left to lie fallow to renew it. New crops, such
as alfalfa and clover, which stored nitrogen in their roots,
restored the soil’s fertility and also provided winter fodder
for livestock, enabling landlords to maintain an everlarger number of animals. The more numerous livestock
made available more animal manure, which was used to
fertilize fields and produce better yields per acre. Also
important to the increased yields was the spread of new
vegetables, including two important American crops, the
potato and maize (Indian corn). Although they were not
grown in quantity until after 1700, they had been brought
to Europe from America in the sixteenth century and
were part of the Columbian exchange---the reciprocal
exchange of plants and animals between Europe and
America. The potato became a staple in Germany, the
Low Countries, and especially Ireland, where repression
by British landlords forced large numbers of poor peasants to survive on small pieces of marginal land. The
potato took relatively little effort to produce in large
quantities. High in carbohydrates and calories and rich in
vitamins A and C, it could be easily stored for winter use.
In the eighteenth century, the English were the leaders
in adopting the new techniques that have been characterized as an agricultural revolution. This early modernization of English agriculture with its noticeable
increase in productivity made possible the feeding of an
expanding population.
Family, Marriage, and Birthrate Patterns
The family, rather than the individual, was still at the heart
of Europe’s social organization. For the most part, people
still thought of the family in traditional terms, as a patriarchal institution with the husband dominating his wife and
children. The upper classes in particular were still concerned
for the family as a ‘‘house,’’ an association whose collective
interests were more important than those of its individual
members. In all social classes, parents, especially the fathers,
still generally selected marriage partners for their children,
based on the interests of the family (see the box on p. 390).
One French noble responded to his son’s inquiry about his
upcoming marriage, ‘‘Mind your own business.’’
In most of Europe, newly married couples established
their own households independent of their parents. This
nuclear family, which had its beginning in the Middle Ages,
had become a common pattern, especially in northwestern
Europe. To save up what they needed to establish their own
households, both men and women (outside the aristocracy)
married quite late; the average age for men in northwestern
Europe was between twenty-seven and twenty-eight; for
women, between twenty-five and twenty-seven.
Late marriages imposed limits on the birthrate; in
fact, they might be viewed as a natural form of birth
control. For married couples, the first child usually appeared within one year of marriage, and additional children came at intervals of two or three years, producing an
average of five births per family. It would appear, then,
that the birthrate had the potential of causing a significant
increase in population. This possibility was restricted,
however, because 40 to 60 percent of European women of
childbearing age (between fifteen and forty-four) were not
married at any given time. Moreover, by the end of the
eighteenth century, especially among the upper classes in
France and Britain, birth control techniques were being
used to limit the number of children. Figures for the
French aristocracy indicate that the average number of
children declined from six in the period between 1650 and
1700 to three between 1700 and 1750 and to two between
1750 and 1780. These figures are even more significant
when one considers that aristocrats married at younger
ages than the rest of the population. Coitus interruptus
remained the most common form of birth control.
New Methods of Finance
A decline in the supply of gold and silver in the seventeenth century had created a chronic shortage of money
that undermined the efforts of governments to meet their
needs. The establishment of new public and private banks
and the acceptance of paper notes made possible an expansion of credit in the eighteenth century.
Perhaps the best example of this process can be observed in England, where the Bank of England was founded
in 1694. Unlike other banks accustomed to receiving deposits and exchanging foreign currencies, the Bank of England also made loans. In return for lending money to the
government, the bank was allowed to issue paper ‘‘banknotes’’ backed by its credit. These soon became negotiable
and provided a paper substitute for gold and silver currency.
European Industry
The most important product of European industry in the
eighteenth century was textiles, most of which were still
produced by traditional methods. In cities that were textile
centers, master artisans used time-worn methods to turn
out finished goods in their guild workshops. But textile
production was shifting to the countryside in parts of
Europe by the eighteenth century. Industrial production
in the countryside was done by the so-called putting-out
or domestic system, in which a merchant-capitalist entrepreneur bought the raw materials, mostly wool and
flax, and ‘‘put them out’’ to rural workers, who spun the
raw material into yarn and then wove it into cloth on
simple looms. Capitalist entrepreneurs sold the finished
product, made a profit, and used the profit to manufacture more. This system became known as the cottage
industry because spinners and weavers did their work at
home, in their own cottages. The cottage industry was
truly a family enterprise---women and children could spin
while men wove on the looms, enabling rural people to
supplement their pitiful wages as agricultural laborers.
The cottage system spread to many areas of rural Europe
in the eighteenth century. But in the second half of the
century, significant changes began to occur that would
soon revolutionize industrial production (see Chapter 20).
Mercantile Empires and Worldwide Trade
As we saw in Chapter 14, the growth of commercial
capitalism led to integrated markets, joint-stock trading
companies, and banking and stock exchange facilities.
Mercantilist theory had posited that a nation should
acquire as much gold and silver as possible;
that there should be a favorable balance of
trade, or more exports than imports; and that
the state should provide subsidies to manufacturers, grant monopolies to traders, build
roads and canals, and impose high tariffs to
limit imports. Colonies were also seen as
valuable sources of raw materials and markets
for finished goods. Mercantilist theory on the
role of colonies was matched in practice by
Europe’s overseas expansion. With the development of colonies and trading posts in the
Americas, Asia, and Africa, Europeans embarked on an adventure in international commerce. This increase in overseas trade has led
some historians to speak of the emergence of a
truly global economy in the eighteenth century.
During the eighteenth century, trade between European states and their colonies increased dramatically. In 1715, 19 percent of
Britain’s trade was with its American colonies;
by 1785, that figure had nearly doubled to
34 percent. The increasing trade of Europe
with the Americas, Africa, and Asia was also
visible in the growth of merchant fleets. The British, for
example, had 3,300 merchant ships carrying 260,000 tons
in 1700; by 1775, those numbers had increased to 9,400
ships carrying 695,000 tons.
Flourishing trade also had a significant impact on the
European economy, especially visible in the growth of
towns and cities. The rise of the Atlantic trade led to great
prosperity for such port cities as Bordeaux, Nantes, and
Marseilles in France, Bristol and Liverpool in Britain, and
Lisbon and Oporto in Portugal. Trade also led to the
growth of related industries, such as textile manufacturing, sugar refining, and tobacco processing, and an increase in dock workers, building tradesmen, servants, and
service people of various sorts. Visitors’ accounts of their
visits to prosperous port cities detail the elegant buildings
and affluent lifestyle they encountered.
The Social Order of the
Eighteenth Century
Q Focus Question: Who were the main groups making
up the European social order in the eighteenth
century, and how did the conditions in which they
lived differ both between groups and between different
parts of Europe?
The pattern of Europe’s social organization, first established in the Middle Ages, continued well into the
eighteenth century. Social status was still largely determined not by wealth and economic standing but by the
division into the traditional ‘‘orders’’ or ‘‘estates’’ determined by heredity. This ‘‘divinely sanctioned’’ division of society into traditional orders was supported by
Christian teaching, which emphasized the need to fulfill
the responsibilities of one’s estate. Although Enlightenment intellectuals attacked these traditional distinctions, they did not die easily. In the Prussian law code
of 1794, marriage between noble males and middle-class
females was forbidden without a government dispensation. Even without government regulation, however,
different social groups remained easily distinguished everywhere in Europe by the distinctive, traditional clothes
they wore.
Nevertheless, some forces of change were at work in
this tradition-bound society. The ideas of the Enlightenment made headway as reformers argued that the idea of
an unchanging social order based on privilege was hostile
to the progress of society. However, not until the revolutionary upheavals at the end of the eighteenth century
did the old order finally begin to disintegrate.
The Peasants
Because society was still mostly rural in the eighteenth
century, the peasantry constituted the largest social group,
making up as much as 85 percent of Europe’s population.
There were rather wide differences, however, between
peasants from area to area. The most important distinction, at least legally, was between the free peasant and the
serf. Peasants in Britain, northern Italy, the Low Countries, Spain, most of France, and some areas of western
Germany shared freedom despite numerous regional and
local differences. Legally free peasants, however, were not
exempt from burdens. Some free peasants in Andalusia in
Spain, southern Italy, Sicily, and Portugal lived in a
poverty more desperate than that of many serfs in Russia
and eastern Germany. In France, 40 percent of free peasants owned little or no land by 1789.
Small peasant proprietors or tenant farmers in
western Europe were also not free from compulsory
services. Most owed tithes, often one-third of their crops.
Although tithes were intended for parish priests, in
France only 10 percent of the priests received them. Instead they wound up in the hands of wealthy townspeople
and aristocratic landowners. Moreover, in addition to
giving up their crops, some peasants owed a variety of
dues and fees. Local aristocrats claimed hunting rights on
peasant land and had monopolies over the flour mills,
community ovens, and wine and oil presses needed by the
peasants. Hunting rights, dues, fees, and tithes were all
deeply resented.
The local villages in which they dwelt remained the
centers of peasants’ social lives. Villages, especially in
western Europe, maintained public order; provided poor
relief, a village church, and sometimes a schoolmaster;
collected taxes for the central government; maintained
roads and bridges; and established common procedures for
sowing, plowing, and harvesting crops. But villages were
often dominated by richer peasants and proved highly
resistant to innovations, such as new agricultural practices.
The Nobility
The nobles, who constituted only 2 to 3 percent of the
European population, played a dominating role in society. Being born a noble automatically guaranteed a place
at the top of the social order, with all of the attendant
special privileges and rights. The legal privileges of the
nobility included judgment by their peers, immunity
from severe punishment, and exemption from many forms
of taxation. Especially in central and eastern Europe, the
rights of landlords over their serfs were overwhelming.
Nobles also played important roles in military and
government affairs. Since medieval times, landed aristocrats had functioned as military officers. Although commoners occasionally became officers, nobles were still
considered the most natural and hence the best officers.
The eighteenth-century nobility also played a significant
role in the administrative machinery of state. In some
countries, such as Prussia, the entire bureaucracy reflected
aristocratic values. Moreover, in most of Europe, the
landholding nobles controlled much of the life of their
local districts.
Although the nobles clung to their privileged status
and struggled to keep others out, almost everywhere the
possession of money made it possible to enter the ranks
of the nobility. Rights of nobility were frequently attached
to certain lands, so purchasing the lands made one a
noble; the acquisition of government offices also often
conferred noble status.
The Inhabitants of Towns and Cities
Townspeople were still a distinct minority of the total
population except in the Dutch Republic, Britain, and parts
of Italy. At the end of the eighteenth century, about onesixth of the French population lived in towns of two
thousand inhabitants or more. The biggest city in Europe
was London, with one million inhabitants; Paris numbered
between 550,000 and 600,000. Altogether, Europe had at
least twenty cities in twelve countries with populations over
100,000, including Naples, Lisbon, Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Vienna, Amsterdam, Berlin, Rome, and Madrid.
Although in every country urban dwellers were vastly
outnumbered by rural inhabitants, towns played an important role in Western culture. The contrasts between
the city, with its education, culture, and material consumption, and the surrounding, often poverty-stricken
countryside were striking, as evidenced by this British
traveler’s account of Russia’s Saint Petersburg in 1741:
The country about Petersburg has full as wild and desert a
look as any in the Indies; you need not go above 200 paces
out of the town to find yourself in a wild wood of firs, and
such a low, marshy, boggy country that you would think
God when he created the rest of the world for the use of
mankind had created this for an inaccessible retreat for all
sorts of wild beasts.3
Peasants often resented the prosperity of towns and their
exploitation of the countryside to serve urban interests.
Palermo in Sicily consumed one-third of the island’s food
production while paying only one-tenth of the taxes.
Towns lived off the countryside not by buying their goods
and crops but by using tithes, rents, and feudal dues to
acquire peasant produce.
Many cities in western and even central Europe had
a long tradition of patrician oligarchies that continued
to control their communities by dominating town and
city councils. Despite their highly visible role, patricians
constituted only a small minority of the urban population. Just below the patricians stood an upper crust of
the middle classes: nonnoble officeholders, financiers
and bankers, merchants, wealthy rentiers who lived off
their investments, and important professionals, including lawyers. Another large urban group was the
petty bourgeoisie or lower middle class, made up of
master artisans, shopkeepers, and small traders. Below
them were the laborers or working classes. Much urban
industry was still done in small guild workshops by
masters, journeymen, and apprentices. Urban communities also had a large group of unskilled workers who
served as servants, maids, and cooks at pitifully low
wages.
Despite an end to the ravages of plague, eighteenthcentury cities still experienced high death rates, especially
among children, because of unsanitary living conditions,
polluted water, and a lack of sewage facilities. One observer compared the stench of Hamburg to an open sewer
that could be smelled for miles around. Overcrowding
also exacerbated urban problems as cities continued to
absorb rural immigrants. But cities proved no paradise
for them, for unskilled workers found few employment
opportunities. The result was a serious problem of poverty in the eighteenth century (see the box on p. 394).
CONCLUSION
Everywhere in Europe at the beginning of the eighteenth century,
the old order remained strong. Nobles, clerics, towns, and provinces
all had privileges, some medieval in origin, others the result of the
attempt of monarchies in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to
gain financial support from their subjects. Everywhere in the
eighteenth century, monarchs sought to enlarge their bureaucracies
to raise taxes to support the new large standing armies that had
originated in the seventeenth century. The existence of these armies
made wars more likely. The existence of five great powers, two of
them (France and Britain) in conflict in the East and the New
World, initiated a new scale of strife; the Seven Years’ War could
legitimately be viewed as the first world war. The wars altered some
boundaries on the European continent but were perhaps more
significant for the victories that marked the emergence of Great
Britain as the world’s greatest naval and colonial power. Everywhere
in Europe, increased demands for taxes to support these conflicts
led to attacks on the privileged orders and a desire for change not
met by the ruling monarchs.
At the same time, sustained population growth; dramatic
changes in finance, trade, and industry; and the growth of poverty
created tensions that undermined the traditional foundations of the
old order. The inability of that old order to deal meaningfully with
these changes led to a revolutionary outburst at the end of the
eighteenth century.
