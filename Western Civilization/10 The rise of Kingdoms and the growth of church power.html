<h2 id="org6cc79bd">10 The rise of Kingdoms and the growth of church power</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6cc79bd">
<p class="verse">
The period from 1000 to 1300 was a dynamic time in the development of Western civilization.<br />
The nobles, whose warlike attitudes were rationalized<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;by labeling themselves the defenders of Christian society,<br />
&#xa0;continued to dominate the medieval world politically, economically, and socially.<br />
But kings gradually began to expand their powers.<br />
Although the popes sometimes treated rulers condescendingly,<br />
&#xa0;by the thirteenth century, the monarchs were developing the machinery of government<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that would enable them to challenge exalted claims of papal power<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;and assume political authority in Europe.<br />
The actions of these medieval monarchs laid the foundation for the European kingdoms<br />
&#xa0;that in one form or another have dominated the European political scene ever since.<br />
<br />
The Catholic church shared in the challenge of new growth<br />
&#xa0;by reforming itself and striking out on a path toward greater papal power,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;both within the church and over European society.<br />
The High Middle Ages witnessed a spiritual renewal that led to numerous and even divergent paths:<br />
&#xa0;revived papal leadership,<br />
&#xa0;the development of centralized administrative machinery that buttressed papal authority,<br />
&#xa0;and new dimensions to the religious life of the clergy and laity.<br />
At the same time,<br />
&#xa0;this spiritual renewal also gave rise to the crusading 'holy warrior' who killed for God,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;which created an animosity between Christians and Muslims<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;that still has repercussions to this day.<br />
<br />
The religious enthusiasm of the twelfth century continued well into the thirteenth<br />
&#xa0;as new orders of friars gave witness to spiritual growth and passion,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;but underneath lay seeds of discontent and change.<br />
Dissent from church teaching and practices grew,<br />
&#xa0;leading to a climate of fear and intolerance<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;as the church responded with inquisitorial procedures to enforce conformity to its teachings.<br />
At the same time,<br />
&#xa0;papal claims of supremacy over secular authorities<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;were increasingly challenged by the rising power of monarchical authorities,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;who, because of the growth of cities,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;the revival of trade, and the emergence of a money economy,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;were now able to hire soldiers and officials to carry out their wishes.<br />
<br />
The High Middle Ages of the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries<br />
&#xa0;had been a period of great innovation,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;evident in significant economic,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;social, political, religious, intellectual, and cultural changes.<br />
And yet by the end of the thirteenth century,<br />
&#xa0;certain tensions had begun to creep into European society.<br />
As we shall see in the next chapter, these tensions would soon bring a torrent of troubles.<br />

<p>
Over a period of 1000 to 1300, nobles continued to dominate the Medieval world.<br />
Although they sometimes were treated condescendingly by popes,<br />
	the kings developed a machinery of government<br />
		that not only enabled them to challenge the exalted claim of papal power,<br />
			but also made them dominate European politics in one form or another.<br />
The High Middle Ages witnessed a new spiritual renewal which<br />
	led to divergent paths:<br />
		the revived papal leadership,<br />
		the development of a centralized administrative system that buttressed papal authority,<br />
		and the new dimensions of the religious life of the clergy and laity.<br />
The renewal also gave rise to the crusading warriors<br />
	who created an animosity between Christians and Muslims.<br />
In the thirteenth century,<br />
	friars gave witness to the spiritual growth<br />
	and the growth of dissent from church teaching and practices<br />
		to which the papal power responded with inquisitorial procedures.<br />
At the same time,<br />
	the exalted claims of papal power<br />
		were gradually challenged by the rising power of monarchical authorities<br />
			who could hire soldiers and officials because of the growth of trade and cities.<br />
There was significant innovation in economic, political, cultural, and religious changes.<br />
