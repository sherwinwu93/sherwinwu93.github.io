<h2 id="orge7e8aad">25 British troops in the trenches wait for the signal to attack</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge7e8aad">
<p class="verse">
On July 1, 1916, British and French infantry forces attacked German defensive lines<br />
&#xa0;along a 25-mile front near the Somme River in France.<br />
Each soldier carried almost 70 pounds of equipment,<br />
&#xa0;making it impossible to move much quicker than a slow walk.<br />
German machine guns soon opened fire:<br />
&#xa0;'We were able to see our comrades move forward in an attempt to cross No-Man's Land,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;only to be mown down like meadow grass,' recalled one British soldier.<br />
'I felt sick at the sight of this carnage and remember weeping.'<br />
In one day, more than 21,000 British soldiers died.<br />
After six months of fighting, the British had advanced 5 miles;<br />
&#xa0;one million British, French, and German soldiers had been killed or wounded.<br />
Philip Gibbs, an English war correspondent,<br />
&#xa0;described what he saw in the German trenches that the British forces overran: Victory&#x2026;<br />
Some of the German dead were young boys, too young to be killed for old men's crimes,<br />
&#xa0;and others might have been old or young.<br />
One could not tell because they had no faces, and were just masses of raw flesh in rags of uniforms.<br />
Legs and arms lay separate without any bodies thereabout.<br />
<br />
World War I (1914&#x2013;1918) was the defining event of the twentieth century.<br />
It devastated the prewar economic, social, and political order of Europe,<br />
&#xa0;and its uncertain outcome prepared the way for an even more destructive war.<br />
Overwhelmed by the size of its battles,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;the extent of its casualties, and its effects on all facets of life,<br />
&#xa0;contemporaries referred to it simply as the 'Great War.'<br />
<br />
The Great War was all the more disturbing to Europeans<br />
&#xa0;because it came after what many considered an age of progress.<br />
There had been international crises before 1914,<br />
&#xa0;but somehow Europeans had managed to avoid serious and prolonged military confrontations.<br />
Material prosperity and a fervid belief in scientific and technological progress<br />
&#xa0;had convinced many people<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that the world was on the verge of creating the utopia that humans had dreamed of for centuries.<br />
<br />
After 1918, it was no longer possible<br />
&#xa0;to maintain naive illusions about the progress of Western civilization.<br />
As World War I was followed by the destructiveness of World War II<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and the mass murder machines of totalitarian regimes,<br />
&#xa0;it became all too apparent that instead of a utopia, European civilization had become a nightmare.<br />
The Great War resulted not only in great loss of life and property<br />
&#xa0;but also in the annihilation of one of the basic intellectual precepts<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;on which Western civilization had been thought to have been founded&#x2014;the belief in progress.<br />
World War I and the revolutions it spawned<br />
&#xa0;can properly be seen as the first stage in the crisis of the twentieth century.<br />
