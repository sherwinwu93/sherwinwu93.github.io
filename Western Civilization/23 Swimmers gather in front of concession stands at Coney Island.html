<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6ca7744">
<p class="verse">
In the late nineteenth century, Europe was enjoying a dynamic age of material prosperity.<br />
Bringing new industries, new sources of energy, and new goods,<br />
&#xa0;a second Industrial Revolution transformed the environment,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;dazzled Europeans,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and led them to believe that their material progress was human progress.<br />
Scientific and technological achievements, many naively believed,<br />
&#xa0;would improve the human condition and solve all problems.<br />
The doctrine of progress became an article of faith.<br />
<br />
The new urban and industrial environment<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;resulting from the rapid economic changes of the nineteenth century<br />
&#xa0;led to the emergence of a mass society.<br />
With it came improvements for the lower classes,<br />
&#xa0;who benefited from the extension of voting rights,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;a better standard of living, and free education.<br />
It also brought mass leisure.<br />
New work patterns established the 'weekend' as a distinct time of recreation and fun,<br />
&#xa0;while new forms of mass transportation&#x2014;railroads and streetcars&#x2014;<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;enabled even the lowest-paid workers to make brief excursions to beaches and amusement parks.<br />
Coney Island was only 8 miles from central New York City;<br />
&#xa0;Blackpool in England was a short train ride from nearby industrial towns.<br />
With their Ferris wheels and other daring rides that threw young men and women together,<br />
&#xa0;amusement parks offered a whole new world of entertainment.<br />
Thanks to the railroad,<br />
&#xa0;seaside resorts, once the preserve of the wealthy,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;became accessible to more people for weekend visits,<br />
&#xa0;much to the disgust of one upper-class regular who described the new 'day-trippers':<br />
&#xa0;'They swarm upon the beach,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;wandering listlessly about with apparently no other aim than to get a mouthful of fresh air.'<br />
Entrepreneurs in resort areas, however, welcomed the masses of new visitors<br />
&#xa0;and built piers laden with food, drink, and entertainment to serve them.<br />
<br />
The coming of mass society also created new roles for the governments of European nation-states,<br />
&#xa0;which now fostered national loyalty, formed vast armies by conscription,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and took more responsibility for public health and housing measures in their cities.<br />
By 1871, the national state had become the focus of Europeans' lives.<br />
Within many of these nation-states,<br />
&#xa0;the growth of the middle class had led to the triumph of liberal practices:<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;constitutional governments, parliaments, and principles of equality.<br />
The period after 1871 also witnessed the growth of political democracy<br />
&#xa0;as the right to vote was extended to all adult males;<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;women, though, would still have to fight for their political rights.<br />
With political democracy came a new mass politics and a new mass press.<br />
Both would become standard features of the twentieth century.<br />
