</p>

<p>
A medieval abbot and his monks
</p>

<p>
THE RECOVERY AND GROWTH of European civilization in
the High Middle Ages also affected the state and the church. Both
lords and vassals and the Catholic church recovered from the
invasions and internal dissension of the Early Middle Ages. Although lords and vassals seemed forever mired in endless petty
conflicts, some medieval kings began to exert a centralizing authority and inaugurated the process of developing new kinds of
monarchical states. By the thirteenth century, European monarchs
were solidifying their governmental institutions in pursuit of
greater power.
</p>

<p>
The recovery of the Catholic church produced a reform
movement that led to exalted claims of papal authority. This increase in church power, coupled with the rise of monarchical
states, made it almost inevitable that there would be conflicts between church and state. At the same time, vigorous papal leadership combined with new dimensions of religious life to make the
Catholic church a forceful presence in every area of life. The role
of the church in the new European civilization was quite evident
in the career of a man named Samson, who became abbot or
head of the great English abbey of Bury Saint Edmonds in 1182.
According to Jocelyn of Brakeland, a monk who assisted him,
Abbot Samson was a devout man who wore ‘‘undergarments of
horsehair and a horsehair shirt.’’ He loved virtue and ‘‘abhorred
liars, drunkards and talkative folk.’’ His primary concern was the
spiritual well-being of his monastery, but he spent much of his
time working on problems in the world beyond the abbey walls.
Since the monastery had fallen into debt under his predecessors,
Abbot Samson toiled tirelessly to recoup the abbey’s fortunes by
carefully supervising its manors. He also rounded up murderers
to stand trial in Saint Edmunds and provided knights for the
king’s army. But his actions were not always tolerant or beneficial. He was instrumental in driving the Jews from the town of
Saint Edmunds and was not above improving the abbey’s possessions at the expense of his neighbors: ‘‘He built up the bank of
the fish-pond at Babwell so high, for the service of a new mill,
that by the keeping back the water there is not a man, rich or
poor, but has lost his garden and his orchards.’’ The abbot’s
worldly cares weighed heavily on him, but he had little choice if
his abbey were to flourish and fulfill its spiritual and secular
functions. But he did have regrets; as he remarked to Jocelyn: ‘‘If
he could have returned to the circumstances he had enjoyed before he became a monk, he would never have become a monk or
an abbot.’’
</p>

<p>
The Emergence and Growth of
European Kingdoms, 1000&#x2013;1300
</p>

<p>
Q Focus Questions: What steps did the rulers of England
and France take during the High Middle Ages to
reverse the decentralizing tendencies of fief-holding?
What were the major developments in Spain, the Holy
Roman Empire, and northern and eastern Europe
during the High Middle Ages?
</p>

<p>
The domination of society by the nobility reached its apex
in the High Middle Ages. During the same period, however, kings began the process of extending their power in
more effective ways. Out of these growing monarchies
would eventually come the European states that dominated much of later European history.
</p>

<p>
Kings possessed some sources of power that other
lords did not. Usually, kings had greater opportunities to
increase their lands through war and marriage alliances
and then could use their new acquisitions to reward
their followers and bind powerful nobles to them. In
the High Middle Ages, kings found ways to strengthen
governmental institutions and consequently to extend
their powers. The growth of cities, the revival of commerce, and the emergence of a money economy enabled
monarchs to hire soldiers and officials and to rely less on
their vassals.
</p>

<p>
England in the High Middle Ages
</p>

<p>
In 1066, an army of heavily armed knights under William
of Normandy landed on the southeastern coast of
England and soundly defeated King Harold and his
Anglo-Saxon foot soldiers at the Battle of Hastings on
October 14. William (1066&#x2013;1087) was crowned king of
England at Christmastime in London and began the
process of combining Anglo-Saxon and Norman institutions. Many of the Norman knights were given parcels of land that they held as fiefs from the new English
king. William made all nobles swear an oath of loyalty to
him and insisted that all people owed loyalty to the king
rather than to their lords.
</p>

<p>
Gradually, fusion between the victorious Normans
and the defeated Anglo-Saxons transformed England.
Although the Norman ruling class spoke French, intermarriage of the Norman-French and the Anglo-Saxon
nobility gradually blended the two cultures and vastly
enriched the English language. The Normans also took
over existing Anglo-Saxon institutions, such as the office
of sheriff. William took a census and more fully developed the system of taxation and royal courts begun by the
Anglo-Saxon kings of the tenth and eleventh centuries.
All in all, William of Normandy created a strong, centralized monarchy.
</p>

<p>
The Norman conquest of England had other repercussions as well. Because the new king of England
was still the duke of Normandy, he was both a king (of
England) and at the same time a vassal to a king (of
France), but a vassal who was now far more powerful
than his lord. This connection with France kept England
heavily involved in Continental affairs throughout the
High Middle Ages.
</p>

<p>
Henry II
</p>

<p>
In the twelfth century, the power of the English
monarchy was greatly enlarged during the reign of Henry
II (1154&#x2013;1189), the founder of the Plantagenet dynasty.
The new king was particularly successful in strengthening
the power of the royal courts. Henry expanded the
number of criminal cases tried in the king’s court and also
devised ways of taking property cases from local courts to
the royal courts. Henry’s goals were clear: expanding the
jurisdiction of royal courts extended the king’s power
and, of course, brought revenues into his coffers. Moreover, because the royal courts were now found throughout England, a body of common law (law that was
common to the whole kingdom) began to replace the
local law codes, which differed from place to place.
</p>

<p>
Henry was less successful at imposing royal control
over the church. The king claimed the right to punish
clergymen in royal courts, but Thomas a` Becket, archbishop of Canterbury and therefore the highest-ranking
English cleric, claimed that only church courts could try
clerics. Attempts at compromise failed, and the angry
king publicly expressed the desire to be rid of Becket:
‘‘Who will free me of this priest?’’ he screamed. Four
knights took the challenge, went to Canterbury, and
murdered the archbishop in the cathedral. Met with
public outrage, Henry was forced to allow the right of
appeal from English church courts to the papal court.
</p>

<p>
King John and Magna Carta
</p>

<p>
Many English nobles came
to resent the continuing growth of the king’s power and
rose in rebellion during the reign of Henry’s son, King
John (1199&#x2013;1216). At Runnymede in 1215, John was
forced to seal Magna Carta (the ‘‘Great Charter’’). Magna
Carta was, above all, a feudal document (see the box on
p. 199). Feudal custom had always recognized that the
relationship between king and vassals was based on mutual rights and obligations. Magna Carta gave written
recognition to that fact and was used in subsequent
years to strengthen the idea that the monarch’s power was
limited, not absolute.
</p>

<p>
Edward I and the Emergence of Parliament
</p>

<p>
During
the reign of Edward I (1272&#x2013;1307), an institution of
great importance in the development of representative
government&#x2014;the English Parliament&#x2014;emerged. Originally
the word parliament was applied to meetings of the king’s
Great Council in which the greater barons and chief
prelates of the church met with the king’s judges and
principal advisers to deal with judicial affairs. But out of a
need for money, Edward in 1295 invited two knights from
every county and two residents (‘‘burgesses’’) from each
town to meet with the Great Council to consent to new
taxes. This was the first Parliament.
</p>

<p>
The English Parliament, then, came to be composed
of two knights from every county and two burgesses from
every town as well as the barons and eccelesiastical lords.
Eventually, barons and church lords formed the House of
Lords; knights and burgesses, the House of Commons.
The Parliaments of Edward I granted taxes, discussed
politics, passed laws, and handled judicial business. By the
end of the thirteenth century, the law of the realm was
being determined not by the king alone but by the king in
consultation with representatives of various groups that
constituted the community.
</p>

<p>
The Growth of the French Kingdom
</p>

<p>
In 843, the Carolingian Empire had been divided into
three major sections. The west Frankish lands formed the
core of the eventual kingdom of France. In 987, after the
death of the last Carolingian king, the west Frankish
nobles chose Hugh Capet as the new king, thus establishing the Capetian dynasty of French kings. Although
they carried the title of kings, the Capetians had little real
power. They controlled as the royal domain (the lands of
the king) only the lands around Paris known as the Iˆlede-France. As kings of France, the Capetians were formally the overlords of the great lords of France, such as
the dukes of Normandy, Brittany, Burgundy, and Aquitaine. In reality, however, many of the dukes were considerably more powerful than the Capetian kings. It
would take the Capetian dynasty hundreds of years to
create a truly centralized monarchical authority in France.
</p>

<p>
The reign of King Philip II Augustus (1180&#x2013;1223)
was an important turning point. Philip II waged war
against the Plantagenet rulers of England, who also ruled
the French territories of Normandy, Maine, Anjou, and
Aquitaine, and was successful in gaining control of most of
these territories (see Map 10.1 on p. 200). Through these
conquests, Philip quadrupled the income of the French
monarchy and greatly enlarged its power. To administer
justice and collect royal revenues in his new territories,
Philip appointed new royal officials, thus inaugurating a
French royal bureaucracy.
</p>

<p>
Capetian rulers after Philip II continued to add lands
to the royal domain. Although Philip had used military
force, other kings used both purchase and marriage to
achieve the same end. Much of the thirteenth century was
dominated by Louis IX (1226&#x2013;1270), considered the
greatest of the medieval French kings. A deeply religious
man, he was later canonized as a saint by the church, an
unusual action. Louis was known for his attempts to
bring justice to his people and ensure their rights. Sharing
in the religious sentiments of his age, Louis played a
major role in two of the later Crusades, but both were
failures, and he met his death during an invasion of
North Africa.
</p>

<p>
Philip IV and the Estates-General
</p>

<p>
One of Louis’s
successors, Philip IV the Fair (1285&#x2013;1314), was particularly effective in strengthening the French monarchy. The
machinery of government became even more specialized.
French kings going back to the early Capetians had
possessed a household staff for running their affairs. Over
time, however, this household staff was enlarged and divided into three groups to form three major branches of
royal administration: a council for advice, a chamber of
accounts for finances, and a parlement or royal court. By
the beginning of the fourteenth century, the Capetians
had established firm foundations for a royal bureaucracy.
</p>

<p>
Philip IV also brought a French parliament into being
by summoning representatives of the three estates, or
classes&#x2014;the clergy (First Estate), the nobles (Second Estate), and the townspeople (Third Estate)&#x2014;to meet with
him. They did so in 1302, inaugurating the EstatesGeneral, the first French parliament, although it had little
real power. By the end of the thirteenth century, France
was the largest, wealthiest, and best-governed monarchical state in Europe.
</p>

<p>
Christian Reconquest: The Spanish Kingdoms
</p>

<p>
Much of Spain had been part of the Islamic world since
the eighth century. Muslim Spain had flourished in the
Early Middle Ages. Co´rdoba became a major urban center
with a population exceeding 300,000 people. Agriculture
prospered, and Spain became known as well for excellent
leather, wool, silk, and paper. Beginning in the tenth
century, however, the most noticeable feature of Spanish
history was the beginning of a Christian reconquest that
lasted until the final expulsion of the Muslims at the end
of the fifteenth century. The Reconquista, as the Spaniards
called it, became over a period of time a sacred mission to
many of the Christian rulers and inhabitants of the
peninsula.
</p>

<p>
By the eleventh century, a number of small Christian
kingdoms in northern Spain took the offensive against
the Muslims. Rodrigo Dı´az de Vivar, known as El Cid
(‘‘The Master’’), was the most famous military adventurer
of the time. Unlike the Christian warriors of France, El
Cid fought under either Christian or Muslim rulers. He
carved out his own kingdom of Valencia in 1094 but
failed to create a dynasty when it was reconquered by the
Muslims after his death.
</p>

<p>
By the end of the twelfth century, the northern half of
Spain had been consolidated into the Christian kingdoms
of Castile, Navarre, Aragon, and Portugal, the last of
which had emerged by 1179 as a separate kingdom (see
Map 10.2). The southern half of Spain remained under
the control of the Muslims.
</p>

<p>
In the thirteenth century, Christian rulers took the offensive again in the reconquest of Muslim territory. Aragon
and Castile had become the two strongest Spanish kingdoms, and Portugal had reached its modern boundaries. All
three states made significant conquests of Muslim territory.
Castile subdued most of Andalusia in the south, down to
the Atlantic and the Mediterranean; at the same time,
Aragon conquered Valencia. The crucial battle occurred in
1212 at Las Navas de Tolosa. Alfonso VIII of Castile (1155&#x2013;
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>had amassed an army of sixty thousand and crushed</li>
</ol>
<p>
the Muslim forces, leading to Christian victories over the
next forty years. By the mid-thirteenth century, the Muslims
remained only in the kingdom of Granada, along the
southeastern edge of the Iberian peninsula.
</p>

<p>
The Spanish kingdoms followed no consistent policy in
the treatment of the conquered Muslim population. Muslim farmers continued to work the land but were forced to
pay very high rents in Aragon. In Castile, King Alfonso X
(1252&#x2013;1284), who called himself the ‘‘King of Three Religions,’’ encouraged the continued development of a cosmopolitan culture shared by Christians, Jews, and Muslims.
</p>

<p>
The Lands of the Holy Roman Empire:
Germany and Italy
</p>

<p>
In the tenth century, the powerful dukes of Saxony became kings of the lands of the eastern Frankish kingdom
(or Germany, as it came to be known). The best known of
the Saxon kings of Germany was Otto I (936&#x2013;973), who
intervened in Italian politics and for his efforts was
crowned emperor of the Romans by the pope in 962,
reviving a title that had not been used since the time of
Charlemagne. Otto’s creation of a new ‘‘Roman Empire’’
in the hands of the eastern Franks (or Germans, as they
came to be called) added a tremendous burden to the
kings of Germany, who now took on the onerous task of
ruling Italy as well.
</p>

<p>
In the eleventh century, German kings created a
strong monarchy and a powerful empire by leading armies into Italy. To strengthen their power, German kings
had come to rely on their ability to control the church
and select bishops and abbots, whom they could then use
as royal administrators. But the struggle between church
and state during the reign of Henry IV (1056&#x2013;1106)
weakened the king’s ability to use church officials in this
way. The German kings also tried to bolster their power
by using their position as emperors to exploit the resources of Italy. But this tended to backfire; many a
German king lost armies in Italy in pursuit of a dream of
empire, and no German dynasty demonstrates this better
than the Hohenstaufens.
</p>

<p>
Frederick I
</p>

<p>
Both Frederick I (1152&#x2013;1190) and Frederick II
(1212&#x2013;1250), the two most famous members of the
Hohenstaufen dynasty, tried to create a new kind of
empire. Previous German kings had focused on building
a strong German kingdom, to which Italy might be added
as an appendage (see Map 10.3). Frederick I, known as
Barbarossa (‘‘Redbeard’’) to the Italians, however, planned
to get his chief revenues from Italy as the center of a
‘‘holy empire,’’ as he called it (hence the name Holy
Roman Empire). But his attempt to conquer northern
Italy ran into severe difficulties. The pope opposed him,
fearful that the emperor wanted to incorporate Rome and
the Papal States into his empire. The cities of northern
Italy, which had become used to their freedom, were
also not willing to be Frederick’s subjects. An alliance of
these northern Italian cities, with the support of the papacy, defeated the forces of Emperor Frederick at Legnano
in 1176.
</p>

<p>
Frederick II
</p>

<p>
Frederick II was the most brilliant of the
Hohenstaufen rulers. King of Sicily in 1198, king of
Germany in 1212, and crowned emperor in 1220,
Frederick II was a truly remarkable man who awed his
contemporaries. Frederick had been raised in Sicily,
with its diverse peoples, languages, and religions, and
his court brought together a brilliant
array of lawyers, poets, artists, and
scientists. His main goal was to establish a strong centralized state in
Italy dominated by his kingdom in
Sicily. Frederick’s major task was to
gain control of northern Italy. In
reaching to extend his power in Italy,
he became involved in a deadly
struggle with the popes, who realized
that a single ruler of northern and
southern Italy meant the end of papal
secular power in central Italy. The
northern Italian cities were also unwilling to give up their freedom.
Frederick waged a bitter struggle in
northern Italy, winning many battles
but ultimately losing the war.
</p>

<p>
Frederick’s preoccupation with the
creation of an empire in Italy left Germany in confusion and chaos until
1273, when the major German princes,
serving as electors, chose an insignificant German noble, Rudolf of Habsburg, as the new German king. In
choosing a weak king, the princes were
ensuring that the German monarchy
would remain impotent and incapable
of reestablishing a centralized monarchical state. The failure of the Hohenstaufens had led to a situation where
his exalted majesty, the German king
and Holy Roman Emperor, had no real
power over either Germany or Italy.
Unlike France, England, and even
Spain, neither Germany nor Italy created a unified national monarchy in the Middle Ages.
Both became geographical designations for loose confederations of hundreds of petty states under the vague
direction of king or emperor. In fact, neither Germany
nor Italy would become united until the nineteenth
century.
</p>

<p>
Following the death of Frederick II, Italy fell into
political confusion. While the papacy remained in
control of much of central Italy, the defeat of imperial
power left the cities and towns of northern Italy independent of any other authority. Gradually, the larger
ones began to emerge as strong city-states. Florence
assumed the leadership of Tuscany, and Milan, under
the guidance of the Visconti family, took control of the
Lombard region. With its great commercial wealth, the
republic of Venice dominated the northeastern part of
the peninsula.
</p>

<p>
New Kingdoms in Northern and Eastern Europe
</p>

<p>
The Scandinavian countries of northern Europe had little
political organization before 1000, and it was not until
around that time that the three Scandinavian kingdoms&#x2014;
Denmark, Norway, and Sweden (see Map 10.4)&#x2014;emerged
with a noticeable political structure. The three kingdoms
were converted to Christianity by kings who believed that an
organized church was a necessary accompaniment to an
organized state. The adoption of Christianity, however, did
not eliminate the warlike tendencies of the Scandinavians.
Not only did the three kingdoms fight each other in the
eleventh and twelfth centuries, but rival families were in
regular conflict over the throne in each state. This period also
witnessed the growth of a powerful noble landowning class.
</p>

<p>
To the south, in eastern Europe, Hungary, which had
been a Christian state since 1000, remained relatively
stable throughout the High Middle Ages, but the history
of Poland and Russia was far more turbulent. In the
thirteenth century, eastern Europe was beset by two
groups of invaders, the Teutonic Knights from the west
and the Mongols from the east.
</p>

<p>
In the eleventh century, a Polish kingdom existed as
an independent state but with no natural frontiers. German settlers encroached on its territory on a regular basis,
leading to considerable intermarriage between Slavs and
Germans. During the thirteenth century, relations between
the Germans and the Slavs of eastern Europe worsened
due to the aggression of the Teutonic Knights. The Teutonic Knights had been founded near the end of the
twelfth century to protect the Christian Holy Land. In the
early thirteenth century, however, these Christian knights
found greater opportunity to the east of Germany, where
they attacked the pagan Slavs. East Prussia was given to the
military order in 1226, and by the end of the thirteenth
century, Prussia had become German and Christian as the
pagan Slavs were forced to convert.
</p>

<p>
Central and eastern Europe had periodically been
subject to invasions from fierce Asiatic nomads, including
the Huns, Avars, Bulgars, and Magyars. In the thirteenth
century, the Mongols exploded on the scene, causing far
more disruption than earlier invaders.
</p>

<p>
Impact of the Mongol Empire
</p>

<p>
The Mongols rose to power in Asia with stunning speed.
They were a pastoral people in the region of modern-day
Outer Mongolia organized loosely in clans and tribes,
often warring with each other. This changed when one
leader, Temuchin, unified the Mongol tribes and gained
the title of Genghis Khan (c. 1162&#x2013;1227), which means
‘‘universal ruler.’’ From that time on, Genghis Khan created a powerful military force and devoted himself to
fighting. ‘‘Man’s highest joy,’’ Genghis Khan remarked, ‘‘is
in victory: to conquer one’s enemies, to pursue them, to
deprive them of their possessions, to make their beloved
weep, to ride on their horses, and to embrace their wives
and daughters.’’2 Genghis Khan was succeeded by equally
competent sons and grandsons.
</p>

<p>
In the thirteenth century, the Mongols advanced
eastward, eventually conquering China and Korea. One of
Genghis Khan’s grandsons, Khubilai Khan, completed the
conquest of China and established a new Chinese dynasty
of rulers known as the Yuan. In 1279, Khubilai Khan
moved the capital of China northward to Khanbaliq (‘‘city
of the Khan’’), which would later be known by the Chinese name Beijing.
The Mongols also moved westward against the Islamic empire. Persia fell in 1233, and by 1258, the Mongols had conquered Baghdad and destroyed the Abbasid
caliphate. In the 1230s, the Mongols also began moving
into Europe. They conquered Russia, advanced into Poland and Hungary, and destroyed a force of Poles and
Teutonic Knights in Silesia in 1241. At that point, the
Mongol hordes turned back because of internal fighting;
western and southern Europe escaped their wrath. Overall,
the Mongols had little lasting impact in Europe, although
their occupation of Russia had some residual effect.
</p>

<p>
The Development of Russia
</p>

<p>
The Kiev Rus state, which had become formally Christian
in 987, prospered considerably afterward, reaching its
high point in the first half of the eleventh century. Kievan
society was dominated by a noble class of landowners
known as the boyars. Kievan merchants maintained
regular trade with Scandinavia to the north and the Islamic and Byzantine worlds to the south. But destructive
civil wars and new invasions by Asiatic nomads caused
the principality of Kiev to collapse, and the sack of Kiev
by north Russian princes in 1169 brought an inglorious
end to the first Russian state.
</p>

<p>
The fundamental civilizing and unifying force of
early Russia was the Christian church. The Russian
church imitated the liturgy and organization of the Byzantine Empire, whose Eastern Orthodox priests had
converted the Kievan Rus to Christianity at the end of the
tenth century. The Russian church became known for its
rigid religious orthodoxy. Although Christianity provided
a common bond between Russian and European civilization, Russia’s religious development guaranteed an even
closer affinity between Russian and Byzantine civilization.
</p>

<p>
In the thirteenth century, the Mongols conquered
Russia and cut it off even more from western Europe. The
Mongols were not numerous enough to settle the vast
Russian lands but were content to rule directly an area
along the lower Volga and north of the Caspian and Black
Seas to Kiev and rule indirectly elsewhere. In the latter
territories, Russian princes were required to pay tribute to
the Mongol overlords.
</p>

<p>
One Russian prince soon emerged as more powerful
than the others. Alexander Nevsky (c. 1220&#x2013;1263), prince
of Novgorod, defeated a German invading army in
northwestern Russia in 1242. His cooperation with the
Mongols won him their favor. The khan, leader of the
western part of the Mongol empire, rewarded Nevsky
with the title of grand prince, enabling his descendants to
become the princes of Moscow and eventually leaders of
all Russia.
</p>

<p>
The Recovery and Reform
of the Catholic Church
</p>

<p>
Q Focus Question: What was at issue in the Investiture
Controversy, and what effect did the controversy
have on the church and on Germany?
</p>

<p>
In the Early Middle Ages, the Catholic church had played a
leading role in converting and civilizing first the Germanic
invaders and later the Vikings and Magyars. Although
highly successful, this effort brought challenges that undermined the spiritual life of the church itself.
</p>

<p>
The Problems of Decline
</p>

<p>
Since the eighth century, the popes had reigned supreme
over the affairs of the Catholic church. They had also come
to exercise control over the territories in central Italy
known as the Papal States; this kept popes involved in
political matters, often at the expense of their spiritual
obligations. At the same time, the church became increasingly entangled in the evolving lord-vassal relationships.
High officials of the church, such as bishops and abbots,
came to hold their offices as fiefs from nobles. As vassals,
they were obliged to carry out the usual duties, including
military service. Of course, lords assumed the right to
choose their vassals, even when those vassals included
bishops and abbots. Because lords often selected their
vassals from other noble families for political reasons, these
bishops and abbots were often worldly figures who cared
little about their spiritual responsibilities.
</p>

<p>
The monastic ideal had also suffered during the Early
Middle Ages. Benedictine monasteries had sometimes
been exemplary centers of Christian living and learning,
but the invasions of Vikings, Magyars, and Muslims
wreaked havoc with many monastic establishments.
Discipline declined, and with it the monastic reputation
for learning and holiness. At the same time, a growing
number of monasteries fell under the control of local
lords, as did much of the church. A number of people
believed that the time for reform had come.
</p>

<p>
The Cluniac Reform Movement
</p>

<p>
Reform of the Catholic church began in Burgundy in
eastern France in 910 when Duke William of Aquitaine
founded the abbey of Cluny. The monastery began with a
renewed dedication to the highest spiritual ideals of the
Benedictine rule and was fortunate in possessing a series
of abbots in the tenth century who maintained these
ideals. Cluny was deliberately kept independent from
secular control. As Duke William stipulated in his original
charter, ‘‘It has pleased us also to insert in this document
that, from this day, those same monks there congregated
shall be subject neither to our yoke, nor to that of our
relatives, nor to the sway of the royal might, nor to that of
any earthly power.’’3
</p>

<p>
The Cluniac reform movement sparked an enthusiastic response, first in France and eventually in all of
western and central Europe. New monasteries were
founded on Cluniac ideals, and existing monasteries rededicated themselves by adopting the Cluniac program.
The movement also began to reach beyond monasticism
and into the papacy itself, which was in dire need of help.
</p>

<p>
Reform of the Papacy
</p>

<p>
By the eleventh century, church leaders realized the need
to free the church from the interference of lords in the
appointment of church officials. This issue of lay investiture, the practice by which secular rulers both chose and
invested their nominees to church offices with the symbols of their office, was dramatically taken up by the
greatest of the reform popes of the eleventh century,
Gregory VII (1073&#x2013;1085).
</p>

<p>
Elected pope in 1073, Gregory was convinced that he
had been chosen by God to reform the church. In pursuit
of those aims, Gregory claimed that he, as pope, was God’s
‘‘vicar on earth’’ and that the pope’s authority extended
over all Christians, including rulers. Gregory sought the
elimination of lay investiture. Only then could the church
regain its freedom, by which Gregory meant the right to
appoint its own clergy and run its own affairs. If rulers did
not accept these ‘‘divine’’ commands, they could be deposed by the pope in his capacity as the vicar of Christ.
</p>

<p>
Gregory VII soon found himself in conflict with
King Henry IV (1056&#x2013;1106) of Germany over these
claims. For many years, German kings had appointed
high-ranking clerics, especially bishops, as their vassals in
order to use them as administrators. Without them, the
king could not hope to maintain his own power vis-a`-vis
the powerful German nobles. In 1075, Pope Gregory
issued a decree forbidding important clerics from receiving their investiture from lay leaders: ‘‘We decree that
no one of the clergy shall receive the investiture with a
bishopric or abbey or church from the hand of an emperor or king or of any lay person.’’4 Henry had no intention of obeying a decree that challenged the very heart
of his administration.
</p>

<p>
The struggle between Henry IV and Gregory VII,
which is known as the Investiture Controversy, was one
of the great conflicts between church and state in the
High Middle Ages. It dragged on until 1122, when a new
German king and a new pope achieved a compromise in
the Concordat of Worms. Under this agreement, a bishop
in Germany was first elected by church officials. After
election, the nominee paid homage to the king as his lord,
who in turn invested him with the symbols of temporal
office. A representative of the pope then invested the new
bishop with the symbols of his spiritual office.
</p>

<p>
Christianity and Medieval
Civilization
</p>

<p>
Q Focus Questions: What were the characteristics of the
papal monarchy and the new religious orders of the
High Middle Ages, and what role did women play in
the religious life of the period? What was the church’s
attitude toward heretics and Jews during the High
Middle Ages?
</p>

<p>
Christianity was an integral part of the fabric of medieval
European society and the consciousness of Europe. Papal
directives affected the actions of kings and princes alike,
while Christian teaching and practices touched the economic, social, intellectual, cultural, and daily lives of all
Europeans.
</p>

<p>
Growth of the Papal Monarchy
</p>

<p>
The popes of the twelfth century did not abandon the reform ideals of Gregory VII, but they were less dogmatic
and more inclined to consolidate their power and build a
strong administrative system. By the twelfth century, the
Catholic church possessed a clearly organized hierarchical
structure. The pope and papal curia (staffed by high
church officials known as cardinals, the pope’s major advisers and administrators) were at the center of the administrative structure. Below them were the bishops; all of
Christendom was divided into dioceses under their direction. Archbishops were in principle more powerful than the
bishops, but at this time they were unable to exercise any
real control over the internal affairs of the bishops’ dioceses.
</p>

<p>
In the thirteenth century, the Catholic church reached
the height of its political, intellectual, and secular power.
The papal monarchy extended its sway over both ecclesiastical and temporal affairs, as was especially evident during the papacy of Pope Innocent III (1198&#x2013;1216). At the
beginning of his pontificate, in a letter to a priest, Innocent
made a clear statement of his views on papal supremacy:
</p>

<p>
As God, the creator of the universe, set two great lights in
the firmament of heaven, the greater light to rule the day,
and the lesser light to rule the night, so He set two great dignities in the firmament of the universal church, . . . the greater
to rule the day, that is, souls, and the lesser to rule the
night, that is, bodies. These dignities are the papal authority
and the royal power. And just as the moon gets her light
from the sun, and is inferior to the sun . . . so the royal power
gets the splendor of its dignity from the papal authority.
</p>

<p>
Innocent’s actions were those of a man who believed
that he, as pope, was the supreme judge of European affairs. He forced King Philip Augustus of France to take
back his wife and queen after Philip had tried to have the
marriage annulled. The pope intervened in German affairs
and installed his candidate as emperor. He compelled King
John of England to accept the papal choice for the position of archbishop of Canterbury. To achieve his political
ends, Innocent did not hesitate to use the spiritual
weapons at his command, especially the interdict, which
forbade priests to dispense the sacraments of the church
in the hope that the people, deprived of the comforts of
religion, would exert pressure against their ruler. Pope
Innocent’s interdict was so effective that it caused Philip to
restore his wife to her rightful place as queen of France.
</p>

<p>
New Religious Orders and Spiritual Ideals
</p>

<p>
In the second half of the eleventh century and the first
half of the twelfth, a wave of religious enthusiasm seized
Europe, leading to a spectacular growth in the number of
monasteries and the emergence of new monastic orders.
Most important was the Cistercian order, founded in
1098 by a group of monks dissatisfied with the lack of
strict discipline at their Benedictine monastery. Cistercian
monasticism spread rapidly from southern France into
the rest of Europe.
</p>

<p>
The Cistercians were strict. They ate a simple diet and
possessed only a single robe each. All decorations were
eliminated from their churches and monastic buildings.
More time for prayer and manual labor was provided by
shortening the number of hours spent at religious services.
The Cistercians played a major role in developing a new,
activist spiritual model for twelfth-century Europe. A
Benedictine monk often spent hours in prayer to honor
God; the Cistercian ideal had a different emphasis: ‘‘Arise,
soldier of Christ, arise! Get up off the ground and return
to the battle from which you have fled! Fight more boldly
after your flight, and triumph in glory!’’6 These were the
words of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux (1090&#x2013;1153), who
more than any other person embodied the new spiritual
ideal of Cistercian monasticism (see the box above).
</p>

<p>
Women in Religious Orders
</p>

<p>
Women were active participants in the spiritual movements of the age. The
number of women joining religious houses increased
perceptibly with the spread of the new orders of the
twelfth century. In the High Middle Ages, most nuns were
from the ranks of the landed aristocracy. Convents were
convenient for families unable or unwilling to find husbands for their daughters and for aristocratic women who
did not wish to marry. Female intellectuals found them a
haven for their activities. Most of the learned women of
the Middle Ages, especially in Germany, were nuns. One
of the most distinguished was Hildegard of Bingen
(1098&#x2013;1179), who became abbess of a convent at Disibodenberg in western Germany.
</p>

<p>
Hildegard shared in the religious enthusiasm of the
twelfth century. Soon after becoming abbess, she began to
write an account of the mystical visions she had experienced for years. ‘‘A great flash of light from heaven pierced
my brain and. . . in that instant my mind was imbued
with the meaning of the sacred books,’’7 she wrote in a
description typical of the world’s mystical literature.
Eventually, she produced three books based on her visions. Hildegard gained considerable renown as a mystic
and prophet, and popes, emperors, kings, dukes, and
bishops eagerly sought her advice.
</p>

<p>
Living the Gospel Life
</p>

<p>
In the thirteenth century, two
new religious orders emerged that had a profound impact
on the lives of ordinary people. The friars were particularly active in the cities, where, by their example, they
strove to provide a more personal religious experience.
Like their founder, Saint Francis of Assisi (1182&#x2013;1226),
the Franciscan friars lived among the people, preaching
repentance and aiding the poor. Their calls for a return to
the simplicity and poverty of the early church, reinforced
by their own example, were especially effective and made
them very popular.
</p>

<p>
The Dominicans arose out of the desire of a Spanish
priest, Dominic de Guzma´n (1170&#x2013;1221), to defend
church teachings from heresy. The spiritual revival of the
High Middle Ages had also led to the emergence of heretical movements, which became especially widespread
in southern France. Unlike Francis, Dominic was an intellectual who was appalled by the growth of heresy
within the church. He believed that a new religious order
of men who lived lives of poverty but were learned and
capable of preaching effectively would best be able to
attack heresy.
</p>

<p>
Monasticism and Social Services
</p>

<p>
Monastic life in all
of its different forms was the most important component
of religious life in the Middle Ages. Monks and nuns
performed a remarkable variety of tasks, including
praying for themselves and others, copying manuscripts,
maintaining libraries and schools, acting as missionaries
to the heathen, preaching to the poor, and fighting
heresy. But in an age unlike our own, when governments
provide basic social services, monks and nuns also
worked for society by providing a number of social
welfare services.
</p>

<p>
Monasteries often provided both
food and clothing for the poor. Otto of
Freising, a German writer of history in
the twelfth century, declared, ‘‘There is
always a pious, God-fearing friar sitting [at the gate] receiving all arriving
guests, pilgrims, and poor people, as
friendly and kind-hearted as Christ
himself.’’ Due to a shortage of inns,
monasteries also provided refuge for
pilgrims and other travelers. As the
Rule of Saint Benedict noted, ‘‘All who
arrive as guests are to be welcomed like
Christ.’’ Monks and nuns also took
care of the sick. They planted herb
gardens so that they could prepare the
plant remedies that were commonly
used in medieval medicine. In addition, monks and nuns ran hospitals,
especially for poor people who could
not receive care elsewhere. Unlike
modern-day hospitals, medieval hospitals were primarily residences for the
elderly, the terminally ill, or the blind. Separate quarters
were provided for lepers. There were about two thousand leper houses in France in the thirteenth century,
a good indication of the widespread nature of the
disease.
</p>

<p>
Popular Religion in the High Middle Ages
</p>

<p>
We have witnessed the actions of popes, bishops, and
monks. But what of ordinary clergy and laypeople? What
were their religious hopes and fears? What were their
spiritual aspirations?
</p>

<p>
The sacraments of the Catholic church ensured that
the church was an integral part of people’s lives, from
birth to death. There were (and still are) seven sacraments, administered only by the clergy. Sacraments&#x2014;such
as baptism and the Eucharist (the Lord’s Supper) were
viewed as outward symbols of an inward grace (grace was
God’s freely given gift that enabled humans to be saved)
and were considered imperative for a Christian’s salvation. Therefore, the clergy were seen to have a key role in
the attainment of salvation.
</p>

<p>
Other church practices were also important to ordinary people. Saints, it was believed, were men and women
who, through their holiness, had achieved a special position in heaven, enabling them to act as intercessors
before God. The saints’ ability to protect poor souls enabled them to take on great importance at the popular
level. Jesus’ apostles were recognized throughout Europe
as saints, but there were also numerous local saints who
had special significance. New cults developed rapidly,
particularly in the intense religious atmosphere of the
eleventh and twelfth centuries. The English introduced
Saint Nicholas, the patron saint of children, who remains
instantly recognizable today through his identification
with Santa Claus.
</p>

<p>
Of all the saints, the Virgin Mary occupied the
foremost position in the High Middle Ages. Mary was
viewed as the most important mediator with her son
Jesus, the judge of all sinners. Moreover, from the eleventh century on, a fascination with Mary as Jesus’ human
mother became more evident. A sign of Mary’s importance was the growing number of churches all over
Europe that were dedicated to her in the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries.
</p>

<p>
Emphasis on the role of the saints was closely tied to
the use of relics, which also increased noticeably in the
High Middle Ages. Relics were the bones of saints or
objects intimately connected to saints that were considered worthy of veneration by the faithful. A twelfthcentury English monk began his description of the abbey’s relics by saying, ‘‘There is kept there a thing more
precious than gold, . . . the right arm of St. Oswald. . . .
This we have seen with our own eyes and have kissed,
and have handled with our own hands. . . . There are
kept here also part of his ribs and of the soil on which he
fell.’’8 The monk went on to list additional relics possessed by the abbey, which purported to include two
pieces of Jesus’ swaddling clothes, pieces of Jesus’ manger, and part of the five loaves of bread with which Jesus
fed five thousand people. Because the holiness of the
saint was considered to be inherent in his relics, these
objects were believed to be capable of healing people or
producing other miracles.
</p>

<p>
Voices of Protest and Intolerance
</p>

<p>
The desire for more personal and deeper religious experience, which characterized the spiritual revival of the
High Middle Ages, also led people in directions hostile
to the institutional church. From the twelfth century on,
heresy&#x2014;the holding of religious doctrines different from
the orthodox teachings of the church as determined by
church authorities&#x2014;became a serious problem for the
Catholic church. The best-known heresy of the twelfth
and thirteenth centuries was Catharism. The Cathars
(from the Greek word for ‘‘pure’’) were also called Albigensians, after the city of Albi, one of their strongholds
in southern France. They believed in a dualist system in
which good and evil were separate and distinct. The
things of the spirit were good because they were created
by God, the source of light; the things of the world were
evil because they were created by Satan, the prince of
darkness. Humans, too, were enmeshed in dualism.
Their souls, which were good, were trapped in material
bodies, which were evil. According to the Cathars, the
Catholic church, itself a materialistic institution, had
nothing to do with God and was essentially evil. There
was no need to follow its teachings or recognize its authority. The Cathar movement gained valuable support
from important nobles in southern France and northern
Italy.
</p>

<p>
The spread of heresy in southern France alarmed the
church authorities. Pope Innocent III appealed to the
nobles of northern France for a Crusade (a military
campaign in defense of Christianity) against the heretics.
The Crusade against the Albigensians, which began in the
summer of 1209 and lasted for almost two decades, was a
bloody fight. Thousands of heretics (and innocents) were
slaughtered, including entire populations of some towns.
In Be´ziers, for example, seven thousand men, women,
and children were massacred when they took refuge in the
local church.
</p>

<p>
Southern France was devastated, but Catharism remained, which caused the Catholic church to devise a
regular method for discovering and dealing with heretics.
This led to the emergence of the Holy Office, as the papal
Inquisition was called, a formal court whose job it was to
ferret out and try heretics. Anyone accused of heresy who
refused to confess was considered guilty and was turned
over to the secular authorities for execution. To the
Christians of the thirteenth century, who believed that
there was only one path to salvation, heresy was a crime
against God and against humanity, and force was justified
to save souls from damnation. The fanaticism and fear
unleashed in the struggle against heretics were also used
against others, especially the Jews.
</p>

<p>
Persecution of the Jews
</p>

<p>
The Jews were the only religious minority in medieval Europe that was allowed to
practice a non-Christian religion. But the religious enthusiasm of the High Middle Ages produced an outburst
of intolerance against the supposed enemies of Christianity. After Crusades were launched against the Muslims
starting in 1096, European Christians took up the search
for enemies at home, persecuting Jews in France and the
Rhineland. Jews in Speyer, Worms, Mainz, and Cologne
were all set on by bands of Christian crusaders.
</p>

<p>
In the thirteenth century, in the supercharged atmosphere of fear created by the struggle with the heretics,
Jews were persecuted more and more (see the box on
p. 211). Friars urged action against these ‘‘murderers of
Christ,’’ contending that the Jews, having turned Jesus
over to the Roman authorities, were responsible for his
death, and organized the public burning of Jewish books.
The Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 decreed that Jews
must wear distinguishing marks, such as ribbons, yellow
badges, and special veils and cloaks, to differentiate
themselves from Christians. The same council encouraged
the development of Jewish ghettos, neighborhoods built
behind walled enclosures to isolate Jews from Christians.
The persecution and demonization of Jews stimulated a
tradition of anti-Semitism that proved to be one of
Christian Europe’s most insidious contributions to the
Western heritage.
</p>

<p>
European kings, who had portrayed themselves as
protectors of the Jews, had so fleeced the Jewish communities of their money by the end of the thirteenth century
that they no longer had reason to resist the mob fury.
Edward I expelled all Jews from England in 1290. The
French followed suit in 1306. As the policy of expulsion
spread into central Europe, most northern European Jews
were driven into Poland.
</p>

<p>
Intolerance and Homosexuality
</p>

<p>
The climate of intolerance that characterized thirteenth-century attitudes
toward Muslims, heretics, and Jews was also evident toward homosexuals. Although the church had condemned
homosexuality in the Early Middle Ages, it had not been
overly concerned with homosexual behavior, reflecting
the attitude prevalent in the secular world. But by the
thirteenth century, these tolerant attitudes had altered
drastically. Some historians connect this change to the
century’s climate of fear and intolerance against any
group that deviated from the standards of the now strictly
Catholic majority. A favorite approach of the critics was
to identify homosexuals with other detested groups.
Homosexuality was portrayed as a regular practice of
Muslims and such notorious heretics as the Albigensians.
Between 1250 and 1300, what had been tolerated in most
of Europe became a criminal act deserving of death.
</p>

<p>
The legislation against homosexuality commonly
referred to it as a ‘‘sin against nature.’’ This is precisely the
argument developed by Thomas Aquinas (see Chapter 9),
who formed Catholic opinion on the subject for centuries
to come. In his Summa Theologica, Aquinas argued that
because the purpose of sex was procreation, it could only
legitimately take place in ways that did not exclude
this possibility. Hence homosexuality (like all other sexual

to nature’’ and a deviation from the natural order established by God. This argument and laws prohibiting homosexual activity on pain of death remained the norm in
Europe until the twentieth century.

The Crusades
</p>

<p>
Q Focus Question: What were the reasons for the
Crusades, and who or what benefited the most from
the experience of the Crusades?
</p>

<p>
Another manifestation of the religious enthusiasm that
seized Europe in the High Middle Ages was the series of
Crusades mounted against the Muslims. These campaigns
gave the revived papacy of the High Middle Ages yet another opportunity to demonstrate its influence over European society. The Crusades were a curious mix of God
and warfare, two of the chief concerns of the Middle Ages.
</p>

<p>
Background to the Crusades
</p>

<p>
Although European civilization developed in relative isolation, it had never entirely lost contact with the lands and
empires to the east. At the end of the eleventh century, that
contactincreased,inpart becausedevelopmentsintheIslamic
and Byzantine worlds prompted the first major attempt of the
new European civilization to expand beyond Europe proper.
</p>

<p>
Islam and the Seljuk
</p>

<p>
Turks By the mid-tenth century,
the Islamic empire led by the Abbasid caliphate in
Baghdad was in the process of disintegration. A Shi’ite
dynasty known as the Fatimids managed to conquer
Egypt and establish the new city of Cairo as their capital.
In establishing a Shi’ite caliphate, they became rivals to
the Sunni caliphate of Baghdad, exacerbating the division
in the Islamic world. Nevertheless, the Fatimid dynasty
prospered and eventually surpassed the Abbasid caliphate
as the dynamic center of the Islamic world. The Fatimids
created a strong army by using nonnative peoples as
mercenaries. One of these peoples, the Seljuk Turks, soon
posed a threat to the Fatimids themselves.
</p>

<p>
The Seljuk Turks were a nomadic people from Central
Asia who had been converted to Islam and flourished as
military mercenaries for the Abbasid caliphate. Moving
gradually into Persia and Armenia, they grew in number
until by the eleventh century they were able to take over the
eastern provinces of the Abbasid empire. In 1055, a Turkish
leader captured Baghdad and assumed command of the
Abbasid empire with the title of sultan (‘‘holder of power’’).
By the second half of the eleventh century, the Seljuk Turks
were exerting military pressure on Egypt and the Byzantine
Empire. When the Byzantine emperor foolishly challenged
the Turks, the latter routed the Byzantine army at Manzikert
in 1071. In dire straits, the Byzantines turned to the west for
help, setting in motion the papal pleas that led to the
Crusades. To understand the complexities of the situation,
however, we need to look first at the Byzantine Empire.
</p>

<p>
The Byzantine Empire
</p>

<p>
The Macedonian dynasty of the
tenth and eleventh centuries had restored much of the
power of the Byzantine Empire; its incompetent successors, however, reversed most of the gains. After the Macedonian dynasty was extinguished in 1056, the empire was
beset by internal struggles for power between ambitious
military leaders and aristocratic families who attempted to
buy the support of the great landowners of Anatolia by
allowing them greater control over their peasants.
</p>

<p>
The growing division between the Catholic church of
the west and the Eastern Orthodox church of the Byzantine Empire also weakened the Byzantine state. The
Eastern Orthodox church was unwilling to accept the
pope’s claim that he was the sole head of the church. This
issue reached a climax when Pope Leo IX and the Patriarch Michael Cerularius, head of the Byzantine church,
formally excommunicated each other in 1054, initiating a
schism between the two great branches of Christianity
that has not been healed to this day.
</p>

<p>
The Byzantine Empire faced external threats to its
security as well. The greatest challenge came from the
Seljuk Turks who had moved into Asia Minor, the
heartland of the empire and its main source of food and
manpower. After defeating Byzantine forces in 1071, the
Turks advanced into Anatolia, where many peasants, already disgusted by their exploitation at the hands of
Byzantine landowners, readily accepted Turkish control.
</p>

<p>
Another dynasty, however, soon breathed new life
into the Byzantine Empire. The Comneni, under Alexius I
Comnenus (1081&#x2013;1118), were victorious on the Greek
Adriatic coast against the Normans, defeated the Pechenegs in the Balkans, and stopped the Turks in Anatolia.
Lacking the resources to undertake additional campaigns
against the Turks, Emperor Alexius I turned to the west
for military assistance. It was the positive response of the
west to the emperor’s request that led to the Crusades.
</p>

<p>
The Early Crusades
</p>

<p>
The Crusades were based on the idea of a holy war against
the ‘‘infidel,’’ or unbeliever. The wrath of Christians was
directed against the Muslims and had already found some
expression in the attempt to reconquer Spain from the
Muslims. At the end of the eleventh century, Christian
Europe found itself with a glorious opportunity to attack
the Muslims.
</p>

<p>
The immediate impetus for the Crusades came when
the Byzantine emperor, Alexius I, asked Pope Urban II
(1088&#x2013;1099) for help against the Seljuk Turks. The pope
saw a golden opportunity to provide papal leadership for a
great cause: to rally the warriors of Europe for the liberation
of Jerusalem and the Holy Land from the Muslim infidel. At
the Council of Clermont in southern France near the end of
1095, Urban challenged Christians to take up their weapons
against the infidel and join in a holy war to recover the Holy
Land. The pope promised remission of sins: ‘‘All who die by
the way, whether by land or by sea, or in battle against the
pagans, shall have immediate remission of sins. This I grant
them through the power of God with which I am invested.’’
</p>

<p>
The initial response to Urban’s speech reveals how
appealing many people found this combined call to military arms and religious fervor. A self-appointed leader,
Peter the Hermit, who preached of his visions of the Holy
City of Jerusalem, convinced a large mob, most of them
poor and many of them peasants, to undertake a Crusade
to the east. One person who encountered Peter described
him in these words: ‘‘Outdoors he wore a woolen tunic,
which revealed his ankles, and above it a hood; he wore a
cloak to cover his upper body, a bit of his arms, but his feet
were bare. He drank wine and ate fish, but scarcely ever ate
bread. This man, partly because of his reputation, partly
because of his preaching, [assembled] a very large army.’’10
</p>

<p>
This so-called Peasants’ Crusade or Crusade of the
Poor comprised a ragtag rabble that moved through the
Balkans, terrorizing natives and looting for their food and
supplies. Their misplaced religious enthusiasm led to another tragic by-product as well, the persecution of the
Jews, long depicted by the church as the murderers of
Christ. As a contemporary chronicler described it, ‘‘They
persecuted the hated race of the Jews wherever they were
found.’’ Two bands of peasant crusaders, led by Peter the
Hermit, managed to reach Constantinople. Emperor
Alexis wisely shipped them over to Asia Minor, where the
Turks massacred the undisciplined and poorly armed mob.
</p>

<p>
The First Crusade
</p>

<p>
Pope Urban II did not share the
wishful thinking of the peasant crusaders but was more
inclined to trust knights who had been well-trained in
the art of war. The warriors of western Europe, particularly France, formed the first ‘‘official’’ crusading armies. The knights who made up this crusading host were
motivated by religious fervor, but there were other
attractions as well. Some sought adventure and welcomed a legitimate opportunity to pursue their favorite
pastime&#x2014;fighting. Others saw an opportunity to gain territory, riches, status, possibly a title, and even salvation&#x2014;
had the pope not offered a full remission of sins for
those who participated in these ‘‘armed pilgrimages’’?
From the perspective of the pope and European monarchs, the Crusades offered a way to rid Europe of
contentious young nobles who disturbed the peace and
wasted lives and energy fighting each other. And merchants in many Italian cities relished the prospect of new
trading opportunities in Muslim lands.
</p>

<p>
In the First Crusade, launched in 1096, three organized bands of noble warriors, most of them French, made
their way to the east (see Map 10.5). This first crusading
army probably numbered several thousand cavalry and as
many as ten thousand foot soldiers. After the capture of
Antioch in 1098, much of the crusading host proceeded
down the coast of Palestine, evading the garrisoned coastal
cities, and reached Jerusalem in June 1099. After a fiveweek siege, the Holy City was taken amid a horrible
massacre of the inhabitants, men, women, and children
(see the box above).
</p>

<p>
After further conquest of Palestinian lands, the crusaders ignored the wishes of the Byzantine emperor (who
foolishly believed the crusaders were working on his behalf) and organized four Crusader States (Edessa, Antioch,
Tripoli, and Jerusalem). Because the Crusader States were
surrounded by Muslim enemies, they grew increasingly
dependent on the Italian commercial cities for supplies
from Europe. Some Italian cities, such as Genoa, Pisa,
and especially Venice, became rich and powerful in the
process.
</p>

<p>
The Second Crusade
</p>

<p>
The Crusader States had a hard
time maintaining themselves. Already by the 1120s, the
Muslims had begun to strike back. In 1144, Edessa became the first of the four Latin states to be recaptured. Its
fall led to renewed calls for another Crusade, especially
from the monastic firebrand Saint Bernard of Clairvaux,
who exclaimed, ‘‘Now, on account of our sins, the sacrilegious enemies of the cross have begun to show their
faces. . . . What are you doing, you servants of the cross?
Will you throw to the dogs that which is most holy? Will
you cast pearls before swine?’’11 Bernard aimed his message at knights and even managed to enlist two powerful
rulers, King Louis VII of France and Emperor Conrad III
of Germany. Their Second Crusade, however, proved a
total failure.
</p>

<p>
The Third Crusade
</p>

<p>
The Third Crusade was a reaction to
the fall of the Holy City of Jerusalem in 1187 to Muslim
forces under Saladin. Now all of Christendom was ablaze
with calls for a new Crusade in the east. Three major
monarchs agreed to lead new crusading forces in person:
Emperor Frederick Barbarossa of Germany (1152&#x2013;1190),
Richard I the Lionhearted of England (1189&#x2013;1199), and
Philip II Augustus, king of France (1180&#x2013;1223). The crusaders, who finally arrived in the east in 1189, encountered
nothing but problems. Frederick Barbarossa drowned
while swimming in a local river, and his army quickly fell
apart. The English and French arrived by sea and met with
success against the coastal cities, where they had the support of their fleets, but when they moved inland, they
failed miserably. Eventually, after Philip went home,
Richard negotiated a settlement whereby Saladin agreed to
allow Christian pilgrims free access to Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
The Crusades of the Thirteenth Century
</p>

<p>
After the death of Saladin in 1193, Pope Innocent III
initiated the Fourth Crusade. On its way to the east,
the crusading army became involved in a dispute over
the succession to the Byzantine throne. The Venetian
leaders of the Fourth Crusade saw an opportunity to
neutralize their greatest commercial competitor, the
Byzantine Empire. Diverted to Constantinople, the
crusaders sacked that great capital city in 1204 and declared the new Latin Empire of Constantinople. Not
until 1261 did a Byzantine army recapture Constantinople. The Byzantine Empire had been saved, but
it was no longer a great Mediterranean power. The restored empire now consisted only of the city of Constantinople and its surrounding territory along with
some lands in Asia Minor. Though reduced in size, the
empire limped along for another 190 years until its
weakened condition finally enabled the Ottoman Turks
to conquer it in 1453.
</p>

<p>
Despite the failures, the crusading ideal was not yet
completely lost. In Germany in 1212, a youth known as
Nicholas of Cologne announced that God had inspired
him to lead a Children’s Crusade to the Holy Land.
Thousands of young people joined Nicholas and made
their way down the Rhine and across the Alps to Italy,
where the pope told them to go home. Most tried to do
so. At about the same time, a group of about twenty
thousand French children, also inspired by the desire to
free the Holy Land from the Muslims, made their way to
Marseilles, where two shipowners agreed to transport
them to the Holy Land. Seven ships packed with hymnsinging youths soon left the port. Two of the ships sank in
a storm near Sardinia; the other five sailed to North
Africa, where the children were sold into slavery.
</p>

<p>
Four more Crusades of adult warriors over the next
half-century were no more successful. Finally, Europe’s
Christians grudgingly accepted that they were not to be
the guardians of the the Holy Land.
</p>

<p>
Effects of the Crusades
</p>

<p>
Whether the Crusades had much effect on European
civilization is debatable. The crusaders made little longterm impact in Asia Minor and the Middle East, where
the only visible remnants of their conquests were the
castles they erected. Some broadening of perspective may
have come from the exchange between cultures, but the
interaction of Christian Europe with the Muslim world
was actually both more intense and more meaningful in
Spain and Sicily than in the Holy Land.
</p>

<p>
Did the Crusades help stabilize European society by
removing large numbers of young warriors who would
have fought each other in Europe? Some historians think
so and believe that western monarchs established their
control more easily as a result. There is no doubt that
the Italian seaports, especially Genoa, Pisa, and Venice,
benefited economically from the Crusades, but even
without them, Italian merchants would have pursued new
trade contacts with the world to the east.
</p>

<p>
The Crusades did, however, have unfortunate side effects that would afflict European society for generations. The
first widespread attacks on the Jews occurred during the
Crusades. Some Christians argued that to undertake holy
wars againstMuslimswhilethe ‘‘murderers of Christ’’ranfree
at home was unthinkable. From that time on, the massacre of
Jews became a regular feature of medieval European life.
</p>

<p>
CONCLUSION
</p>

<p>
The period from 1000 to 1300 was a dynamic time in the
development of Western civilization. The nobles, whose warlike
attitudes were rationalized by labeling themselves the defenders of
Christian society, continued to dominate the medieval world
politically, economically, and socially. But kings gradually began
to expand their powers. Although the popes sometimes treated
rulers condescendingly, by the thirteenth century, the monarchs
were developing the machinery of government that would enable
them to challenge exalted claims of papal power and assume
political authority in Europe. The actions of these medieval
monarchs laid the foundation for the European kingdoms that in
one form or another have dominated the European political scene
ever since.
</p>

<p>
The Catholic church shared in the challenge of new growth by
reforming itself and striking out on a path toward greater papal
power, both within the church and over European society. The High
Middle Ages witnessed a spiritual renewal that led to numerous and
even divergent paths: revived papal leadership, the development
of centralized administrative machinery that buttressed papal
authority, and new dimensions to the religious life of the clergy and
laity. At the same time, this spiritual renewal also gave rise to the
crusading ‘‘holy warrior’’ who killed for God, which created an
animosity between Christians and Muslims that still has repercussions to this day.
</p>

<p>
The religious enthusiasm of the twelfth century continued well
into the thirteenth as new orders of friars gave witness to spiritual
growth and passion, but underneath lay seeds of discontent and
change. Dissent from church teaching and practices grew, leading to
a climate of fear and intolerance as the church responded with
inquisitorial procedures to enforce conformity to its teachings. At
the same time, papal claims of supremacy over secular authorities
were increasingly challenged by the rising power of monarchical
authorities, who, because of the growth of cities, the revival of trade,
and the emergence of a money economy, were now able to hire
soldiers and officials to carry out their wishes.
</p>

<p>
The High Middle Ages of the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth
centuries had been a period of great innovation, evident in
significant economic, social, political, religious, intellectual, and
cultural changes. And yet by the end of the thirteenth century,
certain tensions had begun to creep into European society. As we
shall see in the next chapter, these tensions would soon bring a
torrent of troubles.
