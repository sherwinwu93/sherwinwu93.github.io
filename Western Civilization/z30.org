BY 1985, AFTER FOUR DECADES of the Cold War, Westerners had become accustomed to a division of Europe between
West and East that seemed to be permanent. A prosperous Western
Europe allied with the United States stood opposed to a still-struggling
Eastern Europe that remained largely subject to the Soviet Union.
The division of Germany symbolized the new and seemingly wellestablished order. Yet in just a few years, a revolutionary upheaval in
the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe brought an end to the Cold
War and to the division of postwar Europe. Even the Soviet Union
ceased to exist as a nation. And much of this can be traced to the
reform efforts of one man, Mikhail Gorbachev.
On August 19, 1991, a group of Soviet leaders opposed to reform arrested Gorbachev, the president of the Soviet Union, and
tried to seize control of the government. Spontaneously, hundreds of
thousands of Russians, led by Boris Yeltsin, poured into the streets
of Moscow and Leningrad to protest the attempted coup. Some
army units, sent out to enforce the wishes of the upstart leaders,
defected to Yeltsin’s side, and within days, the usurpers were forced
to surrender. This failed attempt to seize power had unexpected
results as Russia and many of the other Soviet republics turned
their backs on the government and declared their independence.
By the end of 1991, the Soviet Union---one of the largest empires in
world history---had come to an astonishingly swift end, and a new
era of cooperation between the successor states of the old Soviet
Union and the nations of the West had begun.
As the world adjusted to the transformation from Cold War to
post--Cold War sensibilities, other changes shaped the Western outlook. The demographic face of European countries changed as massive numbers of immigrants created more ethnically diverse
populations. New artistic and intellectual currents, the continued
advance of science and technology, the emergence of the Digital
Age, the surge of the women’s liberation movement---all spoke of a
vibrant, ever-changing world. At the same time, a devastating terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in New York City and the
Pentagon outside Washington, D.C., in 2001 made the Western
world vividly aware of its vulnerability to international terrorism.
But most important of all, Western nations, like all nations on the
planet, had become acutely aware of the political and economic interdependence of the world’s nations and the global nature of the
challenges of the twenty-first century.

Toward a New Western Order
Q Focus Questions: What reforms did Gorbachev
institute in the Soviet Union, and what role did he
play in the country’s demise? What major political
developments have occurred in Eastern Europe,
Western Europe, and North America since 1985?
Between 1945 and 1985, a new political order following
the devastation of World War II had left the Western
world divided between a prosperous, capitalistic West and
an impoverished, Communist East. But in the late 1980s
and early 1990s, the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellite states underwent a revolutionary upheaval
that dramatically altered the European landscape (see
Map 30.1) and left many Europeans with both new hopes
and new fears.
The Revolutionary Era in the Soviet Union
By 1980, it was becoming apparent to a small number of
reformers in the Communist Party that the Soviet Union
was seriously ailing. When one of these young reformers,
Mikhail Gorbachev, was chosen as Party secretary in March
1985, a new era began in the Soviet Union.
The Gorbachev Era After receiving his law degree at the
University of Moscow in 1955, Mikhail Gorbachev returned
to his native southern Russia, where he eventually became
first secretary of the Communist Party in the city of Stavropol (he had joined the Party in 1952). In 1980, Gorbachev became a full member of the ruling Politburo and
secretary of the Central Committee. In March 1985, Party
leaders elected him general secretary of the Party, and he
became the new leader of the Soviet Union.
Educated during the years of reform under Khrushchev, Gorbachev seemed intent on taking earlier reforms
to their logical conclusions. He had said to his wife on
achieving power, ‘‘We cannot go on living like this.’’1 By the
1980s, Soviet economic problems were obvious. Rigid,
centralized planning had led to mismanagement and stifled
innovation. Although the Soviets still excelled in space exploration, they had fallen behind the West in high technology, especially in the development and production of
computers for private and public use. Most noticeable to the
Soviet people was the decline in the standard of living. From
the start, Gorbachev preached the need for radical reforms.
The cornerstone of Gorbachev’s radical reforms was
perestroika, or ‘‘restructuring’’ (see the box on p. 654).
At first, this meant only a reordering of economic policy
as Gorbachev called for the beginning of a market
economy with limited free enterprise and some private
property. Gorbachev soon perceived, however, that in
the Soviet system, the economic sphere was intimately
tied to the social and political spheres. Attempting to
reform the economy without political or social reform
would be doomed to failure. One of the most important
instruments of perestroika was glasnost, or ‘‘openness.’’
Soviet citizens and officials were encouraged to discuss
openly the strengths and weaknesses of the Soviet Union. Pravda, the official newspaper of the Communist
Party, began for the first time to include reports of official
corruption, sloppy factory work, and protests against
government policy.
Political reforms were equally revolutionary. At the
Communist Party conference in 1988, Gorbachev called
for the creation of a new Soviet parliament, the Congress
of People’s Deputies, whose members were to be chosen in
competitive elections. It convened in 1989, the first such
meeting in Russia since 1918. Early in 1990, Gorbachev
legalized the formation of other political parties and struck
Article 6, which had guaranteed the ‘‘leading role’’ of the
Communist Party, from the Soviet constitution. At the
same time, Gorbachev attempted to consolidate his power
by creating a new state presidency. Hitherto, the position
of first secretary of the Party had been the most important
post in the Soviet Union, but as the Communist Party
became less closely associated with the state, the powers of
this office diminished correspondingly. In March 1990,
Gorbachev became the Soviet Union’s first president.
One of Gorbachev’s most serious problems stemmed
from the nature of the nation he led. The Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics was a truly multiethnic country, containing 92 nationalities and 112 recognized languages.
Previously, the iron hand of the Communist Party, centered in Moscow, had kept a lid on the centuries-old
ethnic tensions that had periodically erupted. As Gorbachev released this iron grip, tensions resurfaced, a byproduct of glasnost that Gorbachev had not anticipated.
Ethnic groups took advantage of the new openness to
protest what they perceived as ethnically motivated
slights. When violence erupted, the Soviet army, in disrepair since its ill-fated decadelong foray into Afghanistan, had difficulty controlling the situation.
The years 1988 to 1990 also witnessed the appearance of nationalist movements in the republics that
made up the Soviet Union. Many were motivated
by ethnic concerns, with calls for sovereignty and
independence from Russian-based rule centered in
Moscow. These movements sprang up first in Georgia
in late 1988 and then in Latvia, Estonia, Moldavia,
Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, and Lithuania. On March 11,
1990, the Lithuanian Supreme Council proclaimed
Lithuania an independent state.
The End of the Soviet Union During 1990 and 1991,
Gorbachev struggled to deal with Lithuania and the
other problems unleashed by his reforms. On the one
hand, he tried to appease conservatives who complained
about the growing disorder within the Soviet Union. On
the other hand, he tried to accommodate the liberal
forces, especially those in the Soviet republics, who
increasingly favored a new kind of decentralized
Soviet federation. In particular, Gorbachev labored to
cooperate more closely with Boris Yeltsin (1931--2007),
who had been elected president of the Russian Republic
in June 1991.
By 1991, the conservative leaders of the traditional
Soviet institutions---the army, government, KGB, and
military industries---had grown increasingly worried
about the impending dissolution of the Soviet Union
and its impact on their own fortunes. On August 19,
1991, a group of these discontented rightists arrested
Gorbachev and attempted to seize power. Gorbachev’s
unwillingness to work with the conspirators and the
brave resistance in Moscow of Yeltsin and thousands of
Russians who had grown accustomed to their new liberties caused the coup to disintegrate rapidly. The actions of these right-wing plotters, however, served to
accelerate the very process they had hoped to stop---the
disintegration of the Soviet Union.
Despite desperate pleas by Gorbachev, the Soviet
republics soon moved for complete independence. Ukraine voted for independence on December 1, 1991, and
a week later, the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus
announced that the Soviet Union had ‘‘ceased to exist.’’
Gorbachev resigned on December 25, 1991, and turned
over his responsibilities as commander in chief to Boris
Yeltsin, the president of Russia. By the end of 1991, one of
the largest empires in world history had evaporated, and a
new era had begun in its lands.
The New Russia A new power struggle soon ensued
within Russia, by far the largest of the former Soviet republics. Yeltsin was committed to introducing a free
market economy as quickly as possible, but the transition
was not easy. Economic hardships and social disarray,
made worse by a dramatic rise in the activities of organized crime mobs, led increasing numbers of Russians to
support both former Communists and hard-line nationalists, who criticized Russia’s loss of prestige in world
affairs.
During the mid-1990s, Yeltsin sought to implement
reforms that would set Russia on a firm course toward a
pluralistic political system and a market economy. But the
new post-Communist Russia remained as fragile as ever.
A nagging war in the Caucasus---where the Muslim people
of Chechnya sought national independence from Russia---
drained the government’s budget and exposed the decrepit state of the once vaunted Red Army. Yeltsin won
reelection as president in 1996, although his precarious
health raised serious questions about his ability to govern.
The Putin Era At the end of 1999, Yeltsin suddenly
resigned and was replaced by Vladimir Putin (b. 1952), a
former member of the KGB. Putin vowed to strengthen
the role of the central government in managing the affairs
of state. During the succeeding months, the parliament
approved his proposal to centralize power in the hands of
the federal government in Moscow.
Putin also vowed to return the breakaway state of
Chechnya to Russian authority and to adopt a more
assertive role in international affairs. Fighting in
Chechnya continued
throughout 2000,
nearly reducing the
republic’s capital city
of Grozny to ruins.
In July 2001, Putin
launched reforms,
which included the
unrestricted sale and
purchase of land and
tax cuts aimed at
boosting economic
growth and budget
revenues. Although
Russia soon experienced a budget surplus and a growing economy, serious
problems remained.
President Putin attempted to deal with the chronic
problems in Russian society by centralizing his control
over the system and by silencing critics---notably in the
Russian media. Although Putin was criticized in the West
for these moves, many Russians expressed sympathy with
Putin’s attempts to restore a sense of pride and discipline
in Russian society.
In 2008, Dmitry Medvedev became president of
Russia when Putin could not run for reelection under
Russia’s constitution. Instead, Putin became prime minister, and the two men have since shared power.
Eastern Europe: The Revolutions of 1989
and the Collapse of the Communist Order
Stalin’s postwar order had imposed Communist regimes
throughout Eastern Europe. The process of sovietization
seemed so complete that few people believed that the
new order could be undone. But discontent with their
Soviet-style regimes always simmered beneath the surface of these satellite states, and after Mikhail Gorbachev
made it clear that his government would not intervene
militarily, the Communist regimes fell quickly in the
revolutions of 1989.
The Fall Martial law had not solved Poland’s problems
after it had been imposed in 1981, and in 1988, new
demonstrations led the Polish regime to agree to hold
parliamentary elections---the first free elections in Eastern
Europe in forty years. Bowing to the inevitable, the military regime allowed the newly elected Solidarity coalition
to form a new government, thus ending forty-five years of
Communist rule. In December 1990, Lech Walesa, the
head of Solidarity, was elected president of Poland.
In Hungary, the economy had sagged by the late
1980s, and in 1989, the Communist regime, aware of
growing dissatisfaction, began to undertake reforms. But
they came too late as new political parties called for
Hungary to become a democratic republic. After elections
in March 1990, a new coalition government was formed
that committed Hungary to democratic government.
Czechoslovakia, too, found a peaceful way to a new
political system. Government attempts to suppress mass
demonstrations in Prague and other cities in 1988 and
1989 only led to more and larger demonstrations. In
December 1989, as protest continued, the Communist
government, lacking any real support, collapsed. President Gustav Husa´k resigned and at the end of December
was replaced by Va´clav Havel (b. 1936), a dissident
playwright who had played an important role in bringing
the Communist government down. Havel set out on a
goodwill tour to various Western countries, where he
proved to be an eloquent spokesman for Czech democracy and a new order in Europe (see the box on p. 656).
Czechoslovakia’s revolutionary path was considerably
less violent than Romania’s, where opposition grew as the
dictator Nicolae Ceaus ¸escu rejected the reforms in Eastern
Europe promoted by Gorbachev. Ceaus ¸escu’s extreme
measures to reduce Romania’s external debt led to economic difficulties and angered many Romanians. A small
incident became the spark that ignited heretofore suppressed flames of discontent. The ruthless crushing of a
demonstration in Timisoara in December 1989 led to
other mass demonstrations. After the dictator was booed
at a mass rally on December 21, the army refused to
support any more repression. Ceaus ¸escu and his wife were
captured on December 22 and tried and executed on
Christmas Day. Leadership now passed into the hands of
the hastily formed National Salvation Front.
After the Fall The fall of Communist governments in
Eastern Europe during the revolutions of 1989 brought a
wave of euphoria to Europe. The new structures meant an
end to a postwar European order that had been imposed on
unwilling peoples by the victorious forces of the Soviet
Union. In 1989 and 1990, new governments throughout
Eastern Europe worked diligently to scrap the remnants of
the old system and introduce the democratic procedures and
market systems they believed would revitalize their scarred
lands. But this process proved to be neither simple nor easy.
Most Eastern European countries had little, if any,
experience with democratic systems. And ethnic divisions,
which had troubled these areas before World War II and
had been forcibly submerged under Communist rule, reemerged with a vengeance. Finally, the rapid conversion to
market economies proved painful, and the adoption of
austerity measures caused much suffering. Unemployment,
for example, climbed to over 13 percent in Poland in 1992.
Nevertheless, by the beginning of the twenty-first
century, many of these states were making a successful
transition to both free markets and democracy.
In Poland, Aleksander Kwasniewski (b. 1954), although a
former Communist, was elected president in November
1995 and pushed Poland toward an increasingly prosperous free market economy. Current president Lech
Kaczynski (b. 1949) is emphasizing the need to combine
modernization with tradition. In Czechoslovakia, the
shift to non-Communist rule was complicated by old
problems, especially ethnic issues. Czechs and Slovaks
disagreed over the makeup of the new state but were
able to agree to a peaceful division of the country. On
January 1, 1993, Czechoslovakia split into the Czech
Republic and Slovakia. Va´clav Havel was elected the first
president of the new Czech Republic. In Romania, the
current president, Traian Ba Csescu (b. 1951), leads a
country that is just beginning to show economic growth
and the rise of a middle class.
The revival of the post--Cold War Eastern European
states is evident in their desire to join both NATO and the
European Union (EU), the two major Cold War institutions
of Western European unity. In 1997, Poland, the Czech
Republic, and Hungary became full members of NATO. In
2004, ten nations---including Hungary, Poland, the Czech
Republic, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania---joined
the EU, and Romania and Bulgaria joined in 2007.
The Reunification of Germany
Perhaps the most dramatic events took place in East
Germany, where a persistent economic slump and the ongoing oppressiveness of the regime of Erich Honecker led to
a flight of refugees and mass demonstrations against the
regime in the summer and fall of 1989. After more than half
a million people flooded the streets of East Berlin on
November 4, shouting, ‘‘The wall must go!’’ the German
Communist government soon capitulated to popular
pressure and on November 9 opened the entire border with
the West. The Berlin Wall, long a symbol of the Cold War,
became the site of massive celebrations as thousands of
people used sledgehammers to tear it down. By December,
new political parties had emerged, and on March 18, 1990,
in East Germany’s first free elections ever, the Christian
Democrats won almost 50 percent of the vote. After months
of political negotiations between West and East German
officials as well as the original four postwar occupying
powers (the United States, Great Britain, France, and the
Soviet Union), political reunification was achieved on
October 3, 1990. What had seemed almost impossible at the
beginning of 1989 had become a reality by the end of 1990.
The Disintegration of Yugoslavia
From its formation in 1918 as the Kingdom of the Serbs,
Croats, and Slovenes, Yugoslavia had been an artificial
creation. After World War II, the dictatorial Marshal Tito
had managed to hold the nation’s six republics and two
autonomous provinces together. After his death in 1980,
no strong leader emerged, and his responsibilities passed to
a collective state presidency and the League of Communists
of Yugoslavia. At the end of the 1980s, Yugoslavia was
caught up in the reform movements sweeping through
Eastern Europe. The League of Communists collapsed, and
new parties quickly emerged.
In 1990, the republics of Slovenia, Croatia, BosniaHerzegovina, and Macedonia began to lobby for a new
federal structure of Yugoslavia that would fulfill their
separatist desires. Slobodan Milosˇevic (1941--2006), who
had become the leader of the Serbian Communist Party in
1987 and had managed to stay in power by emphasizing
his Serbian nationalism, rejected these efforts. He asserted
that these republics could be independent only if new
border arrangements were made to accommodate the Serb
minorities in those republics who did not want to live
outside the boundaries of a Greater Serbian state. Serbs
constituted 11.6 percent of Croatia’s population and
32 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina’s in 1981.
After negotiations among the six republics failed,
Slovenia and Croatia declared their independence in June
1991. Milosˇevic’s government sent the Yugoslavian army,
which it controlled, into Slovenia, without much success.
In September 1991, it began a full assault against Croatia.
Increasingly, the Yugoslavian army was becoming the
Serbian army. Before a cease-fire was arranged, the Serbian
forces had captured one-third of Croatia’s territory in
brutal and destructive fighting.
The War in Bosnia The recognition of independent
Slovenia, Croatia, and then Bosnia-Herzegovina by many
European states and the United States early in 1992 did
not stop the Serbs from turning their guns on Bosnia. By
mid-1993, Serbian forces had occupied 70 percent of
Bosnian territory (see the box above). The Serbian policy
of ‘‘ethnic cleansing’’---killing or forcibly removing Bosnian Muslims from their lands---revived memories of
Nazi atrocities during World War II. This account by one
Muslim survivor from the town of Srebrenica is eerily
reminiscent of the activities of the Nazi Einsatzgruppen
(see Chapter 27):
When the truck stopped, they told us to get off in groups of
five. We immediately heard shooting next to the trucks. . . .
About ten Serbs with automatic rifles told us to lie down on
the ground face first. As we were getting down, they started
to shoot, and I fell into a pile of corpses. I felt hot liquid
running down my face. I realized that I was only grazed. As
they continued to shoot more groups, I kept on squeezing
myself in between dead bodies.2
Almost eight thousand men and boys were killed in
the Serbian massacre at Srebrenica. Nevertheless, despite
worldwide outrage, European governments failed to take
a decisive and forceful stand against these Serbian activities. By 1995, some 250,000 Bosnians (mostly civilians)
had been killed, and 2 million others were left homeless.
Renewed offensives by mostly Muslim Bosnian government army forces and by the Croatian army regained
considerable territory that had been lost to Serbian forces.
Air strikes by NATO bombers, strongly advocated by
U.S. President Bill Clinton, were launched in retaliation
for Serb attacks on civilians and weakened the Serb
military positions. A formal peace treaty was signed in
Paris on December 14 that split Bosnia into a loose union
of a Serb republic (with 49 percent of the land) and a
Muslim-Croat federation (with 51 percent of the land).
NATO agreed to send a force of sixty thousand troops
(twenty thousand American troops made up the largest
single contingent) that would monitor the frontier between the new political entities (see Map 30.2).
The War in Kosovo Peace in Bosnia, however, did not
bring peace to the remnants of Yugoslavia. A new war
erupted in 1999 over Kosovo, which had been granted the
status of an autonomous province within Yugoslavia in
1974. Kosovo’s inhabitants were mainly ethnic Albanians.
But Kosovo also had a Serbian minority who considered
Kosovo a sacred territory because it contained the site
where Serbian forces had been defeated by the Ottoman
Turks in the fourteenth century in a battle that became a
defining moment in Serbian history.
In 1989, Yugoslav president Milosˇevic stripped Kosovo
of its autonomous status and outlawed any official use
of the Albanian language. In 1993, some groups of ethnic
Albanians founded the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA)
and began a campaign against Serbian rule in Kosovo.
When Serb forces began to massacre ethnic Albanians in an
effort to crush the KLA, the United States and its NATO
allies sought to arrange a settlement. After months of negotiations, the Kosovo Albanians agreed to a peace plan
that would have given the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
broad autonomy for a three-year interim period. When
Milosˇevic refused to sign the agreement, the United States
and its NATO allies began a bombing campaign that forced
the Yugoslavian government into compliance.
The Aftermath By 2000, the Serbian people had finally
tired of the violence and in the fall elections ousted
Milosˇevic from power. The new Serbian government under
Vojislav Kostunica (b. 1944) moved quickly to cooperate
with the international community and begin rebuilding
the Serbian economy. On June 28, 2001, the Serbian
government agreed to allow Milosˇevic to be put on trial by
an international tribunal for crimes against humanity for
his ethnic cleansing policies throughout Yugoslavia’s disintegration. He died in 2006 during that trial.
The fate of Bosnia has not yet been finally determined. In Bosnia, thirty thousand NATO troops remain,
trying to keep the peace between the Serb republic and
the Muslim-Croat federation. More than thirty international organizations are at work rebuilding schools, roads,
and sewers, but only the presence of NATO troops keeps
old hatreds from erupting again.
In Kosovo, NATO military forces were brought in to
maintain an uneasy peace, while United Nations officials
worked to create democratic institutions and the European Union provided funds for rebuilding the region’s
infrastructure. These efforts are ongoing but are made
difficult by the festering hatred between Kosovo Albanians and the remaining Serbs.
The last political vestiges of Yugoslavia ceased to exist
in 2004 when the Kostunica government officially renamed the truncated country ‘‘Serbia and Montenegro.’’
Two years later, Montenegrans voted in favor of independence, and in 2008, Kosovo declared independence
as well. Thus ninety years after Yugoslavia was cobbled
together, all six of its constituent republics (Slovenia,
Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, Macedonia, and
Montenegro) were once again independent nations, and a
new one (Kosovo) had been born.
Western Europe and the Search for Unity
With the revolutions of 1989, Western Europe faced new
political possibilities and challenges. Germany was once
again united, delighting the Germans but frightening
their neighbors. At the same time, new opportunities for
thinking of all of Europe as a political entity also
emerged. Eastern Europe was no longer sealed off from
Western Europe by the Iron Curtain of the Cold War.
Germany Restored In the mid-1980s, West German
chancellor Helmut Kohl had benefited greatly from an
economic boom. Gradually, however, discontent with the
Christian Democrats increased, and by 1988, their political
prospects seemed diminished. But the 1989 revolution in
East Germany led to the swift and unexpected reunification of the two Germanies, making the new German nation, with 79 million people, the leading power in Europe.
Reunification, which was accomplished during Kohl’s
administration and owed much to his efforts, brought rich
political dividends to the Christian Democrats.
But the excitement over reunification soon dissipated
as new problems arose. All too soon, the realization set in
that the revitalization of eastern Germany would take far
more money than was originally thought, and Kohl’s
government was soon forced to face the politically undesirable task of raising taxes substantially. Moreover, the
virtual collapse of the economy in eastern Germany led
to extremely high levels of unemployment and severe
discontent.
East Germans were also haunted by another memory
from their recent past. The opening of the files of the
secret police (the Stasi) showed that millions of East
Germans had spied on their neighbors and colleagues,
and even their spouses and parents, during the Communist era (see Film & History: The Lives of Others on
p. 661). A few senior Stasi officials were put on trial for
their past actions, but many Germans preferred simply to
close the door on an unhappy period in their lives.
As the century neared its close, then, Germans
struggled to cope with the challenge of building a new,
united nation. In 1998, voters took out their frustrations
at the ballot box. Kohl’s conservative coalition was defeated in elections, and a new prime minister, Social
Democrat Gerhard Schroeder (b. 1944), came into office.
But Schroeder had little success at solving Germany’s
economic woes, and as a result of elections in 2005, Angela
Merkel (b. 1954), leader of the Christian Democrats, became the first female chancellor in German history.
Post-Thatcher Britain While Margaret Thatcher dominated British politics in the 1980s, the Labour Party, beset
by divisions between its moderate and radical wings, offered little effective opposition. Only in 1990 did Labour’s
fortunes seem to revive when Thatcher’s government attempted to replace local property taxes with a flat-rate tax
that would enable the rich to pay the same rate as the
poor. In 1990, after antitax riots broke out, Thatcher’s
once remarkable popularity fell to an all-time low. At the
end of November, a revolt within her own party caused
Thatcher to resign as Britain’s longest-serving prime
minister. She was replaced by John Major, whose Conservative Party won a narrow victory in the general elections held in April 1992. His government, however, failed
to capture the imagination of most Britons. In elections
on May 1, 1997, the Labour Party won a landslide victory.
The new prime minister, Tony Blair (b. 1953), was a
moderate whose youthful energy immediately instilled
new vigor into the political scene. Blair was one of the
prominent leaders in forming an international coalition
against terrorism after the terrorist attack on the United
States in 2001. Three years later, his support of the U.S.
war in Iraq, when a majority of Britons opposed it,
caused his popularity to plummet, although the failure of
the Conservative Party to field a popular candidate kept
him in power until the summer of 2007, when he stepped
down and allowed the new Labour leader, Gordon Brown
(b. 1951), to become prime minister.
France: A Move to the Right Although Franc¸ois Mitterrand was able to win a second term as president in
1988, France’s economic decline continued. In 1993,
French unemployment stood at 10.6 percent, and in the
elections in March of that year, the Socialists won only 28
percent of the vote as a coalition of conservative parties
gained 80 percent of the seats in the National Assembly.
The move to the right in France was strengthened when
the conservative mayor of Paris, Jacques Chirac (b. 1932),
was elected president in 1995 and reelected in 2002.
By 1995, resentment against foreign-born residents
had become a growing political reality. Spurred by rising
rates of unemployment and large numbers of immigrants
from North Africa (often identified in the public mind
with terrorist actions committed by militant groups based
in the Middle East), many French voters advocated restrictions on all new immigration. Chirac himself pursued
a plan of sending illegal immigrants back to their home
countries.
In the fall of 2005, however, antiforeign sentiment
provoked a backlash of its own as young Muslims in the
crowded suburbs of Paris rioted against dismal living
conditions and the lack of employment opportunities for
foreign residents in France. After the riots subsided, government officials promised to adopt measures to respond
to the complaints, but tensions between the Muslim
community and the remainder of the French population
have become a chronic source of social unrest throughout
the country---an unrest that Nicolas Sarkozy (b. 1955),
elected as president in 2007, has promised to address.
The Unification of Europe
With the addition of Austria, Finland, and Sweden in
1995, the European Community (EC) had grown to
fifteen members (see Map 30.3). The EC was primarily
an economic union, not a political one. The Treaty on
European Union (also called the Maastricht Treaty after
the city in the Netherlands where the agreement was
reached) represented an attempt to create a true economic and monetary union of all EC members. On
January 1, 1994, the EC renamed itself the European
Union (EU). By 2000, the EU contained 370 million
people and constituted the world’s largest single trading
entity, transacting one-fourth of the world’s commerce.
Another of its goals was to introduce a common currency, called the euro, adopted by twelve EU nations
early in 1999. The European Central Bank was created on
June 1, 1999, and by January 2007, the euro had officially
replaced thirteen national currencies.
Goals In addition to having a single internal market for
its members and a common currency, the EU also established a common agricultural policy, under which
subsidies are provided to farmers to enable them to sell
their goods competitively on the world market. The
policy also provides aid to the EU’s poorest regions as
well as subsidies for job training, education, and modernization. The end of national passports gave millions of
Europeans greater flexibility in travel.
The European Union has been less successful in
setting common foreign policy goals, primarily because
individual nations still see foreign policy as a national
prerogative and are reluctant to give it up to an overriding institution.
Toward a United Europe At the beginning of the
twenty-first century, the EU has established a new goal: to
incorporate into the union the states of eastern and
southeastern Europe. Many of these states are considerably poorer than the older members, which raised the
possibility that adding these nations might weaken the
EU itself. To lessen the danger, EU members established a
set of qualifications that focus on demonstrating a commitment both to market capitalism and to democracy,
including not only the rule of law but also respect for
minorities and human rights. In May 2004, the EU took
the plunge and added ten new members: Cyprus, the
Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania,
Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Their addition
enlarged the population of the EU to 455 million people.
In January 2007, the EU expanded again as Bulgaria and
Romania joined the union.
The United States: Move to the Center
After twelve years of Republican administrations, the Democratic Party captured the U.S. presidency in the elections
in November 1992. The inability of George H. W. Bush
(b. 1924), Ronald Reagan’s successor, to deal with the
deficit problem, as well as an economic downturn, enabled
Democrat Bill Clinton (b. 1946) to become president. The
new president was a southerner who claimed to be a ‘‘new
Democrat’’---one who favored fiscal responsibility and a
more conservative social agenda---a clear indication that
the rightward drift in American politics had not been reversed by his victory. During his first term in office,
Clinton reduced the budget deficit and signed a bill
turning the welfare program back to the states while
pushing measures to provide job opportunities for those
Americans removed from the welfare rolls. By seizing
the center of the American political agenda, Clinton was
able to win reelection in 1996, although the Republican
Party now held a majority in both houses of Congress.
Clinton’s political fortunes were helped considerably by a lengthy economic revival. Much of Clinton’s
second term, however, was overshadowed by charges of
presidential misconduct stemming from the president’s
affair with a White House intern. After a bitter partisan
struggle, the U.S. Senate acquitted the president on
two articles of impeachment brought by the House
of Representatives. But Clinton’s problems helped the
Republican candidate, George W. Bush (b. 1946), win
the presidential election in 2000. Although Bush lost
the popular vote to Al Gore, he narrowly won the
electoral vote after a highly controversial victory in the
state of Florida decided ultimately by the U.S. Supreme
Court.
The first four years of Bush’s administration were
largely occupied with the war on terrorism and the U.S.-
led war on Iraq. The Department of Homeland Security
was established after the 2001 terrorist assaults to help
protect the United States from future terrorist acts. At
the same time, Bush pushed tax cuts through Congress
that mainly favored the wealthy and helped produce
record deficits reminiscent of the Reagan years. Environmentalists were especially disturbed by the Bush administration’s efforts to weaken environmental laws and
impose regulations to benefit American corporations. In
November 2004, Bush was narrowly elected to a second
term, after which his popularity plummeted drastically
as discontent grew over the Iraq War and financial
corruption in the Republican Party, as well as the administration’s poor handling of relief efforts after Hurricane Katrina.
The many failures of the Bush administration led to
the lowest approval ratings for a modern president and
opened the door for a dramatic change in American
politics. A fresh and often inspiring voice---that of Barack
Obama (b. 1961)---who campaigned on a platform of
change ‘‘we can believe in’’ and ending the war in Iraq, led
to an overwhelming Democratic victory in the elections
of 2008. The dramatic collapse of the American financial
system in the fall of 2008 also favored the Democrats.
Obama moved quickly at the beginning of 2009 to deal
with the worst economic recession since the Great Depression. At the same time, Obama emphasized the need
to deal quickly with the health care crisis, global warming,
the decline in the educational system, and failed economic policies.
Contemporary Canada
The government of Brian Mulroney, who came to power
in 1984, sought greater privatization of Canada’s state-run
corporations and negotiated a free trade agreement with
the United States. Bitterly resented by many Canadians,
the agreement cost Mulroney’s government much of its
popularity. In 1993, the ruling Conservatives were overwhelmingly defeated, and the Liberal leader, Jean Chre´tien
(b. 1934), became prime minister. Chre´tien’s conservative
fiscal policies, combined with strong economic growth,
enabled his government to have a budgetary surplus by
the late 1990s and led to another Liberal victory in the
elections of 1997. Charges of widespread financial corruption in the government, however, led to a Conservative victory early in 2006, and Stephen Harper (b. 1959)
became the new prime minister.
Mulroney’s government had been unable to settle
the ongoing crisis over the French-speaking province of
Quebec. In the late 1960s, the Parti Que´be´cois, headed
by Rene´ Le´vesque, ran on a platform of Quebec’s secession from the Canadian union. To pursue their
dream of separation, some underground separatist
groups even resorted to terrorist
bombings. In 1976,
the Parti Que´be´cois
won Quebec’s provincial elections and
in 1980 called for
a referendum that
would enable the
provincial government to negotiate Quebec’s independence from the rest of Canada. Quebec voters narrowly
rejected the plan in 1995, however, and debate over the
province’s status continues.
After the Cold War: New World
Order or Age of Terrorism?
Q Focus Questions: How and why did the Cold War
end? What are the main issues in the struggle against
terrorism?
Even before the collapse of the Soviet Union, there had
been tantalizing signs of a thaw in the Cold War. China
and the United States had decided in 1979 to establish
mutual diplomatic relations, a consequence of Beijing’s
decision to focus on domestic reform and stop supporting wars of national liberation in Asia. Six years later, the
ascent of Mikhail Gorbachev to leadership, culminating
in the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991, brought a
decisive end to almost half a century of bitter rivalry
between the world’s two superpowers.
The End of the Cold War
The accession of Mikhail Gorbachev to power in the
Soviet Union in 1985 eventually brought a dramatic end
to the Cold War. Gorbachev was willing to rethink many
of the fundamental assumptions underlying Soviet foreign policy, and his ‘‘New Thinking,’’ as it was called,
opened the door to a series of stunning changes. For one,
Gorbachev initiated a plan for arms limitation that led in
1987 to an agreement with the United States to eliminate
intermediate-range nuclear weapons (the INF Treaty).
Both sides had incentives to tamp down the expensive
arms race. Gorbachev hoped to make extensive economic
and internal reforms, and the United States had serious
deficit problems. During the Reagan years, the United
States had moved from being a creditor nation to being
the world’s biggest debtor nation. By 1990, both countries
were becoming aware that their large military budgets
made it difficult for them to solve their serious social
problems.
The years 1989 and 1990 were a crucial period in the
ending of the Cold War. As described earlier, the postwar settlements came unstuck as a mostly peaceful
revolutionary upheaval swept through Eastern Europe.
Gorbachev’s policy of allowing greater autonomy for the
Communist regimes of Eastern Europe meant that
the Soviet Union would no longer militarily support
Communist governments that faced internal revolt.
The unwillingness of the Soviet regime to use force to
maintain the status quo, as it had in Hungary in 1956
and in Czechoslovakia in 1968, opened the door to the
overthrow of the Communist regimes. The reunification
of Germany on October 3, 1990, marked the end of one
of the most prominent legacies of the Cold War.
The Persian Gulf War provided the first major opportunity for testing the new relationship between the
United States and the Soviet Union in the post--Cold
War era. In early August 1990, Iraqi military forces invaded and occupied the small neighboring country of
Kuwait, at the top of the Persian Gulf. The Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait sparked a worldwide outcry, and an international force led by the United States liberated Kuwait and
destroyed a substantial portion of Iraq’s armed forces in
the early months of 1991. Gorbachev and the Soviets
played a minor role in the crisis and supported the
American action.
By the end of 1991, the Soviet Union had disintegrated,
making any renewal of global rivalry between the superpowers impossible and leaving the United States as the
world’s leading military power. With the end of superpower rivalry and the collapse of the Soviet Union in
1991, attention focused on the new post--Cold War era.
Many observers were optimistic. U.S. president George
H. W. Bush looked forward to a new era of peace and
international cooperation that he called the ‘‘New World
Order.’’ But the voices of optimism began to fade as it
became clear that forces were now being released that had
long been held in check by the ideological rigidities of the
Cold War. The age of conflict that had long characterized
the twentieth century was not at an end but was simply
beginning to take a different form.
An Age of Terrorism?
Acts of terror by individuals and groups opposed to
governments have become a frightening aspect of modern
Western society and indeed of all the world. In 1996,
President Clinton called terrorism ‘‘the enemy of our
generation,’’ and since the end of Cold War, it has often
seemed as though terrorism has replaced communism as
the West’s number one enemy.
Already during the late 1970s and 1980s, concern
about terrorism was often at the top of foreign policy
agendas in the United States and many European countries. Small bands of terrorists used such tactics as assassination, indiscriminate killing of civilians (especially
by bombing), the taking of hostages, and the hijacking of
airplanes to draw attention to their demands or to destabilize governments in the hope of achieving their
political goals. Terrorist acts garnered considerable media
attention. When Palestinian terrorists kidnapped and
killed eleven Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympic
Games in 1972, hundreds of millions of people watched
the drama unfold on television.
Motivations for terrorist acts varied considerably.
Left-wing groups, such as the Baader-Meinhof gang (also
known as the Red Army Faction) in Germany and the
Red Brigades in Italy, consisted chiefly of affluent middleclass young people who denounced the injustices of
capitalism and supported acts of revolutionary terrorism
in an attempt to bring down the system. Right-wing
terrorist groups, such as the New Order in Italy and the
Charles Martel Club in France, used bombings to foment
disorder and bring about authoritarian regimes. These
groups received little or no public support, and authorities were able to crush them fairly quickly.
But terrorist acts were also committed by militant
nationalists who wished to create separatist states. Because
they received considerable support from local populations
sympathetic to their cause, these terrorist groups could
maintain their activities over a long period of time. Most
prominent was the Irish Republican Army (IRA), which
resorted to vicious attacks against the ruling government
and innocent civilians in Northern Ireland. Over a period
of twenty years, IRA terrorists were responsible for the
deaths of two thousand people in Northern Ireland; threefourths of the victims were civilians.
Terrorist Attack on the United States
One of the most destructive acts of terrorism occurred on
September 11, 2001, in the United States. Four groups of
terrorists hijacked four commercial jet airplanes after
takeoff from Boston, Newark, and Washington, D.C. The
hijackers flew two of the airplanes directly into the towers
of the World Trade Center in New York City, causing these
buildings, as well as a number of surrounding buildings,
to collapse. A third hijacked plane slammed into the Pentagon near Washington, D.C. The fourth plane, apparently
headed for Washington, crashed instead in an isolated area
of Pennsylvania, apparently as the result of an attempt by
a group of heroic passengers to overcome the hijackers. In
total, nearly three thousand people were killed, including
everyone aboard the four airliners.
These coordinated acts of terror were carried out by
hijackers connected to an international terrorist organization known as al-Qaeda (‘‘the Base’’), run by Osama bin
Laden (b. 1957). A native of Saudi Arabia, bin Laden used
an inherited fortune to set up terrorist training camps in
Afghanistan, under the protection of the nation’s militant
fundamentalist Islamic rulers known as the Taliban.
War in Afghanistan U.S. president George W. Bush
vowed to wage a lengthy war on terrorism and worked to
create a coalition of nations to assist in ridding the world of
al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups. In October 2001,
United States and NATO air forces began bombing Talibancontrolled command centers, airfields, and al-Qaeda hiding
places in Afghanistan. On the ground, Afghan forces opposed
to the Taliban, assisted by U.S. special forces, pushed the
Taliban out of the capital city of Kabul and seized control
of nearly all of the country by the end of November. A
multiethnic government was installed but faced problems
from renewed Taliban activity.
War in Iraq In 2002, President Bush, charging that Iraqi
dictator Saddam Hussein had not only provided support
to bin Laden’s terrorist organization but also sought to
develop ‘‘weapons of mass destruction’’ to be used against
the nation’s enemies, threatened to invade Iraq and remove the dictator from power. Both claims were denied
by the Iraqis and widely doubted by other members of the
United Nations; nevertheless, the United States decided to
move against Iraq despite the lack of international support. The U.S. plan upset many Arab leaders and fanned
anti-American sentiment throughout the Muslim world.
In March 2003, a predominantly American army invaded Iraq. The Iraqi troops were quickly defeated, and in
the months that followed, occupation forces sought to
restore stability to the country while setting forth plans to
lay the foundations of a future democratic society. But
although Saddam Hussein was later captured by U.S.
troops, Saddam’s supporters, foreign terrorists, and Islamic
militants continued to battle the American-led forces.
U.S. efforts focused on training an Iraqi military
capable of defeating the insurgents and establishing an
Iraqi government that could hold free elections and create
a democracy. Establishing a new government was difficult, however, because of differences among the three
major groups in Iraqi society: Shi’ite Muslims, Sunni
Muslims, and ethnic Kurds. Although a new Iraqi government came into being, it proved unable to establish a
unified state. By 2006, violence had increased dramatically, and Iraq seemed to be descending into civil war
between the Shi’ites, who control southern Iraq, and the
Sunnis, who control central Iraq. An increase in American
troops in 2007 helped stabilize conditions within a year.
The U.S. and Iraqi governments then agreed to a complete withdrawal of American troops by 2011.
New Directions and New
Problems in Western Society
Q Focus Questions: What major developments have
occurred in the women’s movement since 1985? What
problems have immigrants created for European
society?
Dramatic social developments have accompanied political and economic changes since 1985. New opportunities for women have emerged, and a reinvigorated
women’s movement has sought to bring new meaning to
the principle of equality with men. New problems for
Western society have also arisen with a growing reaction
against foreign workers and immigrants.
Transformation in Women’s Lives
Parents need to produce an average of 2.1 children to
maintain the level of a country’s population. In many
European countries, birthrates first fell short of that
number in the 1960s, and the decline has continued since
then. By the 1990s, among the nations of the European
Union, the average number of children per mother was
1.4. Spain’s rate of 1.15 in 2002 was among the lowest the
world had ever seen.
At the same time, the number of women in the workforce continued to rise. In Britain, for example, women
made up 44 percent of the labor force in 1990, up from
32 percent in 1970. Moreover, women were entering new
employment areas. Greater access to universities and
professional schools enabled women to take jobs in law,
medicine, government, business, and education. In the
Soviet Union, for example, about 70 percent of doctors
and teachers were women. Nevertheless, economic inequality still often prevailed; women received lower wages
than men for comparable work and found fewer opportunities for advancement to management positions.
The Women’s Movement Feminists in the women’s
liberation movement came to believe that women themselves must transform the fundamental conditions of their
lives. They did so in a variety of ways. First, they formed
numerous ‘‘consciousness-raising’’ groups to heighten
awareness of women’s issues. Women got together to
share their personal experiences and become aware of the
many ways that male dominance affected their lives.
This consciousness-raising helped many women become
activists.
Women also sought and gained a measure of control
over their own bodies by insisting that they had a right to
both contraception and abortion. In the 1960s and 1970s,
hundreds of thousands of European women worked to
repeal the laws that outlawed contraception and abortion.
In 1968, a French law permitted the sale of contraceptive
devices, and soon thereafter, French feminists began
calling for the legalization of abortion; in 1979, abortion
became legal in France. Even in countries where the
Catholic church remained adamantly opposed to abortion, legislation allowing contraception and abortion was
passed in the 1970s and 1980s.
As more women became activists, they also became
involved in new issues. In the 1980s and 1990s, women
faculty in universities concentrated on influencing cultural
attitudes through the new academic field of women’s
studies, which stressed the role and contributions of
women in history. As a result, courses in women’s studies
proliferated in both American and European colleges and
universities.
Other women began to try to affect the political
environment by allying with the antinuclear movement.
In 1982, a group of women protested American nuclear
missiles in Britain by chaining themselves to the fence of
an American military base. Thousands more joined in
creating a peace camp around the military compound.
Enthusiasm ran high; one participant said, ‘‘I’ll never
forget that feeling; it’ll live with me forever. . . . We walked
round, and we clasped hands. . . . It was for women; it was
for peace; it was for the world.’’3
Some women joined the ecological movement. As one
German writer who was concerned with environmental
issues said, it is women ‘‘who must give birth to children,
willingly or unwillingly, in this polluted world of ours.’’
Especially prominent were the female members of the
Green Party in Germany (see ‘‘The Environment and the
Green Movements’’ in Chapter 29), which supported environmental issues and elected forty-two delegates to the
West German parliament in 1987. Among the delegates was
Petra Kelly (b. 1947), one of the founders of the German
Green Party and a tireless campaigner for the preservation
of the environment as well as human rights and equality.
Women in the West have
also reached out to work with
women from the rest of the
world in international conferences to change the conditions of their lives. Between
1975 and 1995, the United
Nations held women’s conferences in Mexico City,
Copenhagen, Nairobi, and
Beijing. These meetings made
clear that women from Western and non-Western countries had different priorities.
Whereas women from Western countries spoke about
political, economic, cultural,
and sexual rights, women
from developing countries in
Latin America, Africa, and
Asia focused on bringing an
end to the violence, hunger,
and disease that haunted their
lives. Despite these differences, the meetings were an
indication of how women in
both developed and developing nations were organizing
to make all people aware of women’s issues.
Guest Workers and Immigrants
As the economies of the Western European countries
revived in the 1950s and 1960s, a severe labor shortage
encouraged them to rely on foreign workers. Government
and businesses actively recruited so-called guest workers
to staff essential jobs. Scores of Turks and eastern and
southern Europeans came to Germany, North Africans to
France, and people from the Caribbean, India, and
Pakistan to Great Britain. Overall, there were probably
15 million guest workers in Europe in the 1980s. They
constituted 17 percent of the labor force in Switzerland
and 10 percent in Germany.
In the 1980s, there was an influx of other refugees,
especially to West Germany, which had liberal immigration laws that permitted people seeking asylum for political persecution to enter the country. During the 1970s
and 1980s, West Germany absorbed over a million refugees
from Eastern Europe and East Germany. In 1986 alone,
200,000 political refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and
Sri Lanka entered the country. Other parts of Europe saw a
similar influx of foreigners. Between 1992 and 2002,
London and the southeast region of England witnessed an
increase of 700,000 foreigners, primarily from Yugoslavia,
Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. A survey in
1998 found that English was not the first language of onethird of inner-city children in London.
The arrival of so many foreigners strained not only
the social services of European countries but also the
patience of many native residents who opposed the sudden ethnic diversification of their countries. Antiforeign
sentiment increased, especially as domestic unemployment grew, and it was stoked by right-wing political
parties that catered to people’s complaints. Although these
parties had only limited success in elections, their modest
accomplishments encouraged traditional parties to adopt
more nationalistic policies. Occasionally, an antiforeign
party enjoyed particular success. In Austria, Jorg Haider,
whose Freedom Party received 27 percent of the vote in
1999, cushioned his rejection of foreigners by appealing to
Austrian nationalism and attacking the European Union:
‘‘We Austrians should answer not to the European Union,
not to Maastricht, not to some international idea or other,
but to this our Homeland.’’4 Even more frightening than
the growth of these right-wing political parties were the
organized campaigns of violence in the early 1990s, especially against African and Asian immigrants, by radical,
right-wing groups (see the box above).
Western Culture Today
Q Focus Questions: What major Western cultural trends
have emerged since 1985? What is the Digital Age, and
what are its products, results, and dangers?
Western culture has expanded to most parts of the world,
although some societies see it as a challenge to their own
culture and national identity. At the same time, other
societies are also strongly influencing Western cultural
expressions, making recent Western culture a reflection of
the evolving global response to the rapid changes in human society today.
Varieties of Religious Life
Despite the revival of religion after World War II, church
attendance in Europe and the United States declined
dramatically in the 1960s and 1970s as a result of growing
secular attitudes. Yet even though the numbers of regular
churchgoers in established Protestant and Catholic
churches continued to decline, the number of fundamentalist churches and churchgoers has been growing,
especially in the United States.
Fundamentalism was originally a movement within
Protestantism that arose early in the twentieth century.
Its goal was to maintain a strict traditional interpretation
of the Bible and the Christian faith, especially in opposition to the theory of Darwinian evolution and secularism. In the 1980s and 1990s, fundamentalists became
involved in a struggle against ‘‘secular humanism,’’ ‘‘godless communism,’’ legalized abortion, and homosexuality. Especially in the United States, fundamentalists
organized politically to elect candidates who supported
their views.
The Growth of Islam Fundamentalism, however, was
not unique to Protestantism. In Islam, the term fundamentalism is used to refer to a return to traditional Islamic values, especially in opposition to a perceived
weakening of morality due to the corrupting influence of
Western ideas and practices. After the Iranian Revolution
of 1979, the term was also applied to radical Islamic
movements, such as the Taliban in Afghanistan, who favored militant action against Western influence.
Despite the wariness of Islamic radicalism in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on
the United States, Islam is growing in both Europe and
the United States, thanks primarily to the migration of
people from Muslim countries. As Muslim communities
became established in France, Germany, Britain, Italy, and
Spain during the 1980s and 1990s, they built mosques for
religious worship and religious education.
Pope John Paul II Although changes have also occurred
in the Roman Catholic Church, much of its history in the
1980s and 1990s was dominated by the charismatic Pope
John Paul II (1920--2005). Karol Wojtyla, who had been
the archbishop of Krakow in Poland before his elevation
to the papacy in 1978, was the first non-Italian to be
elected pope since the sixteenth century. Although he
alienated a number of people by reasserting traditional
Catholic teaching on such issues as birth control, women
in the priesthood, and clerical celibacy, John Paul’s numerous travels around the world helped strengthen the
Catholic church throughout the non-Western world. John
Paul was a powerful figure in reminding Europeans of
their spiritual heritage and the need to temper the pursuit
of materialism with spiritual concerns.
Art in the Age of Commerce:
The 1980s and 1990s
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the art industry increasingly adopted the techniques of marketing and advertising. With large sums of money invested in artists,
pressure mounted to achieve critical and commercial success. Negotiating the distinction between art and popular
culture was essential because many people equated merit
with sales or economic value.
In the art world, Neo-Expressionism reached its
zenith in the mid-1980s. The economic boom and free
spending of the Reagan years contributed to a thriving art
scene in the United States. Neo-Expressionist artists like
Anselm Kiefer (b. 1945) and Jean-Michel Basquiat (1960--
1988) became increasingly popular as the art market
soared.
The German-born Kiefer combines aspects of Abstract Expressionism, collage, and German Expressionism
to create works that are stark and haunting. His Departure
from Egypt (1984) is a meditation on Jewish history and
its descent into the horrors of Nazism. Kiefer hoped that a
portrayal of Germany’s atrocities could free Germans
from their past and bring some good out of evil. Another
example of Neo-Expressionism can be seen in the work of
Basquiat. The son of Haitian and Puerto Rican immigrants, Basquiat first made his name as a graffiti artist in
New York City and became an overnight success during
the 1980s art market boom.
The Digital Age
Since the invention of the microprocessor in 1971, the
capabilities of computers have continued to grow, resulting in the Information Age or Digital Age we know
today. Beginning in the 1980s, companies such as Apple
and Microsoft competed to create ever more powerful
computers. By the 1990s, the booming technology industry had made Microsoft founder Bill Gates the
richest man in the world. Much of this success was due to
several innovations that made computers virtually indispensable in the fields of communication, information,
and entertainment.
The Technological World Electronic mail, or e-mail, is
a form of computerized communication that became
popular in the mid-1990s. As the capacity of computers
to transmit data increased, e-mail messages could carry
document and image attachments, making them a workable and speedier alternative to conventional postal mail.
The World Wide Web, launched in 1990, is a system of
interlinked documents and other computer files accessed
via the Internet, a globe-spanning computerized system
for information exchange in operation since 1971. Programs known as browsers permit Internet users to connect
to electronic files (‘‘Web sites’’) devoted to news, commerce, entertainment, academic scholarship, and other
areas of interest.
Advances in telecommunications led to wireless cellular or mobile telephones. Although cellular phones existed in the 1970s and 1980s, it was not until the digital
components of these devices were reduced in size in the
1990s that the phones became truly portable. The ubiquity
of cell phones today and their ability to transfer data
electronically have made text messaging via the phones a
global communications craze. Text messaging and instant
messaging have revolutionized written language as shorthand script has replaced words and even complete sentences for the purposes of relaying brief messages rapidly.
In 2001, Apple introduced the iPod, a portable digital
music player. The pocket-sized device has revolutionized
the music industry, to the point that downloading music
from the Internet has now far surpassed the purchasing of
singles and albums from record stores.
Music and Art in the Digital Age Whereas the iPod
altered the way in which we listen to, store, and access
music, innovations in digital technology have changed the
sound and production of music. In the late 1990s, musicians such as Moby and Fatboy Slim became internationally famous for creating music layered with synthesizers,
distorted guitars, and simulated drum beats. These artists
‘‘sampled’’ snippets of earlier soul music to create albums
and film scores.
Many visual artists have also adopted digital effects in
producing artworks that fuse photography, sculpture, and
cinema. Bill Viola (b. 1951) was one of the first artists to
exclusively employ video in his exhibits. By projecting films
in a gallery space, Viola created powerful sensory experiences. He evoked mystical sensations with his allusions to
rebirth and mysticism, contrasting light, sound, and focus
with techniques of slow motion and editing.
Film: Fantasy and Epics The films, video games, and
literature of the late 1990s and early 2000s made fantasy
and historical epics internationally popular. The successful
adaptation of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and the Harry
Potter series indicated the manner in which mythology,
magic, and medieval fantasies appeal to contemporary
sensibilities. At the heart of these epic motion pictures,
Troy and Gladiator included, is a mythical struggle between
good and evil that is governed by a moral sense of right
and wrong, love, and companionship. Yet these romanticized tales also featured non-Western cultures as Japanese
anime´ and martial arts films increased in worldwide
popularity. The computer animation and digitized special
effects of these movies reflect the impact of computers on
the film industry as it too enters the Digital Age.
Literature in the Digital Age Advances in communication and information during the Digital Age have led
many to believe that world cultures are becoming increasingly interdependent and homogenized. The interaction of East and West has also preoccupied numerous
authors since the late 1990s. Jhumpa Lahiri (b. 1967) has
received international attention for writings that explore
contemporary Indian life. Lahiri won the Pulitzer Prize
for her collection of stories, Interpreter of Maladies (1999),
and her first novel, The Namesake (2003), chronicled the
lives of Indian immigrants in the United States. Both
works examine generation gaps, particularly the alienation and unique synthesis that can accompany crosscultural exchange. The success of Lahiri’s work and other
novels such as Arthur Golden’s Memoirs of a Geisha
(1997) indicates how, in the Digital Age, Western peoples
remain interested in other cultures and traditions. This
emergence of a global culture has become part of the new
globalism at the beginning of the twenty-first century.
Toward a Global Civilization
Q Focus Question: What is globalization, and what are
its main characteristics in the twenty-first century?
Multiculturalism in the arts reminds us that more and
more people are becoming aware of the political, economic, and social interdependence of the world’s nations
and the global nature of our contemporary problems. We
are coming to understand that destructive forces generated in one part of the world soon affect the entire world.
Smokestack pollution in one nation can produce acid
rain in another. Oil spills and dumping of wastes in the
ocean have an impact on the shores of many nations. As
crises of food, water, energy, and natural resources proliferate, one nation’s solutions often become other
nations’ problems. The new globalism includes the recognition that the challenges that seem to threaten human
existence today are global.
As noted in the discussion of the Digital Age, an important part of global awareness is the technological dimension. The growth of new technology has made possible
levels of world communication that simply did not exist
before. At the same time that Osama bin Laden and alQaeda were denouncing the forces of modernization, they
were doing so using advanced telecommunication systems
that had only recently been developed. The technology
revolution has tied peoples and nations closely together
and contributed to globalization, the term that is frequently used to describe the process by which peoples and
nations have become more interdependent. Economically,
globalization has taken the form of a global economy.
The Global Economy
Especially since the 1970s, the world has developed a
global economy in which the production, distribution,
and sale of goods are accomplished on a worldwide scale.
Several international institutions have contributed to the
rise of the global economy. Soon after the end of World
War II in 1945, the United States and other nations established the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF). The World Bank is a group of five international organizations, largely controlled by developed
countries, which provides grants, loans, and advice for
economic development to developing countries. The goal
of the IMF is to oversee the global financial system by
supervising exchange rates and offering financial and
technical assistance to developing nations. Today, 185
countries are members of the IMF. Critics have argued
that both the World Bank and the IMF push inappropriate
Western economic practices on non-Western nations that
only aggravate the poverty and debt of developing nations.
Another reflection of the new global economic order
is the multinational corporation or transnational corporation (a company that has divisions in more than two
countries). Prominent examples of multinational corporations include Siemens, General Motors, ExxonMobil,
Mitsubishi, and the Sony Corporation. These companies
are among the two hundred largest multinational corporations, which are responsible for more than half of the
world’s industrial production. A recent comparison of
corporate sales and national gross domestic product
disclosed that only half of the world’s largest economies
are nations; the other half are corporations.
Globalization and the Environmental Crisis
Taking a global perspective at the beginning of the
twenty-first century has led many people to realize that
everywhere on the planet, human beings are interdependent in regard to the air they breathe, the water they
drink, the food they consume, and the climate that affects
their lives. At the same time, however, human activities
are creating environmental challenges that threaten the
very foundation of human existence on earth.
One problem is population growth. As of July 2006,
the world population was estimated at more than 6.5
billion people, only eighteen years after passing the 5 billion mark. At its current rate of growth, the world population could reach 12.8 billion by 2050, according to the
United Nations’ long-range population projections. The
result has been an increased demand for food and other
resources that has put great pressure on the earth’s ecosystems. At the same time, the failure to grow enough food
for more and more people has created a severe problem as
an estimated one billion people worldwide today suffer
from hunger. Every year, more than eight million people
die of hunger, many of them young children.
Yet another threat to the environment is global
warming, which has the potential to cause great chaos.
Virtually all of the world’s scientists agree that the
greenhouse effect, the warming of the earth because of
the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, is
contributing to devastating droughts and storms, the
melting of the polar ice caps, and rising sea levels that
could inundate coastal regions in the second half of the
twenty-first century. Also alarming is the potential loss of
biodiversity. Seven out of ten biologists believe that the
planet is now experiencing an alarming extinction of both
plant and animal species.
The Social Challenges of Globalization
Since 1945, tens of millions of people have migrated from
one part of the world to another. These migrations have
occurred for many reasons. Persecution for political reasons caused many people from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri
Lanka, and Eastern Europe to seek refuge in Western
European countries, while brutal civil wars in Asia, Africa,
the Middle East, and Europe led millions of refugees to
seek safety in neighboring countries. Most people who
have migrated, however, have done so to find jobs. Latin
Americans seeking a better life have migrated to the
United States, while guest workers from Turkey, southern
and eastern Europe, North Africa, India, and Pakistan have
migrated to more prosperous Western European lands. In
2005, nearly 200 million people, about 3 percent of the
world’s population, lived outside the country where they
were born. As discussed earlier, the migration of millions
of people has created a social backlash in many countries.
Another challenge of globalization is the wide gap
between rich and poor nations. The rich nations, or developed nations, include countries such as the United
States, Canada, Germany, and Japan, which have wellorganized industrial and agricultural systems, advanced
technologies, and effective educational systems. The poor
nations, or developing nations, include many countries in
Africa, Asia, and Latin America, which often have primarily
agricultural economies with little technology. A serious
problem in many developing nations is explosive population growth, which has led to severe food shortages often
caused by poor soil but also by economic factors. Growing
crops for export to developed countries, for example, may
lead to enormous profits for large landowners but leaves
many small farmers with little land on which to grow food.
New Global Movements and New Hopes
As the heirs of Western civilization have become aware
that the problems humans face are not just national but
global, they have responded to this challenge in different
ways. One approach has been to develop grassroots social
movements, including environmental, women’s and men’s
liberation, human potential, appropriate-technology, and
nonviolence movements. ‘‘Think globally, act locally’’ is
frequently the slogan of these grassroots groups. Related to
the emergence of these social movements is the growth of
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). According to one
analyst, NGOs are an important instrument in the cultivation of global perspectives: ‘‘Since NGOs by definition are
identified with interests that transcend national boundaries,
we expect all NGOs to define problems in global terms, to
take account of human interests and needs as they are
found in all parts of the planet.’’5 NGOs are often represented at the United Nations and include professional,
business, and cooperative organizations; foundations; religious, peace, and disarmament groups; youth and women’s
organizations; environmental and human rights groups;
and research institutes. The number of international NGOs
increased from 176 in 1910 to 37,000 in 2000.
And yet hopes for global approaches to global problems have also been hindered by political, ethnic, and religious disputes. Pollution of the Rhine River by factories
along its banks provokes angry disputes among European
nations, and the United States and Canada have argued
about the effects of acid rain on Canadian forests. The
bloody conflict in the former Yugoslavia indicates the
dangers inherent in the rise of nationalist sentiment among
various ethnic and religious groups in Eastern Europe. The
widening gap between wealthy nations and poor, developing nations threatens global economic stability. Many
conflicts begin with regional issues and then develop into
international concerns. International terrorist groups seek
to wreak havoc around the world.
Thus even as the world becomes more global in culture and interdependent in its mutual relations, centrifugal
forces are still at work attempting to redefine the political,
cultural, and ethnic ways in which the world is divided.
Such efforts are often disruptive and can sometimes work
against measures to enhance our human destiny.
Many lessons can be learned from the history of
Western civilization, but one of them is especially clear.
Lack of involvement in the affairs of one’s society can lead
to a sense of powerlessness. In an age that is often crisisladen and chaotic, an understanding of our Western
heritage and its lessons can be instrumental in helping us
create new models for the future. For we are all creators
of history, and the future of Western and indeed world
civilization depends on us.
