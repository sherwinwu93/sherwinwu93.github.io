<h2 id="orgb825a82">11 The later Middle Ages, Crisis and Disintegration in the fourteenth century</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb825a82">
<p class="verse">
European civilization developed many of its fundamental features<br />
&#xa0;in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries.<br />
Territorial states, parliaments,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;capitalist trade and industry, banks, cities, and vernacular literatures<br />
&#xa0;were all products of that fertile period.<br />
During the same time, the Catholic church under the direction of the papacy reached its apogee.<br />
European society in the fourteenth century, however,<br />
&#xa0;was challenged by an overwhelming number of crises.<br />
Devastating plague, decline in trade and industry, bank failures,<br />
&#xa0;peasant revolts pitting lower classes against the upper classes,<br />
&#xa0;seemingly constant warfare,<br />
&#xa0;aristocratic factional conflict that undermined political stability,<br />
&#xa0;the absence of the popes from Rome,<br />
&#xa0;and even the spectacle of two popes condemning each other as the Antichrist<br />
&#xa0;all seemed to overpower Europeans in this 'calamitous century.'<br />
Not surprisingly,<br />
&#xa0;much of the art of the period depicted the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;described in the New Testament book of Revelation: Death, Famine, Pestilence, and War.<br />
To some people, no doubt, the last days of the world seemed to be at hand.<br />
<br />
The new European society, however, proved remarkably resilient.<br />
Periods of crisis usually give rise to new ideas and new practices.<br />
Intellectuals of the period saw themselves<br />
&#xa0;as standing on the threshold of a new age<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and a rebirth of the best features of Classical civilization,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;an era widely referred to as the Renaissance.<br />
