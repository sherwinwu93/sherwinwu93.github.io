<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4193917">
<p class="verse">
As a result of their conquests in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries,<br />
&#xa0;the Mongols assembled a vast empire stretching from Russia in the west to China in the east.<br />
Mongol rule brought stability to the Eurasian trade routes;<br />
&#xa0;increased trade brought prosperity but also avenues for the spread of flea-infested rats<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that carried bubonic plague to both East Asia and Europe.<br />
In the mid-fourteenth century,<br />
&#xa0;one of the most destructive natural disasters in history erupted&#x2014;the Black Death.<br />
One contemporary observer named Henry Knighton,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;a canon of Saint Mary-of-the-Meadow Abbey in Leicester, England,<br />
&#xa0;was simply overwhelmed by the magnitude of the catastrophe.<br />
Knighton began his account of the great plague with these words:<br />
&#xa0;In this year [1348] and in the following one<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;there was a general mortality of people throughout the whole world.<br />
Few were left untouched;<br />
&#xa0;the plague struck even isolated monasteries:<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;At Montpellier, there remained out of a hundred and forty friars only seven.<br />
Knighton was also stunned by the economic and social consequences of the Black Death.<br />
Prices dropped: And the price of everything was cheap, because of the fear of death;<br />
&#xa0;there were very few who took any care for their wealth, or for anything else.<br />
Meanwhile, laborers were scarce, so their wages increased:<br />
&#xa0;In the following autumn,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;one could not hire a reaper at a lower wage than eight pence with food,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;or a mower at less than twelve pence with food.<br />
Because of this, much grain rotted in the fields for lack of harvesting.<br />
So many people died that some towns were deserted and some villages disappeared altogether:<br />
&#xa0;Many small villages and hamlets were completely deserted;<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;there was not one house left in them, but all those who had lived in them were dead.<br />
Some people thought the end of the world was at hand.<br />
<br />
Plague was not the only disaster in the fourteenth century, however.<br />
Signs of disintegration were everywhere:<br />
&#xa0;famine, economic depression, war, social upheaval, a rise in crime and violence,<br />
&#xa0;and a decline in the power of the universal Catholic church.<br />
Periods of disintegration, however, are often fertile grounds for change and new developments.<br />
Out of the dissolution of medieval civilization came a rebirth of culture<br />
&#xa0;that has come to be known as the Renaissance.<br />
