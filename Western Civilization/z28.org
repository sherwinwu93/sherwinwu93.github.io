THE END OF WORLD WAR II in Europe was met with great
joy. One visitor to Moscow reported, ‘‘I looked out of the window
[at 2 A.M.], almost everywhere there were lights in the window---
people were staying awake. Everyone embraced everyone else, someone sobbed aloud.’’ But after the victory parades and celebrations,
Europeans awoke to a devastating realization: their civilization was
in ruins. Some wondered if Europe would ever regain its former
prosperity and importance. Winston Churchill wrote, ‘‘What is
Europe now? A rubble heap, a charnel house, a breeding ground of
pestilence and hate.’’ There was ample reason for his pessimism.
Forty million people (both soldiers and civilians) had been killed
during the last six years. Massive air raids and artillery bombardments had reduced many of the great cities of Europe to heaps of
rubble. An American general described Berlin: ‘‘Wherever we looked
we saw desolation. It was like a city of the dead. Suffering and
shock were visible in every face. Dead bodies still remained in canals
and lakes and were being dug out from under bomb debris.’’
Millions of Europeans faced starvation because grain harvests were
only half of what they had been in 1939. Millions were also homeless. In the parts of the Soviet Union that had been occupied by
the Germans, almost 25 million people were without homes.
The destruction of bridges, roads, and railroads had left transportation systems paralyzed. Eleven million prisoners of war had to be
returned to their native countries, and fifteen million Germans and
Eastern Europeans were driven out of countries where they were no
longer wanted. Yet despite the chaos, Europe was soon on the road
to a remarkable recovery. Already by 1950, Europe’s industrial and
agricultural output was 30 percent above prewar levels.
World War II had also destroyed European supremacy in
world affairs. After 1945, the colonial empires of the European
nations rapidly disintegrated, and Europe’s place in the world
changed radically. As the Cold War conflict between the world’s two
superpowers---the United States and the Soviet Union---intensified,
the European nations were divided into two armed camps dependent on one or the other of these two major powers. The United
States and the Soviet Union, whose rivalry raised the specter of
nuclear war, seemed to hold the survival of Europe and the world
in their hands.
Development of the Cold War
Q Focus Questions: Why were the United States and the
Soviet Union suspicious of each other after World War II,
and what events between 1945 and 1949 heightened the
tensions between the two nations? How and why did the
Cold War become a global affair after 1949?
Even before World War II had ended, the two major
Allied powers---the United States and the Soviet Union---
had begun to disagree on their vision for postwar Europe.
Unity had been maintained during the war because of the
urgent need to defeat the Axis powers, but once their
defeat was assured, differences between the Americans
and Soviets again surged to the fore.
Confrontation of the Superpowers
Considerable historical debate has been waged about who
was responsible for starting the Cold War. Both the
United States and the Soviet Union took steps at the end
of World War II that were unwise or might have been
avoided. Both nations, however, were working within a
framework conditioned by the past. Ultimately, the rivalry between the two superpowers stemmed from their
different historical perspectives and their irreconcilable
political ambitions. Intense competition for political and
military supremacy had long been a regular feature of
Western civilization. The United States and the Soviet
Union were the heirs of that European tradition of power
politics, and it should not surprise us that two such different systems would seek to extend their way of life to
the rest of the world. Because of its need to feel secure
on its western border, the Soviet Union was not prepared
to give up the advantages it had gained in Eastern Europe
from Germany’s defeat. But neither were American
leaders willing to give up the power and prestige the
United States had gained throughout the world. Suspicious of each other’s motives, the two nations soon raised
their mutual fears to a level of intense competition (see
the box on p. 609). Between 1945 and 1949, a number of
events entangled the two in irreconcilable conflict.
Eastern Europe was the first area of disagreement.
The United States and Great Britain had championed selfdetermination and democratic freedom for the liberated
nations of Eastern Europe. Stalin, however, fearful that the
Eastern European nations would return to traditional
anti-Soviet attitudes if they were permitted free elections,
opposed the West’s plans. Having liberated Eastern Europe
from the Nazis, the Red Army proceeded to install proSoviet governing regimes in Poland, Romania, Bulgaria,
and Hungary. These pro-Soviet governments satisfied
Stalin’s desire for a buffer zone against the West, but the
local populations and their sympathizers in the West regarded the regimes as an expansion of Stalin’s empire.
The Truman Doctrine A civil war in Greece served as
another arena for confrontation between the superpowers.
In 1946, the Communist People’s Liberation Army and the
anti-Communist forces supported by the British were
fighting each other for control of Greece. Great Britain
had initially assumed primary responsibility for promoting postwar reconstruction in the eastern Mediterranean,
but in 1947, ongoing economic problems caused the
British to withdraw from the active role they had been
playing in both Greece and Turkey. President Harry Truman of the United States, alarmed by British weakness and
the possibility of Soviet expansion into the eastern Mediterranean, responded with the Truman Doctrine. Truman requested $400 million in economic and military aid
for Greece and Turkey from the U.S. Congress. The Truman Doctrine said, in essence, that the United States
would provide money to countries that claimed they were
threatened by Communist expansion. If the Soviets were
not stopped in Greece, the United States would have to
face the spread of communism throughout the free world.
As Dean Acheson, the American secretary of state, explained, ‘‘Like apples in a barrel infected by disease, the
corruption of Greece would infect Iran and all the
East. . . likewise Africa. . . Italy. . . France.. . . Not since
Rome and Carthage has there been such a polarization of
power on this earth.’’1
The proclamation of the Truman Doctrine was soon
followed in June 1947 by the European Recovery Program, better known as the Marshall Plan. Intended to
rebuild prosperity and stability, this program included
$13 billion for the economic recovery of war-torn Europe.
Underlying it was the belief that Communist aggression
fed off economic turmoil. General George C. Marshall
had noted in a speech at Harvard, ‘‘Our policy is not
directed against any country or doctrine but against
hunger, poverty, desperation, and chaos.’’2 From the Soviet perspective, the Marshall Plan guaranteed ‘‘the
American loans in return for the relinquishing by the
European states of their economic and later also their
political independence.’’ To some scholars, the Marshall
Plan encouraged Stalin to push for even greater control of
Eastern Europe to safeguard Soviet interests.
Containment By 1947, the split in Europe between East
and West had become a fact of life. At the end of World
War II, the United States had favored a quick end to its
commitments in Europe. But American fears of Soviet
aims caused the United States to play an increasingly large
role in Europe. In an important article in Foreign Affairs in
July 1947, George Kennan, a well-known American diplomat with much knowledge of Soviet affairs, advocated a
policy of containment against further aggression by the
Soviets. Kennan favored the ‘‘adroit and vigilant application of counterforce at a series of constantly shifting
geographical and political points, corresponding to the
shifts and manoeuvres of Soviet policy.’’ By 1948, containment of the Soviet Union became formal American
policy.
Contention over Germany The fate of Germany also
became a source of heated contention between East and
West. Besides the partitioning of Germany (and Berlin)
into four occupied zones, the Allied powers had agreed
on little else with regard to the conquered nation. The
Soviets, hardest hit by the war, took reparations from
Germany in the form of booty. The technology-starved
Soviets dismantled and removed to Russia 380 factories
from the western zones of Berlin
before transferring their control to
the Western powers. At the same
time, the German Communist Party
was reestablished under the control
of Walter Ulbricht (1893--1973) and
was soon in charge of the political
reconstruction of the Soviet zone in
eastern Germany.
At the same time, the British,
French, and Americans gradually
began to merge their zones economically and by February 1948
were making plans for the unification of these three western sections
of Germany and the formal creation
of a West German federal government. The Soviets responded with
a blockade of West Berlin that allowed neither trucks nor trains to
enter the three western zones of
Berlin.
The Western powers faced a dilemma. Direct military confrontation
seemed dangerous, and no one wished to risk World War
III. Therefore, an attempt to break through the blockade
with tanks and trucks was ruled out. The solution was the
Berlin Air Lift. It was an enormous undertaking. Western
Allied air forces worked around the clock for almost a
year to supply the city of Berlin with foodstuffs as well as
the coal, oil, and gasoline needed to run the city’s power
stations, sewer plants, and factories and to heat the city’s
dwellings. At its peak, 13,000 tons of supplies were flown
to Berlin daily. Altogether the Western allies shipped
2.3 million tons of food on 277,500 flights. Seventy-three
Allied airmen lost their lives due to accidents. The Soviets, also not wanting war, did not interfere and finally
lifted the blockade in May 1949. The blockade of Berlin
had severely increased tensions between the United States
and the Soviet Union and resulted in the separation
of Germany into two states. The Federal Republic of
Germany, known as West Germany, was formally created
in September 1949, and a month later, the separate German
Democratic Republic was established in East Germany.
Berlin remained a divided city and the source of much
contention between East and West.
New Military Alliances The Soviet Union also detonated its first atomic bomb in 1949, and all too soon, both
powers were involved in an escalating arms race that resulted in the construction of ever more destructive nuclear
weapons. Soon the search for security took the form of
mutual deterrence, the belief that an arsenal of nuclear
weapons prevented war by ensuring that if one nation
launched nuclear weapons in a preemptive first strike, the
other nation would be able to respond and devastate the
attacker. It was assumed that neither side would risk using
the massive arsenals that had been assembled.
The search for security in the uncertain atmosphere
of the Cold War also led to the formation of military
alliances. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
was formed in April 1949 when Belgium, Luxembourg,
the Netherlands, France, Britain, Italy, Denmark, Norway,
Portugal, and Iceland signed a treaty with the United
States and Canada. All the powers agreed to provide
mutual assistance if any one of them was attacked. A few
years later, West Germany, Greece, and Turkey joined
NATO.
The Eastern European states soon followed suit. In
1955, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany,
Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the Soviet Union organized a formal military alliance known as the Warsaw
Pact. Like so many times before, Europe was divided into
hostile alliance systems.
Globalization of the Cold War
The Cold War soon spread from Europe to the rest of the
world. The victory of the Chinese Communists in 1949 in
the Chinese civil war brought a new Communist regime
and intensified American fears about the spread of
communism. Shortly thereafter, the Korean War turned
the Cold War into a worldwide struggle, eventually
leading to a system of military alliances around the globe.
The Korean War Korea had been liberated from the
Japanese in 1945 but soon split into two parts. The
land north of the 38th parallel became the Democratic
People’s Republic of
Korea (North Korea)
and was supported
by the Soviet Union. The Republic
of Korea (South
Korea) received aid
from the United
States. In 1950,
probably with Stalin’s approval, North
Korean forces invaded South Korea.
The Americans, seeing this as yet another example of
Communist aggression and expansion,
gained the support of the United Nations and intervened
by sending American troops to turn back the invasion.
When the American and South Korean forces pushed the
North Koreans back toward the Chinese border, Chinese
forces entered the fray and forced the American and South
Korean troops to retreat back to South Korea. Believing
that the Chinese were simply the puppets of Moscow,
American policy makers created an image of communism
as a monolithic force directed by the Soviet Union. After
two more years of inconclusive fighting, an uneasy truce
was reached in 1953, leaving Korea divided. To many
Americans, the policy of containing communism had
succeeded in Asia, just as it had earlier in Europe.
Escalation of the Cold War The Korean experience
seemed to confirm American fears of communist expansion and reinforced American determination to contain
Soviet power. In the mid-1950s, the administration of
President Dwight D. Eisenhower (1890--1969) adopted a
policy of massive retaliation, which advocated the full use
of American nuclear bombs to counteract even a Soviet
ground attack in Europe. Moreover, American military
alliances were extended around the world. The Central
Treaty Organization (CENTO) of Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Britain, and the United States was intended to
prevent the Soviet Union from expanding at the expense
of its southern neighbors. The United States, Britain,
France, Pakistan, Thailand, the Philippines, Australia, and
New Zealand formed the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). By the mid-1950s, the United States
found itself allied militarily with forty-two states around
the world.
Despite the continued escalation of the Cold War,
hopes for a new era of peaceful coexistence also appeared.
The death of Stalin in 1953 caused some people in the
West to think that the new Soviet leadership might be
more flexible in its policies. But this optimism proved
premature. All talk of rapprochement between East and
West temporarily ceased when the Soviet Union used its
armed forces in 1956 to crush Hungary’s attempt to assert
its independence from Soviet control.
A crisis over Berlin also added to the tension in the
late 1950s. In August 1957, the Soviet Union had
launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM)
and, shortly after, Sputnik I, the first space satellite. Fueled
by partisan political debate, fears of a ‘‘missile gap’’ between the United States and the Soviet Union seized the
American public. Nikita Khrushchev (1894--1971), the
new leader of the Soviet Union, attempted to take advantage of the American frenzy over missiles to solve the
problem of West Berlin. Khrushchev had said that Berlin
was like ‘‘the testicles of the West: every time I want to
make the West scream, I squeeze on Berlin.’’3 West Berlin
had remained a ‘‘Western island’’ of prosperity in the
midst of the relatively poverty-stricken East Germany.
Many East Germans also managed to escape by fleeing to
West Berlin.
In November 1958, Khrushchev announced that
unless the West removed its forces from West Berlin
within six months, he would turn over control of the
access routes to Berlin to the East Germans. Unwilling to
accept an ultimatum that would have abandoned West
Berlin to the Communists, Eisenhower and the West
stood firm, and Khrushchev eventually backed down. In
1961, the East German government built a wall separating
West Berlin from East Berlin, and the Berlin issue faded.
It was revived when John F. Kennedy (1917--1963)
became the U.S. president. During a summit meeting in
Vienna in June 1961, Khrushchev threatened Kennedy
with another six-month ultimatum over West Berlin.
Kennedy left Vienna convinced of the need to deal firmly
with the Soviet Union, and Khrushchev was forced once
again to lift his six-month ultimatum. However, determined to achieve some foreign policy success, the Soviet
leader soon embarked on an even more dangerous adventure in Cuba.
The Cuban Missile Crisis The Cold War confrontation
between the United States and the Soviet Union reached
frightening levels during the Cuban Missile Crisis. In 1959,
a left-wing revolutionary named Fidel Castro (b. 1927)
had overthrown the Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista and
established a Soviet-supported totalitarian regime. In
1961, an American-supported attempt to invade Cuba via
the Bay of Pigs and overthrow Castro’s regime ended in
utter failure. The next year, the Soviet Union decided to
station nuclear missiles in Cuba. The United States was
not prepared to allow nuclear weapons within such close
striking distance of the American mainland, even though
it had placed nuclear weapons in Turkey within easy range
of the Soviet Union. Khrushchev was quick to point out
that ‘‘your rockets are in Turkey. You are worried by
Cuba . . . because it is 90 miles from the American coast.
But Turkey is next to us.’’4 When U.S. intelligence discovered that a Soviet fleet carrying missiles was heading to
Cuba, President Kennedy decided to blockade Cuba and
prevent the fleet from reaching its destination. This approach to the problem had the benefit of delaying confrontation and giving each side time to find a peaceful
solution (see the box on p. 613). Khrushchev agreed to
turn back the fleet if Kennedy pledged not to invade Cuba.
The intense feeling that the world might have been
annihilated in a few days had a profound influence on
both sides. A telephone ‘‘hotline’’ between Moscow and
Washington was installed in 1963 to expedite rapid
communication between the two superpowers in time
of crisis. The same year, both powers agreed to ban nuclear tests in the atmosphere, a step that served to lessen
the tensions between the two nations.
Europe and the World:
Decolonization
Q Focus Question: Why and how did the European
colonies in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia gain
independence between 1945 and 1965?
As noted in Chapter 26, movements for independence had
begun in earnest in Africa and Asia in the years between the
wars. After World War II, these movements gained momentum. The continued subjugation of peoples by colonial
powers seemed at odds with the goals the Allies had pursued in overthrowing the repressive regimes of Germany,
Italy, and Japan. Then, too, indigenous peoples everywhere
took up the call for national self-determination and expressed their determination to fight for independence.
The ending of the colonial European empires, however, was not easy. In 1941, Churchill had said, ‘‘I have not
become His Majesty’s Chief Minister in order to preside
over the liquidation of the British Empire.’’ And both
Britain and France especially seemed reluctant to let go of
their colonies but for a variety of reasons eventually gave
in to the obvious: the days of empire were over.
The power of the European states had been destroyed
by the exhaustive struggles of World War II. The greatest
colonial empire builder, Great Britain, no longer had the
energy or the wealth to maintain its colonial empire after
the war. A rush of decolonization swept the world. Between 1947 and 1962, virtually every colony achieved
independence and attained statehood. Although some
colonial powers willingly relinquished their control,
others had to be driven out by national wars of liberation.
Decolonization was a difficult and even bitter process, but
it created a new geopolitics as the long era of Western
domination of non-Western states ended.
Africa: The Struggle for Independence
After World War II, Europeans reluctantly realized that
colonial rule in Africa would have to come to an end, but
little had been done to prepare Africans for self-rule.
Political organizations that had been formed by Africans
before the war to gain their rights became formal political
parties with independence as their goal. In the Gold
Coast, Kwame Nkrumah formed the Convention People’s
Party, the first African political party in sub-Saharan
Africa. In the late 1940s, Jomo Kenyatta founded the
Kenya African National Union, which focused on economic issues but also sought self-rule for Kenya.
In North Africa, the French granted full independence
to Morocco and Tunisia in 1956 (see Map 28.1). Since
Algeria was home to two million French settlers, however,
France chose to retain its dominion there. But a group of
Algerian nationalists organized the National Liberation
Front (FLN) and in 1954 initiated a guerrilla war to free
their homeland. The French people became so divided over
this war that the French leader, Charles de Gaulle, accepted
the inevitable and granted Algeria independence in 1962.
In areas such as South Africa, where the political
system was dominated by European settlers, the transition
to independence was more complicated. In South Africa,
political activity by local blacks began with the formation
in 1912 of the African National Congress (ANC), whose
goal was to gain economic and political reforms within
the framework of the existing system. The ANC’s efforts,
however, met with little success. At the same time, by the
1950s, South African whites were strengthening the laws
separating whites and blacks, creating a system of racial
segregation in South Africa known as apartheid. When
blacks demonstrated against the apartheid laws, the white
government brutally repressed the demonstrators. After
the arrest of Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, in 1962,
members of the ANC called for
armed resistance to the white
government.
When both the British and the
French decided to let go of their
colonial empires, most black African
nations achieved their independence
in the late 1950s and 1960s. The
Gold Coast, now renamed Ghana
and under the guidance of Kwame
Nkrumah, was first in 1957. Nigeria,
the Belgian Congo (renamed Zaire),
Kenya, Tanganyika (later joined with
Zanzibar and renamed Tanzania),
and others soon followed. Seventeen
new African nations emerged in
1960. Another eleven followed between 1961 and 1965. By the late
1960s, only parts of southern Africa
and the Portuguese possessions of
Mozambique and Angola remained
under European rule. After a series
of brutal guerrilla wars, the Portuguese finally gave up their colonies
in the 1970s.
Conflict in the Middle East
Although Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia,
and Iraq had become independent
states between the two world wars,
the end of World War II led to the
emergence of other independent
states in the Middle East. Jordan,
Syria, and Lebanon, all European
mandates before the war, became
independent (see Map 28.2). Sympathy for the idea of Arab unity
led to the formation of the Arab
League in 1945, but different points
of view among its members prevented it from achieving anything
of substance.
The one issue on which all Muslim states in the area
could agree was the question of Palestine. As tensions
between Jews and Arabs intensified in that mandate during the 1930s, the British reduced Jewish immigration into
the area and firmly rejected Jewish proposals for an independent state in Palestine. The Zionists, who wanted
Palestine as a home for Jews, were not to be denied,
however. Many people had been horrified at the end
of World War II when they learned of the Holocaust,
and sympathy for the Jewish cause grew dramatically.
As a result, the Zionists turned for support to the United
States, and in March 1948, the Truman administration approved the concept of an independent Jewish state in Palestine. When a United Nations resolution divided Palestine
into a Jewish state and an Arab state, the Jews in Palestine
acted. On May 14, 1948, they proclaimed the state of Israel.
To its Arab neighbors, the new state was seen as a
betrayal of the Palestinian people, 90 percent of whom
were Muslim. Outraged at the lack of Western support for
Muslim interests in the area, several Arab countries invaded the new Jewish state. The invasion failed, but both
sides remained bitter. Many of the Arab inhabitants of the
new state fled to surrounding areas, and the Arab states
refused to recognize the existence of Israel.
The growing Arab hostility was a constant threat to
the security of Israel. At a meeting of Arab leaders held in
Jerusalem in 1964, the Egyptians took the lead in forming
the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to represent
the interests of the Palestinians. The PLO believed that
only the Palestinian peoples (and not Jewish immigrants
from abroad) had the right to form a state in Palestine.
During the 1960s, the dispute between Israel and
other states in the Middle East intensified. Fearing an
imminent attack by Arab forces, especially those of Egypt,
Israel launched preemptive air strikes against Egypt and
several of its Arab neighbors on June 5, 1967. During the
Six-Day War, as it came to be called, Israeli forces defeated the Egyptians, seized Jordanian territory on the
West Bank of the Jordan River, and occupied all of
Jerusalem (formerly divided between Israel and Jordan).
Israel tripled the size of its territory. The new Israel
aroused even more bitter hatred among the Arabs. Besides, another million Palestinians now lived inside Israel’s
new borders, most of them in the Gaza Strip and on the
West Bank.
Asia: Nationalism and Communism
In Asia, the United States initiated the process of decolonization in 1946 when it granted independence to the
Philippines (see Map 28.3). Britain soon followed suit with
India. Over the years, Mohandas ‘‘Mahatma’’ Gandhi
(1869--1948) and his civil disobedience movement had
greatly furthered the drive for India’s independence. But
unable to resolve the conflict between the Hindu and
Muslim populations within India, the British created two
states, a mostly Hindu India and a predominantly Muslim
Pakistan, in 1947. In 1948, Britain granted independence
to Ceylon (modern Sri Lanka) and Burma (modern
Myanmar). When the Dutch failed to reestablish control
over the Dutch East Indies, Indonesia emerged as an independent nation in 1949. The French effort to remain in
Indochina led to a bloody struggle with the Vietminh,
Vietnamese nationalist guerrillas, led by Ho Chi Minh, the
Communist and nationalist leader of the Vietnamese. After
their defeat in 1954, the French granted independence to
Laos and Cambodia, and Vietnam was temporarily divided
in anticipation of elections in 1956 that would decide its
fate. But the elections were never held, and the division of
Vietnam into Communist and pro-Western regimes
eventually led to the Vietnam War (see Chapter 29).
China Under Communism At the end of World War II,
two Chinese governments existed side by side. The Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek (1887--1975),
based in southern and central China, was supported by
the Americans. The Communists, under the leadership of
Mao Zedong (1893--1976), had built a strong base in
North China. Their People’s Liberation Army included
nearly one million troops.
When efforts to form a coalition government in 1946
failed, full-scale war between the Nationalists and the
Communists broke out. In the countryside, millions of
peasants were attracted to the Communists by promises
of land, and many joined Mao’s army. By 1948, the
People’s Liberation Army had routed Chiang’s government, and Chiang and two million of his followers fled to
the island of Taiwan, off the coast of mainland China. On
October 1, 1949, Mao mounted the rostrum of the Gate
of Heavenly Peace in Beijing and made a victory statement to the thousands gathered in the square before him.
The Chinese people have stood up, he said, and no one
will be able to humiliate us again.
The newly victorious Communist Party, under the
leadership of its chairman, Mao, had a long-term goal of
building a socialist society. In 1955, the Chinese government collectivized all private farmland and nationalized
most industry and commerce. Mao then embarked on a
more radical program known as the Great Leap Forward
in 1958. Existing collective farms, normally the size of the
traditional village, were combined into vast ‘‘people’s
communes,’’ each containing more than thirty thousand
people. Mao hoped this program would mobilize the
people for a massive effort to speed up economic growth
and reach the final stage of communism---the classless
society---before the end of the twentieth century. But the
Great Leap Forward was a disaster. Bad weather and
peasant hatred of the new system combined to drive food
production downward. Nevertheless, despite his failures,
Mao was not yet ready to abandon his dream of a totally
classless society, and in 1966 he launched China on a new
forced march toward communism (see Chapter 29).
Recovery and Renewal in Europe
Q Focus Question: What were the main developments in
the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and Western Europe
between 1945 and 1965?
Just a few years after the defeat of Germany and Italy in
World War II, economic revival brought renewed growth
to European society, although major differences remained
between Western and Eastern Europe.
The Soviet Union: From Stalin to Khrushchev
World War II devastated the Soviet Union. To create a
new industrial base, Stalin returned to the method that he
had used in the 1930s---the acquisition of development
capital from Soviet labor. Working hard for little pay,
poor housing, and precious few consumer goods, Soviet
laborers were expected to produce articles for export that
they themselves could not even afford. The incoming
capital from abroad could then be used to purchase
machinery and Western technology. The loss of millions
of men in the war meant that much of this tremendous
workload fell on Soviet women. Almost 40 percent of
heavy manual labor was performed by women.
Economic recovery in the Soviet Union was nothing
less than spectacular. By 1947, Russian industrial production had attained prewar levels; three years later, it
had surpassed them by 40 percent. New power plants,
canals, and giant factories were built, and new industrial
plants and oil fields were established in Siberia and Soviet
Central Asia.
Stalin’s Policies Although Stalin’s economic policy
was successful in promoting growth in heavy industry,
primarily for the benefit of the military, consumer goods
were scarce. The development of thermonuclear weapons
in 1953, MIG fighter planes from 1950 to 1953, and the
first space satellite in 1957 may have elevated the Soviet
state’s reputation as a world power abroad, but domestically the Russian people were shortchanged. Heavy
industry grew at a rate three times that of personal consumption. Moreover, the housing shortage was acute.
A British military attache´ in Moscow reported that ‘‘all
houses, practically without exception, show lights from
every window after dark. This seems to indicate that every
room is both a living room by day and a bedroom by
night. There is no place in overcrowded Moscow for the
luxury of eating and sleeping in separate rooms.’’5
When World War II ended in 1945, Stalin had been
in power for more than fifteen years. During that time,
he had removed all opposition to his rule and remained
the undisputed master of the Soviet Union. Stalin’s
morbid suspicions fueled the constantly increasing repression that was a characteristic of his regime. In 1946,
the government decreed that all literary and scientific
works must conform to the political needs of the state.
Along with this anti-intellectual campaign came political
terror. A new series of purges seemed imminent in 1953,
but Stalin’s death on March 5, 1953, prevented more
bloodletting.
Khrushchev’s Rule A new collective leadership succeeded Stalin until Nikita Khrushchev emerged as the chief
Soviet policy maker. Khrushchev had been responsible for
ending the system of forced-labor camps, a regular feature
of Stalinist Russia. At the Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party in 1956, Khrushchev condemned Stalin for his
‘‘administrative violence, mass repression, and terror.’’
Once in power, Khrushchev took steps to undo some
of the worst features of Stalin’s repressive regime. A certain degree of intellectual freedom was now permitted;
Khrushchev said that ‘‘readers should be given the chance
to make their own judgments’’ regarding the acceptability
of controversial literature and that ‘‘police measures
shouldn’t be used.’’6 In 1962, he allowed the publication
of Alexander Solzhenitsyn’s novel A Day in the Life of Ivan
Denisovich, a grim portrayal of the horrors of Russia’s
forced-labor camps. Most important, Khrushchev extended the process of destalinization by reducing the
powers of the secret police and closing some of the Siberian prison camps. Nevertheless, Khrushchev’s revelations about Stalin at the Twentieth Congress caused
turmoil in Communist ranks everywhere and encouraged
a spirit of rebellion in Soviet satellite countries in Eastern
Europe. Soviet troops reacted by crushing an uprising in
Hungary in 1956, and Khrushchev and the Soviet leaders,
fearful of further undermining the basic foundations of
the regime, downplayed their campaign of destalinization.
Economically, Khrushchev tried to place
more emphasis on light industry and consumer goods. Khrushchev’s attempts to increase agricultural output by cultivating vast
lands east of the Ural Mountains proved less
successful and damaged his reputation within
the Party. These failures, combined with increased military spending, hurt the Soviet
economy. The annual rate of industrial
growth, which had soared in the early 1950s,
now declined dramatically from 13 percent in
1953 to 7.5 percent in 1964.
Khrushchev’s personality also did not
endear him to the higher Soviet officials,
who frowned at his tendency to crack jokes
and play the clown. Foreign policy failures
caused additional damage to Khrushchev’s
reputation among his colleagues. His rash
plan to place missiles in Cuba was the final
straw. While he was on vacation in 1964, a
special meeting of the Soviet Politburo
voted him out of office (because of ‘‘deteriorating health’’) and forced him into
retirement. Although a group of leaders
succeeded him, real power came into the
hands of Leonid Brezhnev (1906--1982), the
‘‘trusted’’ supporter of Khrushchev who had engineered
his downfall.
Eastern Europe: Behind the Iron Curtain
At the end of World War II, Soviet military forces remained in all the lands they had liberated from the Nazis in
Eastern Europe and the Balkans except for Greece, Albania,
and Yugoslavia. All of the occupied states came to be part
of the Soviet sphere of influence and, after 1945, experienced similar political developments. Between 1945 and
1947, one-party Communist governments became firmly
entrenched in East Germany, Bulgaria, Romania, Poland,
and Hungary. In Czechoslovakia, where there was a strong
tradition of democratic institutions, the Communists did
not achieve their goals until 1948 when all other parties
were dissolved and Klement Gottwald, the leader of the
Communists, became the new president of Czechoslovakia.
Albania and Yugoslavia were notable exceptions to this
progression of Soviet dominance in Eastern Europe. Both
had had strong Communist resistance movements during
the war, and in both countries, the Communist Party
simply assumed power when the war ended. In Albania,
local Communists established a rigidly Stalinist regime that
grew increasingly independent of the Soviet Union.
In Yugoslavia, Josip Broz, known as Tito (1892--
1980), leader of the Communist resistance movement,
seemed to be a loyal Stalinist. After the war, however, he
moved toward the establishment of an independent
Communist state in Yugoslavia. In 1958, the Yugoslav
party congress asserted that Yugoslav Communists would
pursue a more decentralized economic and political system in which workers could manage themselves and local
communes could exercise some political power.
Between 1948 and Stalin’s death in 1953, the Eastern
European satellite states followed a policy of Stalinization.
They instituted Soviet-type five-year plans with an emphasis on heavy industry rather than consumer goods.
They began to collectivize agriculture. They established
the institutions of repression---secret police and military
forces. But communism---a foreign product---had not developed deep roots among the peoples of Eastern Europe.
Moreover, Soviet economic exploitation of Eastern
Europe made living conditions harsh for most people.
1956: Upheaval in Eastern Europe After Stalin’s
death, many Eastern European states began to pursue a
more nationalistically oriented course while the new
Soviet leaders, including Khrushchev, interfered less in
the internal affairs of their satellites. But in the late
1950s, the Soviet Union also made it clear, particularly
in Poland and Hungary, that it would not allow its
Eastern European satellites to become independent of
Soviet control.
In 1956, worker protests erupted in Poland. In response, the Polish Communist Party adopted a series of
reforms in October and elected Wladyslaw Gomulka
(1905--1982) as first secretary. Gomulka declared that
Poland had the right to follow its own socialist path.
Fearful of Soviet armed response, however, the Poles
compromised. Poland pledged to remain loyal to the
Warsaw Pact, and the Soviets agreed to allow Poland to
follow its own path to socialism.
The developments in Poland in 1956 inspired national Communists in Hungary to seek the same kinds
of reforms and independence. Intense debates eventually
resulted in the ouster of the ruling Stalinist and the selection of Imre Nagy (1896--1958) as the new Hungarian
leader. Internal dissent, however, was not directed simply against the Soviets but against communism in general, which was viewed as a creation of the Soviets, not
the Hungarians. The Stalinist secret police had also bred
much terror and hatred. This dissatisfaction, combined
with economic difficulties, created a situation ripe for
revolt. To quell the rising rebellion, Nagy declared
Hungary a free nation on November 1, 1956. He
promised free elections, and the mood of the country
made it clear that this could mean the end of Communist rule in Hungary. But Khrushchev was in no
position at home to allow a member of the Communist
flock to leave. Just three days after Nagy’s declaration,
the Red Army attacked Budapest (see the box on p. 620).
The Soviets reestablished control over the country while
Ja´nos Ka´da´r (1912--1989), a reform-minded cabinet
minister, replaced Nagy. By collaborating with the Soviet
invaders, Ka´da´r saved many of Nagy’s economic reforms.
The developments in Poland and Hungary in 1956 discouraged any similar upheavals elsewhere in Eastern
Europe.
Western Europe: The Revival of Democracy
and the Economy
Thanks to the economic aid of the Marshall Plan, the
countries of Western Europe recovered relatively rapidly
from the devastation of World War II. Between 1947 and
1950, European countries received $9.4 billion to be used
for new equipment and raw materials. By 1950, industrial output in Europe was 30 percent above prewar
levels. And this economic recovery continued well into
the 1950s and 1960s, both decades of dramatic economic
growth and prosperity in Western Europe. Indeed,
Western Europe experienced virtually full employment
during these decades.
France: The Domination of de Gaulle The history of
France for nearly a quarter century after the war was
dominated by one man---Charles de Gaulle (1890--
1970)---who possessed an unshakable faith that he had a
historical mission to reestablish the greatness of the
French nation. De Gaulle had played an important role
in ensuring the establishment of a French provisional
government after the war. The declaration of the Fourth
Republic, with a return to a parliamentary system based
on parties that de Gaulle considered weak, led him to
withdraw from politics. Eventually, he formed the French
Popular Movement, a decidedly rightist organization,
which called for an even stronger presidency, a goal that
de Gaulle finally achieved in 1958.
The fragile political stability of the Fourth Republic
had been badly shaken by the Algerian crisis. The French
army had suffered defeat in Indochina in 1954 and was
determined to resist Algerian demands for independence. But a strong antiwar movement among French
intellectuals and church leaders led to bitter divisions
within France that opened the door to the possibility of
civil war. The panic-stricken leaders of the Fourth Republic offered to let de Gaulle take over the government
and revise the constitution.
In 1958, de Gaulle immediately drafted a new constitution for the Fifth Republic that greatly enhanced the
power of the office of president, who now had the right
to choose the prime minister, dissolve parliament, and
supervise both defense and foreign policy. As the new
president, de Gaulle sought to return France to the position of a great power. He believed that playing a pivotal
role in the Cold War might enhance France’s stature. For
that reason, he pulled France out of the NATO high
command. With an eye toward achieving the status of a
world power, de Gaulle invested heavily in the nuclear
arms race. France exploded its first nuclear bomb in
1960. Despite his successes, de Gaulle did not really
achieve his ambitious goals of world power. Although
his successors maintained that France was the ‘‘third
nuclear power’’ after the United States and the Soviet
Union, in truth France was too small for such global
ambitions.
Although the cost of the nuclear program increased
the defense budget, de Gaulle did not neglect the French
economy. Economic decision making was centralized.
Between 1958 and 1968, the French gross domestic
product experienced an annual increase of 5.5 percent,
greater than that of the United States. By the end of de
Gaulle’s era, France was a major industrial producer and
exporter, particularly in such areas as automobiles and
armaments. Nevertheless, problems remained. The expansion of traditional industries, such as coal, steel, and
railroads, which had all been nationalized (put under
government ownership), led to large government deficits.
The cost of living increased faster in France than in the
rest of Europe.
Increased dissatisfaction with the inability of de
Gaulle’s government to deal with these problems soon
led to more violent action. In May 1968, a series of
student protests, followed by a general strike by the labor
unions, shook the government. Although de Gaulle
managed to restore order, the events of May 1968 had
seriously undermined the French people’s respect for
their aloof and imperious president. Tired and discouraged, de Gaulle resigned from office in April 1969 and
died within a year.
West Germany: A Nation Reborn As a result of the
pressures of the Cold War, the unification of the three
western zones into the Federal Republic of Germany became a reality in 1949. Konrad Adenauer (1876--1967),
the leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU)
who served as chancellor from 1949 to 1963, became the
‘‘founding hero’’ of the Federal Republic. Adenauer
sought respect for West Germany by cooperating with the
United States and the other Western European nations.
He was especially desirous of reconciliation with France---
Germany’s longtime enemy. The beginning of the Korean
War in June 1950 had unexpected repercussions for West
Germany. The fear that South Korea might fall to the
Communist forces of the North led many Germans and
Westerners to worry about the security of West Germany
and led to calls for the rearmament of West Germany.
Although many people, concerned about a revival of
German militarism, condemned this proposal, Cold War
tensions were decisive. West Germany rearmed in 1955
and became a member of NATO.
Adenauer’s chancellorship is associated with the resurrection of the West German economy, often referred
to as the ‘‘economic miracle.’’ It was largely guided by
the minister of finance, Ludwig Erhard. Although West
Germany had only 75 percent of the population and
52 percent of the territory of prewar Germany, by 1955 the
West German gross domestic product exceeded that of
prewar Germany. Real wages doubled between 1950 and
1965 even though work hours were cut by 20 percent.
Unemployment fell from 8 percent in 1950 to 0.4 percent
in 1965. To maintain its economic expansion, West
Germany even imported hundreds of thousands of guest
workers, primarily from Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, and
Yugoslavia.
Adenauer resigned in 1963, after fourteen years of
firmly guiding West Germany through its postwar recovery. Adenauer had wanted no grand experimentation
at home or abroad; he was content to give Germany
time to regain its equilibrium. Ludwig Erhard succeeded
Adenauer and largely continued his policies. But an
economic downturn in the mid-1960s opened the door to
the rise of the Social Democrats, which in 1969 became
the leading party.
Great Britain: The Welfare State The end of World
War II left Britain with massive economic problems.
In elections held immediately after the war, the Labour
Party overwhelmingly defeated Churchill’s Conservatives.
Labour had promised far-reaching reforms, particularly in
the area of social welfare, and in a country with a tremendous shortage of consumer goods and housing, its
platform was quite appealing. The new Labour government, with Clement Atlee (1883--1967) as prime minister,
proceeded to enact reforms that created a modern welfare
state.
The establishment of the British welfare state began
with the nationalization of the Bank of England, the coal
and steel industries, public transportation, and public
utilities, such as electricity and gas. In the area of social
welfare, the new government enacted the National Insurance Act and the National Health Service Act in 1946.
The insurance act established a comprehensive social
security program and nationalized medical insurance,
thereby enabling the state to subsidize the unemployed,
the sick, and the aged. The health act created a system of
socialized medicine that forced doctors and dentists to
work with state hospitals, although private practices
could be maintained. This measure was especially costly
for the state, but within a few years, 90 percent of medical
professionals were participating. The British welfare
state became the model for most European states after
the war.
The cost of building a welfare state at home forced
the British to reduce expenses abroad. This meant the
dismantling of the British Empire and the reduction of
military aid to such countries as Greece and Turkey. It
was not a belief in the morality of self-determination but
economic necessity that brought an end to the British
Empire.
Continuing economic problems brought the Conservatives back into power from 1951 to 1964. Although
they favored private enterprise, the Conservatives accepted the welfare state and even extended it when they
undertook an ambitious construction program to improve British housing. Although the British economy had
recovered from the war, it had done so at a slower rate
than other European countries. Moreover, the slow rate of
recovery masked a long-term economic decline caused by
a variety of factors. The demands of British trade unions
for wages that rose faster than productivity were a
problem in the 1950s and 1960s. The unwillingness of the
British to invest in modern industrial machinery and to
adopt new methods also did not help. Underlying the
immediate problems, however, was a deeper issue. As a
result of World War II, Britain had lost much of its
prewar revenues from abroad but was left with a burden
of debt from its many international commitments. At the
same time, with the rise of the United States and the
Soviet Union, Britain’s ability to play the role of a world
power declined substantially.
Western Europe: The Move Toward Unity
As noted, the divisions created by the Cold War led the
nations of Western Europe to form the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization in 1949. But the destructiveness of
two world wars caused many thoughtful Europeans to
consider the need for some form of European unity beyond the military. National feeling was still too powerful
for European nations to give up their political sovereignty, so the desire for a sense of solidarity came to focus
primarily on the economic arena.
In 1951, France, West Germany, the Benelux
countries (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg),
and Italy formed the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). Its purpose was to create a common
market for coal and steel products among the six
nations by eliminating tariffs and other trade barriers.
The success of the
ECSC encouraged
its members to
proceed further, and
in 1957 they signed
the Treaty of Rome,
which created the
European Economic
Community (EEC),
also known as the
Common Market.
The EEC eliminated customs barriers for the six
member nations and
created a large freetrade area protected
from the rest of the
world by a common external tariff. By promoting free trade, the EEC also
encouraged cooperation and standardization in many
aspects of the six nations’ economies. All the member
nations benefited economically. With a total population
of 165 million, the EEC became the world’s largest exporter and purchaser of raw materials. Only the United
States surpassed the EEC in steel production.
The United States and Canada:
A New Era
Q Focus Question: What were the main political
developments in North America between 1945 and
1965?
At the end of World War II, the United States emerged as
one of the world’s two superpowers. As the Cold War
with the Soviet Union intensified, the United States
worked hard to prevent the spread of communism
throughout the world. American domestic political life
after 1945 was played out against a background of U.S.
military power abroad.

American Politics and Society in the 1950s
For two decades after 1945, the ideals of Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal largely determined the patterns of
American domestic politics. The New Deal had brought
basic changes to American society. These included a
dramatic increase in the role and power of the federal
government, the rise of organized labor as a significant
force in the economy and politics, the beginning of a
welfare state, and a grudging realization of the need to
deal fairly with the concerns of minorities.
The New Deal tradition in American politics was
bolstered by the election of Democratic presidents---Harry
Truman in 1948, John Kennedy in 1960, and Lyndon
Johnson in 1964. Even the election of a Republican
president, Dwight Eisenhower, in 1952 and 1956 did not
change the basic direction of the New Deal. As Eisenhower stated, ‘‘Should any political party attempt to
abolish Social Security and eliminate labor laws and farm
programs, you would not hear of that party again in our
political history.’’
The economic boom after World War II fueled
confidence in the American way of life. A shortage of
consumer goods during the war left Americans with both
extra income and the desire to buy those goods after the
war. Then, too, the growth of labor unions brought
higher wages and gave more and more workers the ability
to buy consumer goods. After 1945, real wages grew an
average of 3 percent a year, the most prolonged advance
in American history.
Prosperity was not the only characteristic of the
early 1950s. Cold War confrontations abroad had repercussions at home. The takeover of China by Mao
Zedong’s Communist forces in 1949 and Communist
North Korea’s invasion of South Korea in 1950 led to a
fear that Communists had infiltrated America. President
Truman’s attorney general warned that Communists ‘‘are
everywhere---in factories, offices, butcher stores, on street
corners, in private businesses. And each carried in himself
the germ of death for society.’’ A demagogic senator from
Wisconsin, Joseph R. McCarthy, helped intensify a massive ‘‘Red Scare’’ with his expose´s of supposed Communists in high government positions. McCarthy went too
far when he attacked alleged ‘‘Communist conspirators’’
in the United States Army and was censured by Congress
in 1954. Very quickly, his anti-Communist crusade came
to an end.
An Age of Upheaval: America in the 1960s
Starting in the 1960s, the United States experienced a
period of upheaval that brought to the fore problems that
had been glossed over in the 1950s. The 1960s began on a
youthful and optimistic note. At age forty-three, John F.
Kennedy became the youngest president in the history of
the United States. His administration, focused primarily
on foreign affairs, was cut short by an assassin’s bullet
on November 22, 1963. Kennedy’s successor, Lyndon
B. Johnson, who won a new term as president in a landslide in 1964, used his stunning mandate to pursue what
he called the Great Society, heir to the welfare state first
begun in the New Deal. Johnson’s programs included
health care for the elderly, a ‘‘war on poverty’’ to be fought
with food stamps and a ‘‘job corps,’’ a new Department of
Housing and Urban Development to deal with the problems of the cities, and federal assistance for education.
The Civil Rights Movement Johnson’s other domestic
passion was equal rights for African Americans. The civil
rights movement had its beginnings in 1954 when the
United States Supreme Court took the dramatic step of
striking down the practice of racial segregation in public
schools. The eloquent Martin Luther King Jr. (1929--
1968) became the leader of a growing movement for racial equality, and by the early 1960s, a number of groups,
including King’s Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), were organizing sit-ins and demonstrations
across the South to end racial segregation. In August
1963, King led the March on Washington for Jobs and
Freedom to dramatize black Americans’ desire for equal
treatment under the law. This march and King’s impassioned plea for racial equality had an electrifying effect on
the American people.
President Johnson took up the cause of civil rights.
As a result of his initiative, Congress passed the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, which created the machinery to end
segregation and discrimination in the workplace and all
public places. A voting rights act the following year made
it easier for nonwhites to vote in southern states. But laws
alone could not guarantee the Great Society, and Johnson
soon faced bitter social unrest, both from African
Americans and from the burgeoning movement opposing
the Vietnam War.
African Americans had officially had voting rights
for many years, but local patterns of segregation led to
higher unemployment rates for blacks than for whites
and left blacks segregated in urban ghettos. In these
ghettos, the calls for action by radical black leaders, such
as Malcolm X of the Black Muslims, attracted more attention than the nonviolent appeals of Martin Luther
King. In the summer of 1965, race riots broke out in
the Watts district of Los Angeles. Thirty-four people
died and over one thousand buildings were destroyed.
Cleveland, San Francisco, Chicago, Newark, and Detroit
exploded in the summers of 1966 and 1967. The riots led
to a ‘‘white backlash’’ and a severe division of America.

The Development of Canada
Canada experienced many of the same developments that
the United States did in the postwar years. For twenty-five
years after World War II, a prosperous Canada set out on
a new path of industrial development. Canada had always
had a strong export economy based on its abundant
natural resources. Now it developed electronic, aircraft,
nuclear, and chemical engineering industries as well on a
large scale. Much of the Canadian growth, however, was
financed by capital from the United States, which led to
American ownership of Canadian businesses. Although
many Canadians welcomed the economic growth, others
feared American economic domination of Canada.
Canadians also worried about playing a secondary role
politically and militarily to its neighboring superpower.
Canadians agreed to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1949 and even sent military forces to fight in
Korea the following year. But to avoid subordination to the
United States, Canada actively supported the United Nations. Nevertheless, concerns about the United States did
not keep Canada from maintaining a special relationship
with its southern neighbor. The North American Air Defense Command (NORAD), formed in 1957, was based on
close cooperation between the air forces of the two countries for the defense of North America against missile attack.
After 1945, the Liberal Party continued to dominate
Canadian politics until 1957, when John Diefenbaker
(1895--1979) achieved a Conservative Party victory. But
major economic problems returned the Liberals to power,
and under Lester Pearson (1897--1972), they created
Canada’s welfare state by enacting a national social security system (the Canada Pension Plan) and a national
health insurance program.
Postwar Society and Culture
in the Western World
Q Focus Question: What major changes occurred in
Western society and culture between 1945 and 1965?
During the postwar era, Western society and culture
witnessed remarkably rapid change. Computers, television, jet planes, contraceptive devices, and new surgical
techniques all dramatically and quickly altered the pace
and nature of human life. The rapid changes in postwar
society, fueled by scientific advances and rapid economic
growth, led many to view it as a new society.
The Structure of European Society
The structure of European society was altered after 1945.
Especially noticeable were the changes in the middle class.
Such traditional middle-class groups as businesspeople
and professionals in law, medicine, and the universities
were joined by a new group of managers and technicians
as large companies and government agencies employed
increasing numbers of white-collar supervisory and administrative personnel. Whether in Eastern or Western
Europe, the new managers and experts were very much
alike. Everywhere their positions depended on specialized
knowledge acquired from some form of higher education.
Because their positions usually depended on their skills,
they took steps to ensure that their own children would
be educated.
Changes also occurred among the traditional lower
classes. Especially noticeable was the dramatic shift of
people from rural to urban areas. The number of people
engaged in agriculture declined drastically; by the 1950s,
the number of farmers throughout most of Europe had
dropped by 50 percent. Nor did the size of the industrial
working class expand. In West Germany, industrial workers
made up 48 percent of the labor force throughout the
1950s and 1960s. Thereafter, the number of industrial
workers began to dwindle as the number of white-collar
service employees increased. At the same time, a substantial increase in their real wages enabled the working classes
to aspire to the consumption patterns of the middle class,
leading to what some observers have called the ‘‘consumer
society.’’ Buying on the installment plan, introduced in the
1930s, became widespread beginning in the 1950s and gave
workers a chance to imitate the middle class by buying
such products as televisions, washing machines, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, and stereos. But the most
visible symbol of mass consumerism was the automobile.
Before World War II, cars were reserved mostly for the
European upper classes. In 1948, there were 5 million cars
in all of Europe, but by 1957, the number had tripled. By
the 1960s, there were almost 45 million cars.
Rising incomes, combined with shorter working
hours, created an even greater market for mass leisure
activities. Between 1900 and 1960, the workweek was
reduced from sixty hours to about forty, and the number
of paid holidays increased. All aspects of popular culture---music, sports, media---became commercialized and
offered opportunities for leisure activities, including
concerts, sporting events, and television viewing.
Another very visible symbol of mass leisure was the
growth of tourism. Before World War II, mostly the upper and middle classes traveled for pleasure. After the war,
the combination of more vacation time, increased prosperity, and the flexibility provided by package tours, with
their lower rates and budget-priced rooms, enabled millions to expand their travel possibilities. By the mid-
1960s, some 100 million tourists were crossing European
boundaries each year.
Women in the Postwar Western World
Despite their enormous contributions to the war effort,
women at the end of World War II were removed from the
workforce to provide jobs for the soldiers returning home.
After the horrors and separations of the war, people
seemed willing for a while to return to traditional family
life. Female participation in the workforce declined, and
birthrates began to rise, creating a ‘‘baby boom.’’ This
increase in the birthrate, however, did not last, and the size
of families began to decline by the end of the 1950s.
Largely responsible for this decline was the widespread
practice of birth control. Invented in the nineteenth century, the condom was already in wide use, but the development in the 1960s of oral contraceptives, known as
birth control pills (or simply ‘‘the pill’’), provided an effective means of birth control that quickly spread to all
Western countries.
Women in the Workforce The trend toward smaller
families contributed to the change in the nature of
women’s employment in both Europe and the United
States as women spent considerably more years not
involved in rearing children. The most important development was the increased number of married women
in the workforce. At the beginning of the twentieth
century, even working-class wives tended to stay at
home if they could afford to do so. In the postwar period, this was no longer the case. In the United States,
for example, in 1900, married women made up about
15 percent of the female labor force; by 1970, their
number had increased to 62 percent. The percentage of
married women in the female labor force in Europe
showed similar increases.
But the greater number of women in the workforce
did not change some old patterns. Working-class women
in particular still earned salaries lower than those of men
for equal work. In the 1960s, women earned only
60 percent of men’s wages in Britain, 50 percent in France,
and 63 percent in West Germany. In addition, women still
tended to enter traditionally female jobs. Many European
women also still faced the double burden of earning income on the one hand and raising a family and maintaining the household on the other.
Suffrage and the Search for Liberation The participation of women in World Wars I and II helped them
achieve one of the major aims of the nineteenth-century
feminist movement---the right to vote. After World War I,
many governments acknowledged the contributions of
women to the war effort by granting them suffrage, although women in France and Italy did not obtain the vote
until 1945. After World War II, European women tended
to fall back into the traditional roles expected of them,
and little was heard of feminist concerns.
A women’s liberation movement would arise in the
late 1960s (see Chapter 29), but much of the theoretical
foundation for the emergence of the postwar women’s
liberation movement was evident in the earlier work of
Simone de Beauvoir (1908--1986). Born into a Catholic
middle-class family and educated at the Sorbonne in
Paris, she supported herself as a teacher and later as a
writer. She maintained a lifelong relationship (but not
marriage) with the existentialist writer Jean-Paul Sartre
and became actively involved in political causes. De
Beauvoir believed that she lived a ‘‘liberated’’ life for a
twentieth-century European woman, but for all her
freedom, she still came to perceive that as a woman she
faced limits that men did not. In 1949, she published her
highly influential work, The Second Sex, in which she
argued that as a result of male-dominated societies,
women had been defined by their differences from men
and consequently received second-class status. De Beauvoir took an active role in the French women’s movement
of the 1970s, and her book was a major influence on the
feminist movement on both sides of the Atlantic (see the
box above).
Postwar Art
Following the war, the United States dominated the art
world. New York City replaced Paris as the artistic center
of the West. The Guggenheim Museum, the Museum of
Modern Art, and the Whitney Museum of Modern Art,
together with New York’s numerous art galleries, promoted modern art and helped determine artistic tastes
throughout much of the world. One of the styles that
became synonymous with the emergence of the New York
art scene was Abstract Expressionism.
Dubbed ‘‘action painting’’ by one critic, Abstract
Expressionism was energetic and spontaneous, qualities
evident in the enormous canvases of Jackson Pollock
(1912--1956). In such works as Lavender Mist (1950),
paint seems to explode, enveloping the viewer with
emotion and movement. Pollock’s swirling forms and
seemingly chaotic patterns broke all conventions of form
and structure. His drip paintings, with their total abstraction, were extremely influential with other artists,
and he eventually became a celebrity. Inspired by Native
American sand painters, Pollock painted with the canvas
on the floor. He explained, ‘‘On the floor I am more at
ease. I feel nearer, more a part of the painting, since this
way I can walk around in, work from four sides and be
literally in the painting. When I am in the painting, I am
not aware of what I am doing. There is pure harmony.’’
The early 1960s saw the emergence of Pop Art, which
took images of popular culture and transformed them
into works of fine art. Andy Warhol (1930--1987), who
began as an advertising illustrator, was the most famous
of the Pop artists. Warhol adapted images from commercial art, such as Campbell’s soup cans, and photographs of such celebrities as Marilyn Monroe.
Postwar Literature
In postwar literature, the most significant new trend
was called the Theater of the Absurd. Its most famous
proponent was the Irishman Samuel Beckett (1906--
1990), who lived in France. In Beckett’s Waiting for
Godot (1952), two men wait for the appearance of
someone with whom they may or may not have an
appointment. No background information on the two
men is provided. During the course of the play, the men
talk, but nothing seems to happen. The audience is
never told if what they see in front of them is real or
imagined. Unlike traditional theater, suspense is maintained by having the audience wonder not ‘‘What is
going to happen next?’’ but simply ‘‘What is happening
now?’’
The sense of meaninglessness that inspired the Theater of the Absurd also underscored the philosophy of
existentialism of Albert Camus (1913--1960) and JeanPaul Sartre (1905--1980). The central point of the existentialism of Sartre and Camus was the absence of God in
the universe. Though the death of God was tragic, it
meant that humans had no preordained destiny and were
utterly alone in the universe, with no future and no hope.
As Camus expressed it:
A world that can be explained even with bad reasons is a
familiar world. But, on the other hand, in a universe suddenly divested of illusions and lights, man feels an alien, a
stranger. His exile is without remedy since he is deprived
of the memory of a lost home or the hope of a promised
land. This divorce between man and his life, the actor and
his setting, is properly the feeling of absurdity.7
According to Camus, then, the world was absurd and
without meaning; humans, too, are without meaning
and purpose. Reduced to despair and depression, humans have but one source of hope---themselves.
The Revival of Religion
Existentialism was one response to the despair generated
by the apparent collapse of civilized values in the twentieth century. The revival of religion was another. Ever
since the Enlightenment of the eighteenth century,
Christianity and religion had been on the defensive. But a
number of religious thinkers and leaders attempted to
bring new life to Christianity in the twentieth century.
One expression of this religious revival was the
attempt by the Protestant theologian Karl Barth (1886--
1968) to infuse traditional Christian teachings with new
life. In his numerous writings, Barth attempted to reinterpret the religious insights of the Reformation era
for the modern world. To Barth, the sinful and hence
imperfect nature of human beings meant that humans
could know religious truth not through reason but only
through the grace of God.
In the Catholic church, an attempt at religious renewal also came from a charismatic pope. Pope John
XXIII (1881--1963) reigned as pope for only a short time
(1958--1963) but sparked a dramatic revival of Catholicism when he summoned the twenty-first ecumenical
council of the Catholic church. Known as Vatican II, the
council liberalized a number of Catholic practices. For
example, the liturgy of the Mass, the central feature of
Catholic worship, was now to be spoken in the vernacular,
not in Latin.
The Explosion of Popular Culture
Since World War II, popular culture has played an increasingly important role in helping Western people define themselves. The history of popular culture is also the
history of the economic system that supports it, for this
system manufactures, distributes, and sells the images
that people consume as part of their culture. As popular
culture and its economic support system became increasingly intertwined, industries of leisure emerged. As
one historian of popular culture has argued, ‘‘Industrial
societies turn the provision of leisure into a commercial
activity, in which their citizens are sold entertainment,
recreation, pleasure, and appearance as commodities that
differ from the goods at the drugstore only in the way
they are used.’’8 Modern popular culture is therefore inextricably tied to the mass consumer society in which it
emerged.
Popular Culture and the Americanization of the
World The United States has been the most influential
force in shaping popular culture in the West and, to a
lesser degree, the rest of the world. Through movies,
music, advertising, and television, the United States has
spread its particular form of consumerism and the
American dream to millions around the world. Already in
1923, the New York Morning Post noted that ‘‘the film is
to America what the flag was once to Britain. By its means
Uncle Sam may hope some day . . . to Americanize the
world.’’9 In movies, television, and music, the impact of
American popular culture on the Western world was
pervasive.
Motion pictures were the primary vehicle for the
diffusion of American popular culture in the years immediately following the war, and they continued to
dominate both European and American markets in the
next decades. Although developed in the 1930s, television
did not become readily available until the late 1940s. By
1954, there were 32 million sets in the United States as
television became the centerpiece of middle-class life.
In the 1960s, as television spread around the world,
American networks sold their products in Europe and the
Third World at extraordinarily low prices. The United
States also dominated popular music. Jazz, blues,
rhythm and blues, and rock-and-roll became the
most popular music forms in the Western world---and
much of the non-Western world---in the decades after
World War II. All of them originated in the United States,
and all are rooted in African American musical innovations. As these forms spread to the rest of the world,
they inspired local artists, who then transformed the
music in their own ways.

CONCLUSION
At the end of a devastating world war, a new kind of conflict
erupted in the Western world as two of the victors, the United States
and the Soviet Union, emerged as superpowers and began to argue
over the political organization of a Europe liberated from Nazi
Germany. Europeans, whether they wanted to or not, were forced
to become supporters of one side or the other. The Western world
was soon divided between supporters of the capitalist West and
adherents of the Communist East. Western Europe emerged as a
new community in the 1950s and the 1960s and staged a remarkable
economic recovery, while Eastern Europe seemed to stagnate under
the thumb of the Soviet Union. Regardless of their economic
differences, however, both Western and Eastern Europeans were well
aware that their future hung in the balance of the Cold War conflict
between the two superpowers.
The postwar era was also characterized by decolonization.
After World War II, the colonial empires of the European
states were largely dissolved, and the liberated territories of
Africa, Asia, and the Middle East emerged as sovereign states.
All too soon, most of these newly independent nations found
themselves caught up in the Cold War rivalry between the United
States and the Soviet Union. After the United States fought in
Korea to prevent the spread of communism, the ideological
division that had begun in Europe quickly spread to the rest
of the world.
