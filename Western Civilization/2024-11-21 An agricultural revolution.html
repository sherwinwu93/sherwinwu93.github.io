<h2 id="org578bbe5">2024-11-21 An agricultural revolution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org578bbe5">
<p class="verse">
The biggest change was the shift<br />
&#xa0;from hunting animals and gathering plants for sustenance (food gathering)<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;to producing food by systematic agriculture (food production).<br />
The planting of grains and vegetables provided a regular supply of food,<br />
&#xa0;while the domestication of animals, such as sheep, goats, cattle, and pigs,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;added a steady source of meat, milk, and fibers such as wool for clothing.<br />
Larger animals could also be used as beasts of burden.<br />
The growing of crops and the taming of food-producing animals<br />
&#xa0;created a new relationship between humans and nature.<br />
Historians speak of this as an agricultural revolution.<br />
Revolutionary change is dramatic and requires great effort,<br />
&#xa0;but the ability to acquire food on a regular basis<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;gave humans greater control over their environment.<br />
It also allowed them to give up their nomadic ways of life and begin to live in settled communities.<br />
<br />
Systematic agriculture probably developed independently<br />
&#xa0;between 8000 and 7000 B.C. in various parts of the world.<br />
Different plants were cultivated in each:<br />
&#xa0;wheat, barley, and lentils in the Near East; rice and millet in southern Asia;<br />
&#xa0;millet and yams in western Africa; and beans, potatoes, and corn in the Americas.<br />
The Neolithic agricultural revolution needed a favorable environment.<br />
In the Near East, the upland areas above the Fertile Crescent<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;(present-day northern Iraq and southern Turkey)<br />
&#xa0;were more conducive to systematic farming than the river valleys.<br />
This region received the necessary rainfall<br />
&#xa0;and was the home of two wild plant species (barley and wheat)<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and four wild animal species (pigs, cows, goats, and sheep) that humans eventually domesticated.<br />
