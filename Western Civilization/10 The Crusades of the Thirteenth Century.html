<h2 id="orgd078e45">10 The Crusades of the Thirteenth Century</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd078e45">
<p class="verse">
After the death of Saladin in 1193, Pope Innocent III initiated the Fourth Crusade.<br />
On its way to the east,<br />
&#xa0;the crusading army became involved in a dispute over the succession to the Byzantine throne.<br />
The Venetian leaders of the Fourth Crusade<br />
&#xa0;saw an opportunity to neutralize their greatest commercial competitor, the Byzantine Empire.<br />
Diverted to Constantinople,<br />
&#xa0;the crusaders sacked that great capital city in 1204<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and declared the new Latin Empire of Constantinople.<br />
Not until 1261 did a Byzantine army recapture Constantinople.<br />
The Byzantine Empire had been saved, but it was no longer a great Mediterranean power.<br />
The restored empire now consisted only of the city of Constantinople<br />
&#xa0;and its surrounding territory along with some lands in Asia Minor.<br />
Though reduced in size, the empire limped along for another 190 years<br />
&#xa0;until its weakened condition finally enabled the Ottoman Turks to conquer it in 1453.<br />
<br />
Despite the failures, the crusading ideal was not yet completely lost.<br />
In Germany in 1212, a youth known as Nicholas of Cologne announced<br />
&#xa0;that God had inspired him to lead a Children’s Crusade to the Holy Land.<br />
Thousands of young people joined Nicholas<br />
&#xa0;and made their way down the Rhine and across the Alps to Italy,<br />
&#xa0;where the pope told them to go home.<br />
Most tried to do so.<br />
At about the same time,<br />
&#xa0;a group of about twenty thousand French children,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;also inspired by the desire to free the Holy Land from the Muslims,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;made their way to Marseilles,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;where two shipowners agreed to transport them to the Holy Land.<br />
Seven ships packed with hymn-singing youths soon left the port.<br />
Two of the ships sank in a storm near Sardinia;<br />
&#xa0;the other five sailed to North Africa, where the children were sold into slavery.<br />
Four more Crusades of adult warriors over the next half-century were no more successful.<br />
Finally, Europe’s Christians grudgingly accepted<br />
&#xa0;that they were not to be the guardians of the the Holy Land.<br />
