<h2 id="org80ff720">19 The French Revolution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org80ff720">
<p class="verse">
On the morning of July 14, 1789,<br />
&#xa0;a Parisian mob of some eight thousand people in search of weapons streamed toward the Bastille,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;a royal armory filled with arms and ammunition.<br />
The Bastille was also a state prison,<br />
&#xa0;and although it now contained only seven prisoners,<br />
&#xa0;in the eyes of these angry Parisians<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;it was a glaring symbol of the government's despotic policies.<br />
The armory was defended by the marquis de Launay and a small garrison of 114 men.<br />
The attack began in earnest in the early afternoon,<br />
&#xa0;and after three hours of fighting, de Launay and the garrison surrendered.<br />
Angered by the loss of ninety-eight of their members,<br />
&#xa0;the victorious mob beat de Launay to death, cut off his head,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and carried it aloft in triumph through the streets of Paris.<br />
When King Louis XVI was informed of the fall of the Bastille by the duke,<br />
&#xa0;he exclaimed, 'Why, this is a revolt.'<br />
'No, Sire,' replied the duke, 'it is a revolution.'<br />
<br />
Historians have long held<br />
&#xa0;that the modern history of Europe began with two significant transformations<br />
&#xa0;&#x2014;the French Revolution and the Industrial Revolution.<br />
Accordingly, the French Revolution has been portrayed as<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;the major turning point	in European political and social history<br />
&#xa0;when the institutions of the 'old regime' were destroyed<br />
&#xa0;and a new order was created based on individual rights, representative institutions,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and a concept of loyalty to the nation rather than the monarch.<br />
This perspective has certain limitations, however.<br />
<br />
France was only one of a number of places in the Western world<br />
&#xa0;where the assumptions of the old order were challenged.<br />
Although some historians have used the phrase 'democratic revolution'<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;to refer to the upheavals of the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,<br />
&#xa0;it is probably more appropriate to speak not of a democratic movement but of a liberal movement<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;to extend political rights and power to the bourgeoisie 'possessing capital,'<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;people not of the aristocracy<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;who were literate<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;and had become wealthy through capitalist enterprises in trade, industry, and finance.<br />
The years preceding and accompanying the French Revolution<br />
&#xa0;included attempts at reform and revolt in the North American colonies,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;Britain, the Dutch Republic, some Swiss cities, and the Austrian Netherlands.<br />
The success of the American and French Revolutions<br />
&#xa0;makes them the center of attention for this chapter.<br />
Not all of the decadent privileges that characterized the old European regime<br />
&#xa0;were destroyed in 1789, however.<br />
The revolutionary upheaval of the era, especially in France,<br />
&#xa0;did create new liberal and national political ideals,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;summarized in the French revolutionary slogan, 'Liberty, Equality, Fraternity,'<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;that transformed France<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;and were then spread to other European countries through the conquests of Napoleon.<br />
