<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb13b0fa">
<p class="verse">
By the end of the sixteenth century,<br />
&#xa0;Europe was beginning to experience some decline in religious passions<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and a growing secularization that affected both the political and intellectual worlds.<br />
Some historians like to speak of the seventeenth century as<br />
&#xa0;a turning point in the evolution of the modern state system in Europe.<br />
The ideal of a united Christian Europe<br />
&#xa0;gave way to the practical realities of a system of secular entities<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;in which matters of state took precedence over the salvation of subjects' souls.<br />
By the seventeenth century,<br />
&#xa0;the credibility of Christianity had been so weakened through religious wars<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that more and more Europeans came to think of politics in strictly secular terms.<br />
<br />
One of the responses to the religious wars and other crises of the time was a yearning for order.<br />
As the internal social and political rebellions and revolts died down,<br />
&#xa0;it became apparent<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that the privileged classes of society&#x2014;the aristocrats&#x2014;remained in control,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;although important differences in political forms existed in the various states.<br />
In many places, the extension of monarchical power was viewed as a stabilizing force.<br />
This development, which historians have called absolutism or absolute monarchy,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;was most evident in France during the flamboyant reign of Louis XIV,<br />
&#xa0;widely regarded as the perfect embodiment of an absolute monarch.<br />
In his memoirs, the duc de Saint-Simon, who had firsthand experience of French court life,<br />
&#xa0;said that Louis was the very figure of a hero,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;so imbued with a natural but most imposing majesty<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;that it appeared even in his most insignificant gestures and movements.<br />
The king's natural grace gave him a special charm as well:<br />
&#xa0;He was as dignified and majestic in his dressing gown as when dressed in robes of state,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;or on horseback at the head of his troops.<br />
His life was orderly:<br />
&#xa0;Nothing could be regulated with greater exactitude than were his days and hours.<br />
His self-control was impeccable:<br />
&#xa0;He did not lose control of himself ten times in his whole life,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and then only with inferior persons.<br />
But even absolute monarchs had imperfections, and Saint-Simon had the courage to point them out:<br />
&#xa0;Louis XIV's vanity was without limit or restraint,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;which led to his distaste for all merit, intelligence, education, and, most of all,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;for all independence of character and sentiment in others,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;as well as his mistakes of judgment in matters of importance.<br />
<br />
But absolutism was not the only response to the search for order in the seventeenth century.<br />
Other states, such as England,<br />
&#xa0;reacted differently to domestic crisis, and another very different system emerged<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;where monarchs were limited by the power of their representative assemblies.<br />
Absolute and limited monarchy were the two poles of seventeenth-century state building.<br />
