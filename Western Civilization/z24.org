Police stop Emmeline Pankhurst and her two daughters from
entering Buckingham Palace to present a petition to the king.
MANY EUROPEANS after 1894 continued to believe they lived
in an era of material and human progress. For some, however, progress entailed much struggle. Emmeline Pankhurst, who became the
leader of the women’s suffrage movement in Britain, said that her
determination to fight for women’s rights stemmed from a childhood memory: ‘‘My father bent over me, shielding the candle flame
with his big hand, and I heard him say, somewhat sadly, ‘What a
pity she wasn’t born a lad.’’’ Eventually, Emmeline Pankhurst and
her daughters marched and fought for women’s right to vote. The
struggle was often violent: ‘‘They came in bruised, hatless, faces
scratched, eyes swollen, noses bleeding,’’ one of the Pankhurst
daughters recalled. Arrested and jailed in 1908, Pankhurst informed
her judges, ‘‘If you had the power to send us to prison, not for six
months, but for six years, or for our lives, the Government must
not think they could stop this agitation. It would go on!’’ It did go
on, and women in Britain did eventually receive the right to vote; to
some, this was yet another confirmation of Europe’s progress.
But the period after 1894 was not just a time of progress; it was
also a time of great tension as imperialist adventures, international
rivalries, and cultural uncertainties disturbed the apparent calm.
After 1880, Europeans engaged in a great race for colonies around
the world. This competition for lands abroad greatly intensified
existing antagonisms among European states.
Ultimately, Europeans proved incapable of finding constructive
ways to cope with their international rivalries. The development
of two large alliance systems---the Triple Alliance and the Triple
Entente---may have helped preserve peace for a time, but eventually
the alliances made it easier for the European nations to be drawn
into the catastrophic carnage of World War I.
The cultural life of Europe in the decades before 1914 reflects
similar dynamic tensions. The advent of mass education produced
better-informed citizens but also made it easier for governments to
stir up the masses by nationalistic appeals through the new mass
journalism. At the same time, despite the appearance of progress,
European philosophers, writers, and artists were advancing cultural
expressions that questioned traditional ideas and values and undermined public confidence. Leading up to 1914, many intellectuals
had a sense of unease about the direction in which society was
heading and a feeling of imminent catastrophe. They proved
remarkably prophetic.

Toward the Modern
Consciousness: Intellectual
and Cultural Developments
Q Focus Question: What developments in science,
intellectual affairs, and the arts in the late nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries ‘‘opened the way to a
modern consciousness,’’ and how did this consciousness
differ from earlier worldviews?
Before 1914, most Westerners continued to believe in the
values and ideals that had been generated by the Scientific
Revolution and the Enlightenment. The ability of human
beings to improve themselves and achieve a better society
seemed well demonstrated by the rising standard of living,
urban improvements, and mass education. Such products
of modern technology as electric lights, phonographs, and
automobiles reinforced the popular prestige of science and
the belief in the ability of the human mind to comprehend
the universe. Near the end of the nineteenth century,
however, a dramatic transformation in the realm of ideas
and culture challenged many of these assumptions. A new
view of the physical universe, alternative views of human
nature, and radically innovative forms of literary and artistic expression shattered old beliefs and opened the way
to a modern consciousness. Although the real impact of
many of these ideas was not felt until after World War I,
they provoked a sense of confusion and anxiety before 1914
that would become even more pronounced after the war.
Developments in the Sciences: A New Physics
Science was one of the chief pillars supporting the optimistic and rationalistic view of the world that many
Westerners shared in the nineteenth century. Supposedly
based on hard facts and cold reason, science offered a
certainty of belief in the orderliness of nature that was
comforting to many people for whom traditional religious beliefs no longer had much meaning. Many naively
believed that the application of already known scientific
laws would give humanity a complete understanding of
the physical world and an accurate picture of reality. The
new physics dramatically altered that perspective.
Throughout much of the nineteenth century, Westerners adhered to the mechanical conception of the universe postulated by the classical physics of Isaac Newton.
In this perspective, the universe was viewed as a giant
machine in which time, space, and matter were objective
realities that existed independent of the individuals observing them. Matter was thought to be composed of
indivisible, solid material bodies called atoms.
These views were first seriously questioned at the end
of the nineteenth century. The French scientist Marie
Curie (1867--1934) and her husband Pierre (1859--1906)
discovered that an element called radium gave off rays of
radiation that apparently came from within the atom
itself. Atoms were not simply hard, material bodies but
small worlds containing such subatomic particles as electrons and protons that behaved in a seemingly random
and inexplicable fashion.
Building on this work, in 1900 a Berlin physicist,
Max Planck (1858--1947), rejected the belief that a heated
body radiates energy in a steady stream but maintained
instead that energy is radiated discontinuously, in irregular packets of energy that he called quanta. The quantum theory raised fundamental questions about the
subatomic realm of the atom. By 1900, the old view of
atoms as the basic building blocks of the material world
was being seriously questioned.
The Work of Einstein Albert Einstein (1879--1955), a
German-born patent officer working in Switzerland,
pushed these theories into new terrain. In 1905, Einstein
published a paper titled ‘‘The Electro-Dynamics of Moving Bodies’’ that presented his special theory of relativity.
According to relativity theory, space and time are not
absolute but relative to the observer, and both are interwoven into what Einstein called a four-dimensional
space-time continuum. Neither space nor time had an
existence independent of human experience. As Einstein
later explained simply to a journalist, ‘‘It was formerly
believed that if all material things disappeared out of the
universe, time and space would be left. According to the

relativity theory, however, time and space disappear together with the things.’’1 Moreover, Einstein concluded
that matter was nothing but another form of energy. His
epochal formula E ¼ mc2---each particle of matter is
equivalent to its mass times the square of the velocity of
light---was the key to explaining the vast energies contained within the atom. It led to the atomic age.
Toward a New Understanding
of the Irrational: Nietzsche
Intellectually, the decades before 1914 witnessed a combination of contradictory developments. Thanks to the
influence of science, confidence in human reason and
progress still remained a dominant thread. At the same
time, however, a small group of intellectuals attacked the
idea of optimistic progress, dethroned reason, and glorified the irrational.
Friedrich Nietzsche (1844--1900) was one of the
intellectuals who glorified the irrational. According to
Nietzsche, Western bourgeois society was decadent and
incapable of any real cultural creativity, primarily because
of its excessive emphasis on the rational faculty at the
expense of emotions, passions, and instincts. Reason,
claimed Nietzsche, actually played little role in human life
because humans were at the mercy of irrational life forces.
How, then, could Western society be renewed? First,
said Nietzsche, one must recognize that ‘‘God is dead.’’
Europeans had killed God, he said, and it was no longer
possible to believe in some kind of cosmic order.
Eliminating God and hence Christian morality had
liberated human beings and made it possible to create a
higher kind of being Nietzsche called the superman:
‘‘I teach you the Superman. Man is something that is to
be surpassed.’’2 Superior intellectuals must free themselves from the ordinary thinking of the masses, create
their own values, and lead the masses. Nietzsche rejected
and condemned political democracy, social reform, and
universal suffrage.
Sigmund Freud and Psychoanalysis
At the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the
twentieth centuries, the Viennese doctor Sigmund Freud
(1856--1939) put forth a series of theories that undermined optimism about the rational nature of the human
mind. Freud’s thought, like the new physics, added to
the uncertainties of the age. His major ideas were published in 1900 in The Interpretation of Dreams, which
contained the basic foundation of what came to be
known as psychoanalysis.
According to Freud, human behavior was strongly
determined by the unconscious, by earlier experiences
and inner forces of which people were largely unaware.
Why did some experiences whose influence persisted
in controlling an individual’s life remain unconscious?
According to Freud, the answer was repression (see the
box on p. 510), a process by which unsettling experiences
were blotted from conscious awareness but still continued
to influence behavior because they had become part of
the unconscious. To explain how repression worked,
Freud elaborated an intricate theory of the inner life of
human beings.
According to Freud, a human being’s inner life was a
battleground of three contending forces: the id, the ego,
and the superego. The id was the center of unconscious
drives and was ruled by what Freud termed the pleasure
principle. As creatures of desire, human beings directed
their energy toward pleasure and away from pain. The id
contained all kinds of lustful drives and desires and
crude appetites and impulses. The ego was the seat of
reason and hence the coordinator of the inner life. It was
governed by the reality principle. Although humans were
dominated by the pleasure principle, a true pursuit of
pleasure was not feasible. The reality principle meant that
people rejected pleasure so that they might live together
in society. The superego was the locus of conscience and
represented the inhibitions and moral values that society
in general and parents in particular imposed on people.
The superego served to force the ego to curb the unsatisfactory drives of the id.
The human being was thus a battleground among id,
ego, and superego. Ego and superego exerted restraining
influences on the unconscious id and repressed or kept
out of consciousness what they wanted to. Repression
began in childhood, and psychoanalysis was accomplished through a dialogue between psychotherapist and
patient in which the therapist probed deeply into memory in order to retrace the chain of repression all the way
back to its childhood origins. By making the conscious
mind aware of the unconscious and its repressed contents, the patient’s psychic conflict was resolved.
The Impact of Darwin:
Social Darwinism and Racism
In the second half of the nineteenth century, scientific
theories were sometimes wrongly applied to achieve
other ends. The application of Darwin’s principle of
organic evolution to the social order came to be known
as social Darwinism. Using Darwin’s terminology,
social Darwinists argued that societies were organisms
that evolved through time from a struggle with their
environment. Progress came from the ‘‘struggle for
survival,’’ as the ‘‘fit’’---the strong---advanced while the
weak declined.
Darwin’s ideas were also applied to human society
in an even more radical way by rabid nationalists and
racists. In their pursuit of national greatness, extreme
nationalists argued that nations, too, were engaged in a
‘‘struggle for existence’’ in which only the fittest survived. The German general Friedrich von Bernhardi
argued in 1907 that ‘‘war is a biological necessity of the
first importance, a regulative element in the life of
mankind which cannot be dispensed with, since without it an unhealthy development will follow, which
excludes every advancement of the race, and therefore
all real civilization. ‘War is the father of all things.’’’3
Numerous nationalist organizations preached the same
doctrine as Bernhardi.
Racism, too, was dramatically revived and strengthened by new biological arguments. Perhaps nowhere was
the combination of extreme nationalism and racism
more evident and more dangerous than in Germany. One
of the chief propagandists for German racism at the turn
of the twentieth century was Houston Stewart Chamberlain (1855--1927), a Briton who became a German
citizen. His book, The Foundations of the Nineteenth
Century, published in 1899, made a special impact on
Germany. Modern-day Germans, according to Chamberlain, were the only pure successors of the Aryans, who
were portrayed as the true and original creators of
Western culture. The Aryan race, under German leadership, must be prepared to fight for Western civilization
and save it from the destructive assaults of such ‘‘lower’’
races as Jews, Negroes, and Orientals. Increasingly, Jews
were singled out as the racial enemy who wanted to
destroy the Aryan race (see ‘‘Jews in the European NationState’’ later in this chapter).
The Culture of Modernity
The revolution in physics and psychology was paralleled
by a revolution in literature and the arts. Before 1914,
writers and artists were rebelling against the traditional
literary and artistic styles that had dominated European
cultural life since the Renaissance. The changes that they
produced have since been called Modernism.
Naturalism and Symbolism in Literature Throughout
much of the late nineteenth century, literature was
dominated by Naturalism. Naturalists accepted the material world as real and felt that literature should be
realistic. By addressing social problems, writers could
contribute to an objective understanding of the world.
Although Naturalism was a continuation of Realism, it
lacked the underlying note of liberal optimism about
people and society that had been prevalent in the 1850s.
The Naturalists often portrayed characters caught in the
grip of forces beyond their control.
The novels of the French writer E´mile Zola (1840--
1902) provide a good example of Naturalism. Against a
backdrop of the urban slums and coalfields of northern
France, Zola showed how alcoholism and different environments affected people’s lives. He had read Darwin’s
Origin of Species and had been impressed by its emphasis
on the struggle for survival and the importance of environment and heredity. These themes were central to his
Rougon-Macquart, a twenty-volume series of novels on
the ‘‘natural and social history of a family.’’ Zola maintained that the artist must analyze and dissect life as a
biologist would a living organism. He said, ‘‘I have simply
done on living bodies the work of analysis which surgeons
perform on corpses.’’
At the turn of the century, a new group of writers,
known as the Symbolists, reacted against Realism.
Primarily interested in writing poetry, the Symbolists
believed that objective knowledge of the world was
impossible. The external world was not real but only a
collection of symbols that reflected the true reality of
the individual human mind. Art, they believed, should
function for its own sake instead of serving, criticizing,
or seeking to understand society. In the works of two of
the symbolist poets, William Butler Yeats and Rainer
Maria Rilke, poetry ceased to be part of popular culture
because only through a knowledge of the poet’s personal language could one hope to understand what the
poet was saying.
Modernism in the Arts Since the Renaissance, artists
had largely tried to represent reality as accurately as
possible. By the late nineteenth century, however, artists
were seeking new forms of expression. The preamble to
modern painting can be found in Impressionism, a
movement that originated in France in the 1870s when a
group of artists rejected the studios and museums and went
out into the countryside to paint nature directly. Camille
Pissarro (1830--1903), one of Impressionism’s founders,
expressed what they sought:
Precise drawing is dry and hampers the impression of the
whole, it destroys all sensations. Do not define too closely
the outlines of things; it is the brush stroke of the right value
and color which should produce the drawing. . . . Work at
the same time upon sky, water, branches, ground, keeping
everything going on an equal basis and unceasingly rework
until you have got it. . . . Don’t proceed according to rules
and principles, but paint what you observe and feel. Paint
generously and unhesitatingly, for it is best not to lose the
first impression.4
Impressionists like Pissarro sought to put into painting
their impressions of the changing effects of light on objects in nature.
An important Impressionist painter was Berthe
Morisot (1841--1895), whose dedication to the new style
of painting won her the disfavor of the traditional French
academic artists. Morisot believed that women had a
special vision that was, she said, ‘‘more delicate than that
of men.’’ Her special touch is evident in Young Girl by the
Window, in which she makes use of lighter colors and
flowing brushstrokes. Near the end of her life, she
lamented the refusal of men to take her work seriously:
‘‘I don’t think there has ever been a man who treated
a woman as an equal, and that’s all I would have asked,
for I know I’m worth as much as they.’’5
By the 1880s, a new movement known as Postimpressionism arose in France and soon spread to other
European countries. Postimpressionism retained the Impressionist emphasis on light and color but carried it even
further by paying more attention to structure and form.
Postimpressionists sought to use both color and line to
express inner feelings and produce a personal statement
of reality rather than an imitation of objects. Impressionist paintings had retained a sense of realism, but the
Postimpressionists shifted from objective reality to subjective reality and in so doing began to withdraw from the
artist’s traditional task of depicting the external world.
The works of the Postimpressionists were the real forerunners of modern art.
A famous Postimpressionist was the tortured and
tragic figure Vincent van Gogh (1853--1890). For van
Gogh, art was a spiritual experience. He was especially
interested in color and believed that it could act as its
own form of language. Van Gogh maintained that artists
should paint what they feel.
By the beginning of the twentieth century, the belief that the task of art was to ‘‘represent reality’’ had
lost much of its meaning. By that time, the new psychology and the new physics had made it evident that
many people were not sure what constituted reality
anyway. Then, too, the development of photography
gave artists another reason to reject visual realism. Invented in the 1830s, photography became popular and
widespread after George Eastman created the first
Kodak camera for the mass market in 1888. What was
the point of an artist doing what the camera did better?
Unlike the camera, which could only mirror reality,
artists could create reality. In modern art, as in literature, individual consciousness became the source of
meaning.
As the twentieth century began, one of the most
important figures in modern art was just beginning his
career. Pablo Picasso (1881--1973) was from Spain but
settled in Paris in 1904. Picasso was extremely versatile and
painted in a remarkable variety of styles. He was instrumental in the development of a new style called Cubism
that used geometric designs as visual stimuli to re-create
reality in the viewer’s mind.
The modern artist’s flight from ‘‘visual reality’’
reached a high point in 1910 with the beginning of
abstract painting. Vasily Kandinsky (1866--1944), a Russian
who worked in Germany, was one of its originators. As is
evident in his Painting with White Border, Kandinsky
sought to avoid representation altogether. He believed
that art should speak directly to the soul. To do so, it
must avoid any reference to visual reality and concentrate
on color.
At the start of the twentieth century, developments in
music paralleled those in painting. Expressionism in
music was a Russian creation, the product of the composer Igor Stravinsky (1882--1971) and the Ballet Russe,
the dancing company of Sergei Diaghilev (1872--
1929). Together they revolutionized the world of
music with Stravinsky’s ballet The Rite of Spring. At
the premiere on May 29, 1913, the pulsating rhythms,
sharp dissonances, and unusual dancing overwhelmed the
Paris audience and caused a riot at the theater.
Politics: New Directions
and New Uncertainties
Q Focus Questions: What gains did women make in
their movement for women’s rights? How did a new
right-wing politics affect the Jews in different parts of
Europe? What political problems did Great Britain,
France, Austria-Hungary, Germany, and Russia
face between 1894 and 1914, and how were they
resolved?
The uncertainties in European intellectual and cultural
life were paralleled by growing anxieties in European
political life. The seemingly steady progress in the growth
of liberal principles and political democracy after 1871
soon slowed or even ceased altogether after 1894. The
new mass politics had opened the door to changes that
many nineteenth-century liberals found unacceptable,
and liberals themselves were forced to move in new directions. The appearance of a new right-wing politics
based on racism added an ugly note to the existing
anxieties. With their newfound voting rights, workers
elected socialists who demanded new reforms when they
took their places in legislative bodies. Women, too, made
demands, insisting on the right to vote and using new
tactics to gain it. In central and eastern Europe, tensions
grew as authoritarian governments refused to meet
the demands of reformers. And outside Europe, a new
giant appeared in the Western world as the United States
emerged as a great industrial power with immense
potential.
The Movement for Women’s Rights
In the 1830s, a number of women in the United States
and Europe, who worked together in several reform
movements, argued for the right of women to divorce and
own property. These early efforts, however, were not
particularly successful. For example, women did not gain
the right to their own property until 1870 in Britain, 1900
in Germany, and 1907 in France.
New Professions Custody and property rights were
only a beginning for the women’s movement, however.
Some middle- and upper-middle-class women gained
access to higher education while others sought entry into
occupations dominated by men. The first field to open
was teaching. Since medical training was largely closed to
women, they sought alternatives in the development of
nursing. One nursing pioneer was Amalie Sieveking
(1794--1859), who founded the Female Association for
the Care of the Poor and Sick in Hamburg, Germany.
As she explained, ‘‘To me, at least as important were the
benefits which [work with the poor] seemed to promise
for those of my sisters who would join me in such a work
of charity. The higher interests of my sex were close to my
heart.’’6 Sieveking’s work was followed by the more famous British nurse Florence Nightingale (1820--1910),
whose efforts during the Crimean War, like those of Clara
Barton (1821--1912) in the American Civil War, transformed nursing into a profession of trained, middle-class
‘‘women in white.’’
The Right to Vote By the 1840s and 1850s, the movement for women’s rights had entered the political arena
with the call for equal political rights. Many feminists
believed that the right to vote was the key to all other
reforms to improve the position of women.
Suffragists had one basic aim: women’s full citizenship in the nation-state. The British women’s movement
was the most vocal and most active in Europe. Emmeline
Pankhurst (1858--1928) and her daughters, Christabel
and Sylvia, founded the Women’s Social and Political
Union, which enrolled mostly middle- and upper-class
women, in 1903. Pankhurst’s organization realized the
value of the media and used unusual publicity stunts to
call attention to its demands (see the box on p. 515).
Derisively labeled ‘‘suffragettes’’ by male politicians, they
pelted government officials with eggs, chained themselves
to lampposts, smashed the windows of department stores
on fashionable shopping streets, burned railroad cars, and
went on hunger strikes in jail.
Although demands for women’s rights were heard
throughout Europe and the United States before World
War I, only in Finland, Norway, and a few American
states did women actually receive the right to vote. It
would take the dramatic upheaval of World War I before
male-dominated governments capitulated on this basic
issue.
Women reformers also took on issues besides suffrage.
In many countries, women supported peace movements.
Bertha von Suttner (1843--1914) became head of the
Austrian Peace Society and protested against the growing
arms race of the 1890s. Her novel Lay Down Your Arms
became a best-seller and brought her the Nobel Peace Prize
in 1905. Lower-class women also took up the cause of
peace. A group of women workers marched in Vienna in
1911 and demanded, ‘‘We want an end to armaments, to
the means of murder, and we want these millions to be
spent on the needs of the people.’’7
The New Woman Bertha von Suttner was but one example of the ‘‘new women’’ who were becoming more
prominent at the turn of the twentieth century. These
women rejected traditional feminine roles. Although some
of them supported political ideologies, such as socialism,
that flew in the face of the ruling classes, others simply
sought new freedom outside the household and new roles
other than those of wives and mothers.
Maria Montessori (1870--1952) was a good example
of the ‘‘new woman.’’ Breaking with tradition, she attended medical school at the University of Rome and in
1896 became the first Italian woman to receive a medical
degree. Three years later, she began a lecture tour in Italy
on the subject of the ‘‘new woman,’’ whom she characterized as a woman who followed a rational, scientific
perspective. In keeping with this ideal, Montessori put her
medical background to work in a school for mentally
retarded children. She devised new teaching materials
that enabled these children to read and write and became
convinced, as she later wrote, ‘‘that similar methods
applied to normal students would develop or set free
their personality in a marvelous and surprising way.’’
Subsequently, she established a system of childhood education based on natural and spontaneous activities in
which students learned at their own pace. By the 1930s,
hundreds of Montessori schools had been established in
Europe and the United States. As a professional woman
and a woman who chose to have a child without being
married, Montessori also embodied some of the freedoms
of the ‘‘new woman.’’
Jews in the European Nation-State
Near the end of the nineteenth century, a revival of
racism combined with extreme nationalism to produce a
new right-wing politics directed against the Jews. AntiSemitism had a long history in Europe, but as a result of
the ideals of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution, Jews had been granted legal equality in many
European countries during the nineteenth century, and
many Jews left the ghetto and became assimilated into
the cultures around them. Jews became successful
bankers, lawyers, scientists, scholars, journalists, and
stage performers. In 1880, for example, Jews made up
10 percent of the population of the city of Vienna but
39 percent of its medical students and 23 percent of its
law students.
These achievements represent only one side of the
picture, however. In Germany and Austria during the
1880s and 1890s, conservatives founded right-wing
anti-Semitic parties that used anti-Semitism to win the
votes of traditional lower-middle-class groups who felt
threatened by the economic forces of the times. However, the worst treatment of Jews at the turn of the
century occurred in eastern Europe, where 72 percent of
the world’s Jewish population lived. Russian Jews were
admitted to secondary schools and universities only
under a quota system and were forced to live in certain
regions of the country. Persecutions and pogroms were
widespread. Hundreds of thousands of Jews decided to
emigrate.
Many went to the United States, although some
(perhaps 25,000 in all) moved to Palestine, the biblical
homeland of the Jews, which soon became the focus of a
Jewish nationalist movement called Zionism.
A key figure in the growth of Zionism was Theodor
Herzl (1860--1904). In 1896, he published a book called
The Jewish State in which he advocated that ‘‘the
Jews who wish it will have their state.’’ Settlement in
Palestine was difficult, however, because it was then
part of the Ottoman Empire, which was opposed to
Jewish immigration.
Despite the problems, however, the
First Zionist Congress, which met in
Switzerland in 1897,
proclaimed as its
aim the creation of
a ‘‘home in Palestine
secured by public
law’’ for the Jewish
people. Although
about a thousand
Jews migrated to Palestine in 1900 and three thousand
more each year after that, the Zionist dream remained a
dream on the eve of World War I.
The Transformation of Liberalism:
Great Britain
In dealing with the problems created by the new mass
politics, liberal governments often followed policies that
undermined the basic tenets of liberalism. This was
certainly true in Great Britain, where the demands of
the working-class movement caused Liberals to move
away from their ideals. Liberals were forced to adopt
significant social reforms due to the pressure of two
new working-class organizations: trade unions and the
Labour Party.
Frustrated by the government failure to enact social
reform, trade unions began to advocate more radical
change of the economic system, calling for ‘‘collective
ownership and control over production, distribution
and exchange.’’ At the same time, a movement for laborers emerged among a group of intellectuals known
as the Fabian Socialists. Neither the Fabian Socialists
nor the British trade unions were Marxist. They did not
advocate class struggle and revolution but rather evolution toward a socialist state by democratic means. In
1900, representatives of the trade unions and Fabian
Socialists coalesced to form the Labour Party. By 1906,
they had managed to elect twenty-nine members to the
House of Commons.
The Liberals, who led the government from 1906 to
1914, perceived that they would have to enact a program
of social welfare or lose the support of the workers. Under
the leadership of David Lloyd George (1863--1945), the
Liberals abandoned the classical principles of laissez-faire
and voted for a series of social reforms. The National
Insurance Act of 1911 provided benefits for workers in
case of sickness and unemployment, to be paid for by
compulsory contributions from workers, employers, and
the state. Additional legislation provided a small pension
for retirees over seventy and compensation for workers
injured in accidents on the job. Though the benefits of
the program and tax increases were both modest, they
were the first hesitant steps toward the future British
welfare state.
In the effort to achieve social reform, Lloyd George
was also forced to confront the power of the House of
Lords. Composed of hereditary aristocrats, the House
of Lords took a strong stance against Lloyd George’s effort
to pay for social reform measures by taxes, however
modest, on the wealthy. The prime minister pushed
through a law in 1911 that restricted the ability of the
House of Lords to impede legislation enacted by the
House of Commons. After 1911, the House of Lords
became largely a debating society.
France: Travails of the Third Republic
In the 1890s, the fragile Third Republic experienced a
crisis that was an outgrowth of the renewed anti-Semitism
in Europe in the late nineteenth century. Alfred Dreyfus, a
Jew, was a captain on the French general staff who was
found guilty by a secret military court early in 1895 of
selling army secrets and condemned to life imprisonment.
Evidence soon emerged that pointed to his innocence.
Another officer, a Catholic aristocrat, was more obviously
the traitor, but the army, a stronghold of aristocratic
and Catholic officers, refused a new trial. Some rightwing journalists even used the case to push their own
anti-Semitic views. Republic leaders, however, insisted on
a new trial after a wave of public outrage. Although the
new trial failed to set aside the guilty verdict, the government pardoned Dreyfus in 1899, and in 1906, he was
fully exonerated.
One result of the Dreyfus affair was a change in
government. Moderate republicans lost control to radical
republicans who were determined to make greater progress toward a more democratic society by breaking the
power of the Republic’s enemies, especially the army and
the Catholic church. The army was purged of all highranking officers who had antirepublican reputations.
Moreover, church and state were officially separated in
1905, and during the next two years, the government
seized church property and began to pay clerical salaries.
These changes ended the political threat from the right to
the Third Republic, which by now commanded the loyalty of most French people.
Growing Tensions in Germany
The new imperial Germany begun by Bismarck continued
as an ‘‘authoritarian, conservative, military-bureaucratic
power state’’ during the reign of Emperor William II
(1888--1918). By 1914, Germany had become the strongest military and industrial power on the Continent.
More than 50 percent of German workers had jobs in
industry, while only 30 percent of the workforce was still
in agriculture. Urban centers had mushroomed in number and size. These rapid changes in William’s Germany
helped produce a society torn between modernization
and traditionalism.
With the expansion of industry and cities came
demands for more political participation and growing
sentiment for reforms that would produce greater
democratization. Conservative forces, especially the
landowning nobility and representatives of heavy industry, two of the powerful ruling groups in Germany,
tried to block it by supporting William II’s activist
foreign policy of finding Germany’s ‘‘place in the sun.’’
Expansionism, they believed, would divert people from
further democratization.
The tensions in German society created by the conflict between modernization and traditionalism were also
manifested in a new, radicalized, right-wing politics. A
number of pressure groups arose to support nationalistic
goals. Such groups as the Pan-German League stressed
strong German nationalism and advocated imperialism as
a tool to overcome social divisions and unite all classes.
They were also anti-Semitic and denounced Jews as the
destroyers of national community.
Austria-Hungary: The Problem
of the Nationalities
At the beginning of the 1890s, Austria-Hungary remained
troubled by the problem of its numerous nationalities
(see Chapter 23). The granting of universal male suffrage
in 1907 served only to exacerbate the problem when
nationalities that had played no role in the government
now agitated in the parliament for autonomy. This led
prime ministers after 1900 to ignore the parliament and
rely increasingly on imperial emergency decrees to govern. Parliament itself became a bizarre forum in which, in
the words of one incredulous observer, ‘‘about a score of
men, all decently clad, were seated or standing, each at his
little desk. Some made an infernal noise violently opening
and shutting the lids of their desks. Others emitted a
blaring sound from little toy trumpets; . . .still others beat
snare drums.’’8
The threat the nationalities posed to the position of
the dominant German minority in Austria also produced
a backlash in the form of virulent German nationalism.
As Austria industrialized in the 1870s and 1880s, two
working-class parties came into existence, both strongly
influenced by nationalism. The Social Democrats, although
a Marxist party, supported the Austrian government,
fearful that the autonomy of the different nationalities
would hinder industrial development and prevent improvements for workers. Even more nationalistic, however,
were the Christian Socialists, who combined agitation for
workers with virulent anti-Semitism.
Industrialization and Revolution
in Imperial Russia
Although industrialization came late to Russia, it progressed rapidly after 1890, especially with the assistance
of foreign investment capital. By 1900, Russia had become the fourth-largest producer of steel, behind the
United States, Germany, and Great Britain. With industrialization came factories, an industrial working
class, and the development of socialist parties, although
repression in Russia soon forced these parties to go
underground and become revolutionary. The Marxist
Social Democratic Party, for example, held its first
congress in Minsk in 1898, but the arrest of its leaders
caused the next one to be held in Brussels in 1903, attended by Russian e´migre´s. The Social Revolutionaries
worked to overthrow the tsarist autocracy and establish
peasant socialism. Having no other outlet for opposition to the regime, they advocated political terrorism,
attempting to assassinate government officials and
members of the ruling dynasty. The growing opposition
to the tsarist regime finally exploded into revolution
in 1905.
The defeat of the Russians by the Japanese in 1904--
1905 encouraged antigovernment groups to rebel against
the tsarist regime. After a general strike in October 1905,
the government capitulated. Nicholas II granted civil
liberties and agreed to create a legislative assembly, the
Duma, elected directly by a broad franchise. But real
constitutional monarchy proved short-lived. Already by
1907, the tsar had curtailed the power of the Duma, and
he fell back on the army and bureaucracy to rule Russia.
The Rise of the United States
Between 1860 and World War I, the United States made
the shift from an agrarian to a mighty industrial nation. American heavy industry stood unchallenged in
1900. In that year, the Carnegie Steel Company alone
produced more steel than Great Britain’s entire steel
industry. Industrialization also led to urbanization.
While established cities, such as New York, Philadelphia, and Boston, grew even larger, other moderate-size
cities, such as Pittsburgh, grew by leaps and bounds
because of industrialization. Whereas 20 percent of
Americans lived in cities in 1860, more than 40 percent
did in 1900.
By 1900, the United States had
become the world’s richest nation
and greatest industrial power. Yet
serious questions remained about
the quality of American life. In 1890,
the richest 9 percent of Americans
owned an incredible 71 percent of
all the wealth. Labor unrest over
unsafe working conditions, strict
work discipline, and periodic cycles
of devastating unemployment led
workers to organize. By the turn of the century, one
national organization, the American Federation of Labor,
emerged as labor’s dominant voice. In 1900, however, it
included only 8.4 percent of the American industrial
labor force.
During the so-called Progressive era after 1900, a
wave of reform swept across the United States. The
Meat Inspection Act and the Pure Food and Drug Act
provided for a limited degree of federal regulation of
corrupt industrial practices. The presidency of Woodrow
Wilson (1913--1921) witnessed the imposition of a graduated federal income tax and the establishment of the
Federal Reserve System, which permitted the federal
government to play a role in important economic decisions formerly made by bankers. Like European states, the
United States was moving slowly into policies that extended the functions of the state.
The Growth of Canada
Canada faced problems of national unity at the end of the
nineteenth century. In 1870, the Dominion of Canada
had four provinces: Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick. With the addition of the
provinces of Manitoba and British
Columbia in 1871, the Dominion of
Canada stretched from the Atlantic
to the Pacific.
Real unity was difficult to
achieve, however, because of the distrust between the English-speaking
majority and the French-speaking
Canadians living primarily in Quebec. Wilfred Laurier,
who became the first French Canadian prime minister in
1896, was able to reconcile the two groups. During his
administration, industrialization boomed, especially in
the production of textiles, furniture, and railway equipment. Hundreds of thousands of immigrants, especially
from Europe, also flowed into Canada. Many settled on
lands in the west, thus helping populate Canada’s vast
territories.
The New Imperialism
Q Focus Question: What drove the new imperialism that
emerged after 1880, and what effects did the European
quest for colonies have on Africa and Asia?
Beginning in the 1880s, European states engaged in an
intense scramble for overseas territory. This new imperialism, as some have called it, led Europeans to carve up
Asia and Africa. What triggered the mad scramble for
colonies?
Impetus for the New Imperialism
The existence of competitive nation-states after 1870 was
undoubtedly a major determinant in the outbreak of the
new imperialism. As European affairs grew tense, competition led European states to acquire colonies abroad to
provide ports and coaling stations for their navies. Great
Britain also often expanded into new regions not for
economic reasons but to keep the French, Germans, or
Russians from setting up bases that could harm British
interests. Colonies were also a source of international
prestige. Once the dash for colonies began, failure to enter
the race was perceived as a sign of weakness, totally unacceptable to an aspiring great power. As a British foreign
minister wrote, ‘‘When I left the Foreign Office in 1880,
nobody thought about Africa. When I returned to it in
1885, the nations of Europe were almost quarreling with
each other as to the various portions of Africa which they
should obtain.’’9 Late-nineteenth-century imperialism was
thus closely tied to nationalism.
It was also tied to social Darwinism and racism.
Social Darwinists believed that in the struggle between
nations, the fit are victorious and survive. Superior races
must dominate inferior races by military force to show
how strong and virile they are. As one Englishman wrote,
‘‘To the development of the White Man, the Black Man
and the Yellow must ever remain inferior, and as the
former raised itself higher and yet higher, so did these
latter seem to shrink out of humanity and appear nearer
and nearer to the brutes.’’10
Some Europeans gave a more religious or humanitarian justification for imperialism by arguing that they
had a ‘‘moral responsibility’’ to civilize ‘‘ignorant’’ peoples. This notion of the ‘‘white man’s burden’’ (see the box
on p. 521) helped at least the more idealistic individuals
rationalize imperialism in their own minds. One British
official declared that the British Empire was, ‘‘under
Providence, the greatest instrument for good that the
world has seen.’’ Thousands of Catholic and Protestant
missionaries went abroad to seek converts to their faith.
Nevertheless, the belief among Europeans that the superiority of their civilization obliged them to impose it on
supposedly primitive nonwhites, even if the primitives
suffered or died in the process, was yet another manifestation of racism.
Some historians have emphasized an economic
motivation for imperialism. There was a great demand for
natural resources and products not found in Western
countries, such as rubber, oil, and tin. Instead of trading
for these products, European investors advocated direct
control of the areas where they originated. The large surpluses of capital that were being accumulated by bankers
and industrialists often encouraged them to seek higher
rates of profit in underdeveloped areas. All of these factors
combined to form an economic imperialism whereby
European finance dominated the economic activity of a
large part of the world.
The Creation of Empires
Whatever the reasons for the new imperialism, it had a
dramatic effect on Africa and Asia as European powers
competed for control of the two continents.
The Scramble for Africa Europeans controlled relatively little of the African continent before 1880. During
the Napoleonic wars, the British had established themselves in southern Africa by taking control of Cape Town,
originally founded by the Dutch. After the wars, the
British encouraged settlers to come to what they called
the Cape Colony. British policies disgusted the Boers or
Afrikaners, as the descendants of the Dutch colonists were
called, and led them in 1835 to migrate north on the
Great Trek to the region between the Orange and Vaal
Rivers (later known as the Orange Free State) and north
of the Vaal (the Transvaal). Hostilities between the British
and the Boers continued.
In the 1880s, British policy in southern Africa
was largely determined by Cecil Rhodes (1853--1902).
Rhodes founded diamond- and gold-mining companies
that enabled him to gain control of a territory north of
the Transvaal that he named Rhodesia after himself.
Rhodes was a great champion of British expansion.
He said once, ‘‘If there be a God, I think what he would
like me to do is to paint as much of Africa British red as
possible.’’ His imperialist ambitions led to his downfall
in 1896, however, when the British government forced
him to resign as prime minister of Rhodesia after he
conspired to overthrow the neighboring Boer government without British approval. Although the British
government had hoped to avoid war with the Boers, it
could not stop extremists on both sides from precipitating such action. The Boer War dragged on from 1899
to 1902, when the Boers were overwhelmed by the
larger British army. British policy toward the defeated
Boers was remarkably conciliatory. Transvaal and the
Orange Free State had representative governments by
1907, and in 1910, the Union of South Africa was
formed. Like Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, it
became a self-governing dominion within the British
Empire.
Before 1880, the only other European settlements in
Africa had been established by the French and the Portuguese. The Portuguese had held on to their settlements
in Angola on the west coast and Mozambique on the
east coast. The French had started the conquest of Algeria
in Muslim North Africa in 1830, although it was not until
1879 that French civilian rule was established there. The
next year, 1880, the European scramble for possession
of Africa began in earnest. By 1900, the French had
added the huge area of French West Africa and Tunis
(Tunisia).
The British took an active interest in Egypt after the
Suez Canal was opened by the French in 1869. Considering the canal their lifeline to India, the British
sought to control the canal area. They landed an expeditionary force in 1882 and soon established a protectorate over Egypt. From there, the British moved
south into the Sudan and seized it after narrowly
averting a war with France. Not to be outdone, Italy
joined in the imperialist scramble. A humiliating defeat
in Ethiopia in 1896 only led the Italians to try again in
1911 by invading and seizing Ottoman Tripoli, which
they renamed Libya.
Central Africa was also added to the list of European
colonies. Popular interest in the forbiddingly dense
tropical jungles of Central Africa was first aroused in the
1860s and 1870s by explorers such as the Scottish missionary David Livingstone and the British American
journalist Henry M. Stanley. But the real driving force for
the colonization of Central Africa was King Leopold II
(1865--1909) of Belgium, who had rushed enthusiastically
into pursuit of empire in Africa: ‘‘To open to civilization,’’
he said, ‘‘the only part of our globe where it has not yet
penetrated, to pierce the darkness which envelops whole
populations, is a crusade, if I may say so, a crusade
worthy of this century of progress.’’ Profit, however, was
far more important to Leopold than progress. In 1876,
Leopold engaged Stanley to establish Belgian settlements
in the Congo.
Between 1884 and 1900, most of the rest of Africa
was carved up by the European powers. Germany also
entered the ranks of the imperialist powers at this time.
Initially, Bismarck had downplayed the significance of
colonies, but as domestic political pressures for a German
empire increased, Bismarck became a political convert to
colonialism. As he expressed it, ‘‘All this colonial business
is a sham, but we need it for the elections.’’ The Germans
established colonies in South West Africa, Cameroons,
Togoland, and East Africa.
By 1914, Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, Spain,
and Portugal had divided Africa (see Map 24.1). Only
Liberia, founded by emancipated American slaves, and
Ethiopia remained free states. Despite the humanitarian
rationalizations about the ‘‘white man’s burden’’ of
‘‘saving’’ and ‘‘enlightening’’ Africans, the continent had
in fact been conquered by the European drive to create
colonial empires. With the exception of the Ethiopians,
who defeated the Italians, any peoples who dared to resist
were swiftly crushed by the superior military force of the
Europeans.
Imperialism in Asia Although Asia had been open to
Western influence since the sixteenth century, not
much of its immense territory had fallen under direct
European control. The Dutch were established in the
East Indies and the Spanish in the Philippines, while the
French and Portuguese had trading posts on the Indian
coast.
It was not until the explorations of Australia by
Captain James Cook between 1768 and 1771 that Britain
took an active interest in the East. The availability of land
for grazing sheep and the discovery of gold led to an
influx of free settlers, who slaughtered many of the indigenous inhabitants. In 1850, the British government
had granted the various Australian colonies virtually
complete self-government, and on January 1, 1901, all the
colonies were unified into the Commonwealth of Australia. Nearby New Zealand, which the British had declared a colony in 1840, was granted dominion status in
1907.
A private trading company known as the British East
India Company had been responsible for subjugating
much of India. In 1858, however, after a revolt of the
sepoys (Indian troops) of the East India Company’s army
had been put down, the British Parliament transferred the
company’s powers directly to the government in London.
In 1876, the title of empress of India was bestowed on
Queen Victoria; hundred of millions of Indians were now
her colonial subjects.
Russian expansion in Asia was a logical outgrowth
of its traditional territorial aggrandizement. Gradually,
Russian settlers moved into cold and forbidding Siberia.
They also moved south, attracted by the crumbling
Ottoman Empire. By 1830, the Russians had established
control over the entire northern coast of the Black Sea
and then pressed on into Central Asia. These advances
brought the Russians to the borders of Persia and Afghanistan, where the British also had interests because of
their desire to protect their holdings in India. In 1907, the
Russians and British agreed to make Afghanistan a buffer
state between Russian Turkestan and British India and
divide Persia into two spheres of influence. Halted by the
British in their expansion to the
south, the Russians moved east in
Asia. The Russians’ occupation of
Manchuria and their attempt to
move into Korea brought war with
Japan. After losing the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, the Russians
agreed to a Japanese protectorate in
Korea; their Asian expansion was
brought to a temporary halt (see
Map 24.2).
The thrust of imperialism after
1880 led Westerners to move into
new areas of Asia hitherto largely
free of Western influence. By the
nineteenth century, the ruling Manchu dynasty of the Chinese empire
was showing signs of decline. In
1842, the British had obtained
(through war) the island of Hong
Kong and rights to trade in a number of Chinese cities. Other Western
nations soon rushed in to gain
similar trading privileges. Britain,
France, Germany, Russia, the United
States, and Japan established spheres
of influence and long-term leases on
Chinese territory.
Japan avoided Western intrusion until 1853--1854, when American naval forces under Commodore
Matthew Perry forced the Japanese
to grant the United States trading
and diplomatic privileges. Japan,
however, managed to avoid China’s
fate. By absorbing and adopting
Western military and industrial
methods, the Japanese developed a
modern commercial and industrial
system as well as a powerful military
state. They established their own
sphere of influence in China, and
five years after they defeated the
Russians in 1905, the Japanese formally annexed Korea.
In Southeast Asia, Britain established control over
Burma (modern Myanmar) and the Malay States while
France played an active role in subjugating Indochina.
In the 1880s, the French extended ‘‘protection’’ over
Cambodia, Annam, Tonkin, and Laos and organized them
into the Union of French Indo-China. Only Siam (Thailand) remained free as a buffer state because of British-French rivalry.

The Pacific was also the scene of great power
struggles and witnessed the entry of the United States
onto the imperialist stage. Soon after Americans had
made Hawaii’s Pearl Harbor into a naval station in
1887, American settlers gained control of the sugar industry on the islands. When Hawaiian natives tried to
reassert their authority, the U.S. Marines were brought
in to ‘‘protect’’ American lives. Hawaii was annexed by
the United States in 1898 during the era of American
nationalistic fervor generated by the Spanish-American
War. The American defeat of Spain encouraged Americans to extend their empire by acquiring Cuba, Puerto
Rico, Guam, and the Philippine Islands. Although the
Filipinos hoped for independence, the Americans refused to grant it. As President McKinley said, the United
States had the duty ‘‘to educate the Filipinos and uplift
and Christianize them,’’ a remarkable statement in view
of the fact that most of them had been Roman Catholics
for centuries. It took three years and sixty thousand
troops to pacify the Philippines and establish American
control.
Responses to Imperialism
When Europeans imposed their culture on peoples they
considered inferior, how did the conquered peoples respond? Initial attempts to expel the foreigners led to
devastating defeats at the hands of Westerners, whose
industrial technology gave them far superior weapons of
war. Most of the indigenous peoples, accustomed to rule
by small elites, simply accepted their new governors,
making the imposition of Western rule relatively easy. The
conquered peoples subsequently adjusted to the rule of
foreigners in different ways. Some sought to maintain
their cultural traditions, but others believed that adoption
of Western ways would enable them to reform their societies and eventually challenge Western rule. Most people
probably stood somewhere between the two extremes.
Four examples illustrate different approaches to adjusting
to foreign rule.
Africa By the beginning of the twentieth century, a
new class of African leaders had emerged. Educated in
colonial schools and some even in the West, they were
the first generation of Africans to know a great deal
about the West and to write in the language of their
colonial masters. Although this ‘‘new class’’ admired
Western culture and even disliked the ways of their own
countries, many came to resent the foreigners and their
arrogant contempt for colonial peoples. Equally vexing
was the fact that the economic prosperity of the West
was never brought to the colonies. To many Africans,
colonialism meant the loss of their farmlands or terrible
jobs on plantations or in sweatshops and factories run
by foreigners.
Although middle-class Africans did not suffer to
the extent that poor peasants or workers on plantations
did, they too had complaints. They usually qualified
only for menial jobs in the government or business.
Segregated clubs, schools, and churches were set up as
more European officials brought their wives and began
to raise families. Europeans also had a habit of addressing natives by their first names or calling an adult
male ‘‘boy.’’
Such conditions led many members of the new urban educated class to harbor mixed feelings toward their
colonial masters and the civilization they represented.
They were willing to admit the superiority of many aspects of Western culture but fervently felt that they
should be allowed to assert their own nationality and
determine their own cultural destiny. Out of this mixture of hopes and resentments emerged the first stirrings
of modern nationalism in Africa. During the first
quarter of the twentieth century, in colonial societies
across Africa, educated native peoples began to organize
political parties and movements seeking the end of
foreign rule.
China The humiliation of China by the Western powers
led to much antiforeign violence, but the Westerners used
this lawlessness as an excuse to extort further concessions
from the Chinese. A major outburst of violence against
foreigners occurred in the Boxer Rebellion in 1900--1901.
‘‘Boxers’’ was the popular name given to Chinese who
belonged to a secret organization called the Society of
Harmonious Fists, whose aim was to push the foreigners
out of China. The Boxers murdered foreign missionaries,
Chinese who had converted to Christianity, railroad
workers, foreign businessmen, and even the German envoy to Beijing. Response to the killings was immediate and
overwhelming. An allied army consisting of British,
French, German, Russian, American, and Japanese troops
attacked Beijing, restored order, and demanded more
concessions from the Chinese government. The imperial
government was so weakened that the forces of the revolutionary leader Sun Yat-sen (1866--1925), who adopted
a program of ‘‘nationalism, democracy, and socialism,’’
overthrew the Manchu dynasty in 1912. The new Republic
of China remained weak and ineffective, and China’s
travails were far from over.
Japan In the late 1850s and early 1860s, it looked as if
Japan would follow China’s fate and be carved up into
spheres of influence by aggressive Western powers. A remarkably rapid transformation, however, produced a very
different result. Before 1868, the shogun, a powerful hereditary military governor assisted by a warrior nobility
known as the samurai, exercised real power in Japan. The
emperor’s functions had become primarily religious. After
the shogun’s concessions to the Western nations, antiforeign sentiment led to a samurai revolt in 1867 and the
restoration of the emperor as the rightful head of the
government. The new emperor was the astute, dynamic,
young Mutsuhito (1867--1912), who called his reign the
Meiji (‘‘enlightened government’’). The new leaders who
controlled the emperor now inaugurated a remarkable
transformation of Japan that has since been known as the
Meiji Restoration.
Recognizing the obvious military and industrial
superiority of the West, the new leaders decided to
modernize Japan by absorbing and adopting Western
methods. Thousands of young Japanese were sent abroad
to receive Western educations, especially in the social and
natural sciences. A German-style army and a British-style
navy were established. The Japanese copied the industrial
and financial methods of the United States and developed a modern commercial and industrial system. A
highly centralized administrative system copied from the
French replaced the old system. Initially, the Japanese
adopted the French principles of social and legal equality,
but by 1890, they had created a political system that was
democratic in form but authoritarian in practice. In
imitating the West, Japan also developed a powerful
military state.
India The British government had been in control of
India since the mid-nineteenth century. Under Parliament’s supervision, a small group of British civil servants
directed the affairs of India’s almost 300 million people.
The British brought order to a society that had been
divided by civil wars for some time and implemented a
relatively honest and efficient government. They also
brought Western technology---railroads, banks, mines,
industry, medical knowledge, and hospitals. The British
introduced Western-style secondary schools and colleges where the Indian upper and middle classes and
professional classes were educated so that they could
serve as trained subordinates in the government and
the army.
But the Indian people paid a high price for the peace
and stability brought by British rule. Due to population
growth in the nineteenth century, extreme poverty was a
way of life for most Indians; almost two-thirds of the
population suffered from malnutrition in 1901. British
industrialization brought little improvement for the
masses. British manufactured goods destroyed local industries, and Indian wealth was used to pay British officials and the large army. The system of education
served only elite, upper-class Indians, and it was conducted only in the rulers’ English language, meaning
that 90 percent of the population remained unschooled.
Even for the Indians who benefited the most from their
Western educations, British rule was degrading. The best
jobs and the best housing were reserved for Britons.
Despite their education, the Indians were never considered equals of the British, whose racial attitudes were
made quite clear by Lord Kitchener, one of Britain’s
foremost military commanders in India, when he said,
‘‘It is this consciousness of the inherent superiority of
the European which has won for us India. However well
educated and clever a native may be, and however brave
he may prove himself, I believe that no rank we can
bestow on him would cause him to be considered an
equal of the British officer.’’11 Such smug racial attitudes
made it difficult for British rule, no matter how beneficent, ever to be ultimately accepted and led to
the rise of an Indian nationalist movement. By 1883,
when the Indian National Congress was formed, moderate, educated Indians were beginning to seek selfgovernment. By 1919, in response to British violence
and British insensitivity, Indians were demanding
complete independence.
Results of the New Imperialism
By 1900, almost all the societies of Africa and Asia were
either under full colonial rule or, as in the case of China
and the Ottoman Empire, at a point of virtual collapse.
Only a handful of states, such as Japan in East Asia,
Thailand in Southeast Asia, Afghanistan and Persia in
the Middle East, and mountainous Ethiopia in East
Africa, managed to escape internal disintegration or
subjection to colonial rule. For the most part, the exceptions were the result of good fortune rather than
design. Thailand escaped subjugation primarily because
officials in Britain and France found it more convenient
to transform the country into a buffer state than to
fight over it. Ethiopia and Afghanistan survived due to
their remote location and mountainous terrain. Only
Japan managed to avoid the common fate through a
concerted strategy of political and economic reform.
With the coming of imperialism, a global economy was
finally established, and the domination of Western
civilization over the cultures of Africa and Asia appeared
to be complete. At the same time, the competition
for lands abroad exacerbated the rivalry among European
states.
International Rivalry and
the Coming of War
Q Focus Questions: What was the Bismarckian system
of alliances, and how successful was it at keeping the
peace? What issues lay behind the international crises
that Europe faced in the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries?
Before 1914, Europeans had experienced almost fifty years
of peace. There had been wars (including wars of conquest in the non-Western world), but none had involved
the great powers. A series of crises occurred that might
easily have led to general war. One reason they did not is
that until 1890, Bismarck of Germany exercised a restraining influence on the Europeans.
Bismarck knew that the emergence of a unified
Germany in 1871 had upset the balance of power established at Vienna in 1815. Fearing a possible antiGerman alliance between France, Russia, and possibly
even Austria, Bismarck made a defensive alliance with
Austria in 1879. In 1882, this German-Austrian alliance
was enlarged with the entrance of Italy. The Triple Alliance of 1882 committed Germany, Austria-Hungary,
and Italy to support the existing political order while
providing a defense against France. At the same time,
Bismarck maintained a separate treaty with Russia,
hoping to prevent a French-Russian alliance that would
threaten Germany with the possibility of a two-front
war. The Bismarckian system of alliances, geared to
preserving peace and the status quo, had worked, but
in 1890, Emperor William II dismissed Bismarck and
began to chart a new direction for Germany’s foreign
policy.
New Directions and New Crises
Emperor William II embarked on an activist foreign
policy dedicated to enhancing German power by finding,
as he put it, Germany’s rightful ‘‘place in the sun.’’ One of
his changes in Bismarck’s foreign policy was to drop the
treaty with Russia, which he viewed as being at odds with
Germany’s alliance with Austria. The ending of the pact
achieved what Bismarck had feared: it brought France and
Russia together. Republican France leapt at the chance to
draw closer to tsarist Russia, and in 1894, the two powers
concluded a military alliance.
During the next ten years, German policies abroad
caused the British to draw closer to France (see the box
above). By 1907, a loose confederation of Great Britain,
France, and Russia---known as the Triple Entente---stood
opposed to the Triple Alliance of Germany, AustriaHungary, and Italy. Europe was divided into two opposing camps that became more and more inflexible and
unwilling to compromise. When the members of the two
alliances became involved in a new series of crises between 1908 and 1913 over control of the remnants of the
Ottoman Empire in the Balkans (see Map 24.3), the stage
was set for World War I.
Crises in the Balkans, 1908--1913
The Bosnian Crisis of 1908--1909 initiated a chain of
events that eventually spun out of control. Since 1878,
Bosnia and Herzegovina had been under the protection of
Austria, but in 1908, Austria took the drastic step of annexing these two Slavic-speaking territories. Serbia became outraged at this action because it dashed the Serbs’
hopes of creating a large Serbian kingdom that would
include most of the southern Slavs. But this possibility was
why the Austrians had annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina.
A large Serbia would be a threat to the unity of their
empire with its large Slavic population. The Russians, as
protectors of their fellow Slavs and with their own desire
to increase their authority in the Balkans, supported the
Serbs and opposed the Austrian action. Backed by the
Russians, the Serbs prepared for war against Austria. At
this point, William II intervened and demanded that the
Russians accept Austria’s annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina or face war with Germany. Weakened from their
defeat in the Russo-Japanese War in 1904--1905, the
Russians backed down. Humiliated, they vowed revenge.
European attention returned to
the Balkans in 1912 when Serbia,
Bulgaria, Montenegro, and Greece
organized the Balkan League and
defeated the Ottomans in the First
Balkan War. When the victorious
allies were unable to agree on how
to divide the conquered Ottoman
territory, the Second Balkan War
erupted in 1913. Greece, Serbia,
Romania, and the Ottoman Empire
attacked and defeated Bulgaria. As a
result, Bulgaria obtained only a
small part of Macedonia, and most
of the rest was divided between
Serbia and Greece. Yet Serbia’s aspirations remained unfulfilled. The
two Balkan wars left the inhabitants
embittered and created more tensions among the great powers.
One of Serbia’s major ambitions had been to acquire Albanian
territory that would give it a port
on the Adriatic. At the London
Conference, arranged by Austria at
the end of the Balkan wars, the
Austrians had blocked Serbia’s
wishes by creating an independent
Albania. The Germans, as Austrian
allies, had supported this move.
In their frustration, Serbian nationalists increasingly portrayed the
Austrians as monsters who were
keeping the Serbs from becoming
a great nation. As Serbia’s chief supporters, the Russians were also upset
by the turn of events in the Balkans.
A feeling had grown among Russian
leaders that they could not back
down again in the event of a confrontation with Austria or Germany
in the Balkans.
Austria-Hungary had achieved another of its aims,
but it was still convinced that Serbia was a mortal threat
to its empire and must at some point be crushed.
Meanwhile, the French and Russian governments renewed their alliance and promised each other that they
would not back down at the next crisis. Britain drew
closer to France. By the beginning of 1914, two armed
camps viewed each other with suspicion. The European
‘‘age of progress’’ was about to come to an inglorious
and bloody end.

CONCLUSION
What many Europeans liked to call their ‘‘age of progress’’ in
the decades before 1914 was also an era of anxiety. Frenzied
imperialist expansion had created vast European empires and
spheres of influence around the globe. This feverish competition
for colonies, however, had markedly increased the existing
antagonisms among the European states. At the same time, the
Western treatment of non-Western peoples as inferior impelled
educated, non-Western elites in these colonies to found movements for national independence. Before these movements could
succeed, however, the power that Europeans had achieved
through their mass armies and technological superiority had to
be weakened. The Europeans inadvertently accomplished this
task for their colonial subjects by demolishing their own
civilization on the battlegrounds of Europe in World War I
and World War II.
The cultural revolutions before 1914 had also produced
anxiety and a crisis of confidence in European civilization. A
brilliant minority of intellectuals had created a modern consciousness that questioned most Europeans’ optimistic faith in reason, the
rational structure of nature, and the certainty of progress. The
devastating experiences of World War I turned this culture of
uncertainty into a way of life after 1918.
