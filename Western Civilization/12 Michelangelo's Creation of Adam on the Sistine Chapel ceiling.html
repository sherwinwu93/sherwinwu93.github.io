<h2 id="orga26bbde">12 Michelangelo's Creation of Adam on the Sistine Chapel ceiling</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga26bbde">
<p class="verse">
Were the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries a continuation of the Middle Ages<br />
&#xa0;or the beginning of a new era?<br />
The answer is that both positions are true.<br />
Although the disintegrative patterns of the fourteenth century continued into the fifteenth,<br />
&#xa0;at the same time there were elements of recovery<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that made the fifteenth century<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;a period of significant political, economic, artistic, and intellectual change.<br />
The humanists or intellectuals of the age<br />
&#xa0;considered their period (from the mid-fourteenth to the mid-sixteenth century) an age of rebirth,<br />
&#xa0;believing that they had restored arts and letters to new glory<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;after they had been neglected or dead for centuries.<br />
The humanists also saw their age as one of accomplished individuals<br />
&#xa0;who dominated the landscape of their time.<br />
Michelangelo, the great Italian artist of the early sixteenth century,<br />
&#xa0;and Pope Julius II, the warrior pope, were two such titans.<br />
The artist's temperament and the pope's temper<br />
&#xa0;led to many lengthy and often loud quarrels between the two.<br />
Among other commissions,<br />
&#xa0;the pope had hired Michelangelo to paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome,<br />
&#xa0;a daunting task for a man long accustomed to being a sculptor.<br />
Michelangelo undertook the project<br />
&#xa0;but refused for a long time to allow anyone, including the pope, to see his work.<br />
Julius grew anxious,<br />
&#xa0;pestering Michelangelo on a regular basis about when the ceiling would be finished.<br />
Exasperated by the pope's requests,<br />
&#xa0;Michelangelo once replied, according to Giorgio Vasari, his contemporary biographer,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that the ceiling would be completed 'when it satisfies me as an artist.'<br />
The pope responded,	'And we want you to satisfy us and finish it soon,'<br />
&#xa0;and then threatened that if Michelangelo did not finish the ceiling quickly<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;the pope would have him thrown down from the scaffolding.<br />
Fearing the pope's anger,<br />
&#xa0;Michelangelo lost no time in doing all that was wanted and quickly completed the ceiling,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;one of the great masterpieces of Western art.<br />
<br />
The humanists' view of their age as<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;a rebirth of the Classical civilization of the Greeks and Romans<br />
&#xa0;ultimately led historians to use the French word Renaissance to identify this age.<br />
Although recent historians have emphasized the many elements of continuity<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;between the Middle Ages and the Renaissance,<br />
&#xa0;the latter age was also distinguished by its own unique characteristics.<br />
