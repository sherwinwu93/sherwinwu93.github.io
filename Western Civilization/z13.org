in front of Charles V at the Diet of Worms

ON APRIL 18, 1521, a lowly monk stood before the emperor
and princes of the Holy Roman Empire in the city of Worms. He
had been called before this august gathering to answer charges of
heresy, charges that could threaten his very life. The monk was confronted with a pile of his books and asked if he wished to defend
them all or reject a part. Courageously, Martin Luther defended
them all and asked to be shown where any part was in error on the
basis of ‘‘Scripture and plain reason.’’ The emperor was outraged by
Luther’s response and made his own position clear the next day:
‘‘Not only I, but you of this noble German nation, would be forever
disgraced if by our negligence not only heresy but the very suspicion
of heresy were to survive. After having heard yesterday the obstinate
defense of Luther, I regret that I have so long delayed in proceeding
against him and his false teaching. I will have no more to do with
him.’’ Luther’s appearance at Worms set the stage for a serious challenge to the authority of the Catholic church. This was by no means
the first crisis in the church’s fifteen-hundred-year history, but its
consequences were more far-reaching than anyone at Worms in
1521 could have imagined.

Throughout the Middle Ages, the medieval Christian church
continued to assert its primacy of position. It had overcome defiance
of its temporal authority by emperors and kings while challenges to
its doctrines had been crushed by the Inquisition and combated by
new religious orders that carried its message of salvation to all the
towns and villages of medieval Europe. The growth of the papacy
had paralleled the growth of the church, but by the end of the
Middle Ages, challenges to papal authority from the rising power of
monarchical states had resulted in a loss of papal temporal authority.
An even greater threat to papal authority and church unity arose in
the sixteenth century when the unity of Christendom was shattered
by the Reformation.

The movement begun by Martin Luther when he made his dramatic stand quickly spread across Europe, a clear indication of dissatisfaction with Catholic practices. Within a short time, new religious
practices, doctrines, and organizations, including Zwinglianism,
Calvinism, Anabaptism, and Anglicanism, were attracting adherents all
over Europe. Seemingly helpless to stop the new Protestant churches,
the Roman Catholic Church underwent a reformation and managed
to revive its fortunes by the mid-sixteenth century. Nevertheless, the
doctrinal divisions between Protestants and Catholics became instrumental in triggering a series of religious wars that dominated the history of western Europe in the second half of the sixteenth century.

Prelude to Reformation

Q Focus Question: What were the chief ideas of the
Christian humanists, and how did they differ from the
ideas of the Protestant reformers?
Martin Luther’s reform movement was not the first in
sixteenth-century Europe. During the second half of the
fifteenth century, the new Classical learning that was part of
Italian Renaissance humanism spread to northern Europe
and spawned a movement called Christian or northern
Renaissance humanism, whose major goal was the reform
of Christendom.

Christian or Northern Renaissance Humanism

The most important characteristic of northern Renaissance
humanism was its reform program. Convinced of the
ability of human beings to reason and improve themselves,
the northern humanists thought that through education in
the sources of Classical and especially Christian antiquity,
they could instill a true inner piety or an inward religious
feeling that would bring about a reform of the church and
society. For this reason, Christian humanists supported
schools, brought out new editions of the classics, and
prepared new editions of the Bible and writings of such
church fathers as Augustine, Ambrose, and Jerome. In the
preface to his edition of the Greek New Testament, the
famous humanist Erasmus wrote:

Indeed, I disagree very much with those who are unwilling
that Holy Scripture, translated into the vulgar tongue, be
read by the uneducated, as if Christ taught such intricate
doctrines that they could scarcely be understood by very few
theologians, or as if the strength of the Christian religion
consisted in men’s ignorance of it. . . . I would that even the
lowliest women read the Gospels and the Pauline Epistles.
And I would that they were translated into all languages so
that they could be read and understood not only by Scots
and Irish but also by Turks and Saracens [Arabs].1
Like later intellectuals, Christian humanists believed that
to change society, they must first change the human beings who compose it.

Erasmus The most influential of all the Christian humanists was the Dutch-born scholar Desiderius Erasmus
(1466--1536). After withdrawing from a monastery, he
wandered to France, England, Italy, Germany, and Switzerland, conversing everywhere in the classical Latin that
might be called his mother tongue. The Handbook of the
Christian Knight, published in 1503, reflected his preoccupation with religion. He called his conception of religion ‘‘the philosophy of Christ,’’ by which he meant that
Christianity should be a guiding philosophy for the direction of daily life rather than the system of dogmatic
beliefs and practices that the medieval church seemed to
stress. In other words, he emphasized inner piety and
deemphasized the external forms of religion (such as the
sacraments, pilgrimages, fasts, veneration of saints, and
relics). To return to the simplicity of the early church,
people needed to understand the original meaning of the
Scriptures and early church fathers.

To Erasmus, the reform of the church meant spreading an understanding of the philosophy of Jesus, providing
enlightened education in the sources of early Christianity,
and making commonsense criticism of the abuses in the
church. This critical approach is especially evident in The
Praise of Folly, written in 1511, in which Erasmus was
able to engage in a humorous yet effective criticism of the
most corrupt practices of his own society. He was especially harsh on the abuses within the ranks of the clergy:

Many of [the monks] work so hard at protocol and at traditional fastidiousness that they think one heaven hardly a suitable reward for their labors; never recalling, however, that
the time will come when Christ will demand a reckoning of
that which he had prescribed, namely charity, and that he
will hold their deeds of little account. One monk will then
exhibit his belly filled with every kind of fish; another will
profess a knowledge of over a hundred hymns. Still another
will reveal a countless number of fasts that he has made, and
will account for his large belly by explaining that his fasts
have always been broken by a single large meal.

Erasmus’ program did not achieve the reform of the church
that he so desired. His moderation and his emphasis
on education were quickly overwhelmed by the passions of
the Reformation. Undoubtedly, though, his work helped
prepare the way for the Reformation; as contemporaries
proclaimed, ‘‘Erasmus laid the egg that Luther hatched.’’ Yet
Erasmus eventually disapproved of Luther and the Protestant reformers. He had no intention of destroying the
unity of the medieval Christian church; instead, his whole
program was based on reform within the church.

Church and Religion on the Eve
of the Reformation

Corruption in the Catholic church was another factor
that spurred people to want reform. No doubt the failure
of the Renaissance popes to provide spiritual leadership
had affected the spiritual life of all Christendom. The
papal court’s preoccupation with finances had an especially strong impact on the clergy. So did the economic
changes of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The
highest positions among the clergy were increasingly held
by either nobles or wealthy members of the bourgeoisie.
Moreover, to increase their revenues, high church officials
(such as bishops, archbishops, and cardinals) took over
more than one church office. This pluralism (the holding
of multiple church offices) begat absenteeism: church
officeholders ignored their duties and hired underlings
who were sometimes not appropriately qualified. Complaints about the ignorance and ineptness of parish
priests became widespread in the fifteenth century.

While the leaders of the church were failing to meet
their responsibilities, ordinary people were clamoring for
meaningful religious expression and certainty of salvation.
As a result, the salvation process became almost mechanical. As more and more people sought salvation through
the veneration of relics, collections of such objects grew.
Frederick the Wise, elector of Saxony and Luther’s prince,
had amassed over five thousand relics to which were attached indulgences (remissions of the penalties for sin)
that could reduce one’s time in purgatory by nearly two
million years. Other people sought salvation in the popular
mystical movement known as the Modern Devotion. The
Modern Devotion downplayed religious dogma and
stressed the need to follow the teachings of Jesus. Thomas
a` Kempis, author of The Imitation of Christ, wrote that
‘‘truly, at the day of judgment we shall not be examined by
what we have read, but what we have done; not how well
we have spoken, but how religiously we have lived.’’

What is striking about the revival of religious piety in
the fifteenth century was its adherence to the orthodox
beliefs and practices of the Catholic church. The agitation
for certainty of salvation and spiritual peace was done
within the framework of the ‘‘holy mother Church.’’ But
as the devout experienced the clergy’s inability to live up
to their expectations, disillusionment grew. The intensification of religious feeling, especially in the second half
of the fifteenth century, resonated little among the
worldly-wise clergy, and this divergence may explain the
tremendous and immediate impact of Luther’s ideas.

Martin Luther and the
Reformation in Germany

Q Focus Question: What were Martin Luther’s main
disagreements with the Roman Catholic Church, and
what political, economic, and social conditions help
explain why the movement he began spread so quickly
across Europe?

The Protestant Reformation began with a typical medieval question: What must I do to be saved? Martin Luther,
a deeply religious man, found an answer that did not fit
the traditional teachings of the late medieval church.
Ultimately, he split with that church, destroying the religious unity of western Christendom.

The Early Luther

Martin Luther was born in Germany on November 10,
1483. His father wanted him to become a lawyer, so Luther enrolled at the University of Erfurt. In 1505, after
becoming a master in the liberal arts, the young man
began to study law. But Luther was not content, not in
small part due to his long-standing religious inclinations.
That summer, while returning to Erfurt after a brief visit
home, he was caught in a ferocious thunderstorm and
vowed that if he survived unscathed, he would become a
monk. He then entered the monastic order of the Augustinian Hermits in Erfurt, much to his father’s disgust.
In the monastery, Luther focused on his major concern,
the assurance of salvation. The traditional beliefs and
practices of the church seemed unable to relieve his obsession with this question. Luther threw himself into his
monastic routine with a vengeance:

I was indeed a good monk and kept my order so strictly that
I could say that if ever a monk could get to heaven through
monastic discipline, I was that monk. . . . And yet my conscience would not give me certainty, but I always doubted
and said, ‘‘You didn’t do that right. You weren’t contrite
enough. You left that out of your confession.’’ The more I
tried to remedy an uncertain, weak and troubled conscience
with human traditions, the more I daily found it more uncertain, weaker and more troubled.3

Despite his herculean efforts, Luther achieved no certainty
of salvation.

To help overcome his difficulties, his superiors recommended that he study theology. Luther received his
doctorate in 1512 and then became a professor in the
theological faculty at the University of Wittenberg, lecturing on the Bible. Sometime between 1513 and 1516,
through his study of the Bible, he arrived at an answer to
his problem.

Catholic doctrine had emphasized that both faith and
good works were required of a Christian to achieve personal salvation. In Luther’s eyes, human beings, weak and
powerless in the sight of an almighty God, could never do
enough good works to merit salvation. Through his study
of the Bible, especially his work on Paul’s Epistle to the
Romans, Luther rediscovered another way of viewing this
problem. To Luther, humans are saved not through their
good works but through faith in the promises of God,
made possible by the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross. The
doctrine of salvation or justification by grace through
faith alone became the primary doctrine of the Protestant
Reformation (justification is the act by which a person is
made deserving of salvation). Because Luther had arrived
at this doctrine from his study of the Bible, the Bible
became for him, as for all other Protestants, the chief
guide to religious truth. Justification by faith and the
Bible as the sole authority in religious affairs were the
twin pillars of the Protestant Reformation.

The Indulgence Controversy

Luther did not see himself as either an innovator or a heretic, but his involvement in the indulgence controversy propelled him into an
open confrontation with church officials and forced him
to see the theological implications of justification by faith
alone. Luther was greatly distressed by the widespread
selling of indulgences, certain that people were guaranteeing their eternal damnation by relying on these pieces
of paper to assure themselves of salvation. Johann Tetzel,
a rambunctious Dominican, hawked the indulgences with
the slogan ‘‘As soon as the coin in the coffer [money box]
rings, the soul from purgatory springs.’’

Greatly angered, Luther issued a stunning indictment
of the abuses in the sale of indulgences, known as the
Ninety-Five Theses (see the box on p. 271). It is doubtful
that Luther intended to break with the church over the
issue of indulgences. If the pope had clarified the use of
indulgences, as Luther wished, Luther would probably
have been satisfied. But Pope Leo X did not take the issue
seriously and is even reported to have said that Luther
was simply ‘‘some drunken German who will amend his
ways when he sobers up.’’ A German translation of the
Ninety-Five Theses was quickly printed in thousands of
copies and received sympathetically in a Germany that
had a long tradition of dissatisfaction with papal policies
and power.

The Quickening Rebellion

In three pamphlets published in 1520, Luther moved toward a more definite
break with the Catholic church. Address to the Nobility of
the German Nation was a political tract written in German
in which Luther called on the German princes to overthrow the papacy in Germany and establish a reformed
German church. The Babylonian Captivity of the Church
attacked the sacramental system as the means by which
the pope and church had held the real meaning of the
Gospel captive for a thousand years. He called for the
reform of monasticism and for the clergy to marry. While
virginity is good, Luther argued, marriage is better, and
freedom of choice is best. On the Freedom of a Christian
Man was a short treatise on the doctrine of salvation. It is
faith alone, not good works, that justifies, frees, and
brings salvation through Jesus. Being saved and freed by
his faith in Jesus, however, does not free the Christian
from doing good works. Rather he performs good works
out of gratitude to God: ‘‘Good works do not make a
good man, but a good man does good works.’’4

Unable to accept Luther’s forcefully worded dissent
from traditional Catholic teachings, the church excommunicated him in January 1521. He was also summoned
to appear before the imperial diet (Reichstag) of the Holy
Roman Empire in Worms, convened by the newly elected
Emperor Charles V (1519--1556). Expected to recant the
heretical doctrines he had espoused, Luther refused and
made the famous reply that became the battle cry of the
Reformation:

Since then Your Majesty and your lordships desire a simple
reply, I will answer without horns and without teeth. Unless
I am convicted by Scripture and plain reason---I do not accept the authority of popes and councils, for they have contradicted each other---my conscience is captive to the Word
of God. I cannot and I will not recant anything, for to go
against conscience is neither right nor safe. Here I stand, I
cannot do otherwise. God help me. Amen.

The young Emperor Charles was outraged at Luther’s
audacity and gave his opinion that ‘‘a single friar who
goes counter to all Christianity for a thousand years must
be wrong.’’ By the Edict of Worms, Martin Luther was
made an outlaw within the empire. His works were to be
burned and Luther himself captured and delivered to the
emperor. Instead, Luther’s prince, the elector of Saxony,
sent him into hiding at the Wartburg castle, where he
remained for nearly a year.

The Rise of Lutheranism

At the beginning of 1522, Luther returned to Wittenberg
in Saxony and began to organize a reformed church.
While at Wartburg, Luther’s foremost achievement was
his translation of the New Testament into German. In the
next dozen years, his German New Testament sold almost
200,000 copies. Lutheranism had wide appeal and spread
rapidly, but not primarily through the written word, as
only 4 to 5 percent of the people in Germany were literate
at the time.

Instead, Luther’s ideas were spread primarily through
the sermon. The preaching of evangelical sermons based
on a return to the original message of the Bible found
favor in churches throughout Germany. Also useful to the
spread of the Reformation were pamphlets illustrated
with vivid woodcuts portraying the pope as a hideous
Antichrist and titled with catchy phrases such as ‘‘I Wonder
Why There Is No Money in the Land’’ (which, of course,
was an attack on papal greed).

Luther was able to gain the support of his prince, the
elector of Saxony, as well as other German rulers among
the more than three hundred states that made up the
Holy Roman Empire. Lutheranism spread to both
princely and ecclesiastical states in northern and central
Germany as well as to two-thirds of the free imperial
cities, especially those of southern Germany, where
prosperous burghers, for both religious and secular reasons, became committed to Luther’s cause. At its outset,
the Reformation in Germany was largely an urban phenomenon. Three-fourths of the early converts to the reform movement were from the clergy, many of them from
the better-educated upper classes, which made it easier
for them to work with the ruling elites in the cities.

A series of crises in the mid-1520s made it apparent,
however, that spreading the word of God was not as easy
as Luther had originally envisioned---the usual plight of
most reformers. Luther experienced dissent within his
own ranks in Wittenberg as well as defection from many
Christian humanists who feared that Luther’s movement
threatened the unity of Christendom. The Peasants’ War
constituted Luther’s greatest challenge, however. In June
1524, peasants in Germany rose in revolt against their
lords and looked to Luther for support. But Luther, who
knew how much his reformation of the church depended
on the full support of the German princes and magistrates, supported the rulers. To Luther, the state and its
rulers were ordained by God and given the authority to
maintain the peace and order necessary for the spread of
the Gospel. It was the duty of princes to suppress all revolt. By May 1525, the German princes had ruthlessly
vanquished the peasant hordes. Luther found himself ever
more dependent on state authorities for the growth and
maintenance of his reformed church.

Organizing the Church

Justification by faith was the starting point for most of
Protestantism’s major doctrines. Since Luther downplayed the role of good works in salvation, the sacraments
also had to be redefined. No longer were they meritearning works; they were now divinely established signs
of the promise of salvation. Luther kept only two of the
Catholic church’s seven sacraments: baptism and the
Lord’s Supper (the Eucharist). Baptism signified rebirth
through grace. Regarding the Lord’s Supper, Luther
denied the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation,
which taught that the substance of the bread and wine
consumed in the rite is miraculously transformed into
the body and blood of Jesus. Yet he continued to insist
on the real presence of Jesus’ body and blood in the
bread and wine given as a testament to God’s forgiveness
of sin.

Luther took an active role in establishing a reformed church. Since the Catholic ecclesiastical hierarchy had been scrapped, Luther came to rely increasingly
on the princes or state authorities to organize and guide
the new Lutheran reformed churches. The Lutheran
churches in Germany (and later in Scandinavia) quickly
became territorial or state churches in which the state
supervised and disciplined church members. As part of
the development of these state-dominated churches,
Luther also instituted new religious services to replace
the Mass. These featured a worship service consisting
of a German liturgy that focused on Bible reading,
preaching the word of God, and song. Following his
own denunciation of clerical celibacy, Luther married a
former nun, Katherina von Bora, in 1525. His union
provided a model of married and family life for the new
Protestant minister.

Germany and the Reformation:
Religion and Politics

From its very beginning, the fate of Luther’s movement
was closely tied to political affairs. In 1519, Charles I,
king of Spain and the grandson of the Emperor Maximilian, was elected Holy Roman Emperor as Charles V
(1519--1556). Charles V ruled over an immense empire,
consisting of Spain and its overseas possessions, the
traditional Austrian Habsburg lands, Bohemia, Hungary,
the Low Countries, and the kingdom of Naples in
southern Italy (see Map 13.1). The extent of his possessions was reflected in the languages he used: ‘‘I speak
Spanish to God, Italian to women, French to men, and
German to my horse.’’ Politically, Charles wanted to
maintain his dynasty’s control over his enormous empire; religiously, he hoped to preserve the unity of the
Catholic faith throughout his empire. Despite his
strengths, Charles spent a lifetime in futile pursuit of his
goals. Four major problems---the French, the papacy, the
Turks, and Germany’s internal situation---cost him both
his dream and his health.

Charles V’s chief political concern was his rivalry
with the Valois king of France, Francis I (1515--1547).
Encircled by the possessions of the Habsburg empire,
Francis became embroiled in conflict with Charles over
disputed territories in southern France, the Netherlands,
the Rhineland, northern Spain, and Italy. These conflicts,
known as the Habsburg-Valois Wars, were fought intermittently for more than two decades (1521--1544).

At the same time, Charles faced opposition from
Pope Clement VII (1523--1534), who, guided by political
considerations, joined the side of Francis I. The advance
of the Ottoman Turks into the eastern part of Charles’s
empire forced the emperor to divert forces there as well.
Under Suleiman the Magnificent (1520--1566), the Ottoman
Turks overran most of Hungary, moved into Austria, and
advanced as far as Vienna, where they were finally repulsed
in 1529.

Finally, the internal political situation in the Holy
Roman Empire was also not in Charles’s favor. Germany
was a land of several hundred territorial states---princely
states, ecclesiastical principalities, and free imperial cities.
Although all owed loyalty to the emperor, Germany’s
medieval development had enabled these states to become
quite independent of imperial authority. They had no
desire to have a strong emperor. By the time Charles V
was able to bring military forces to Germany in 1546,
Lutheranism had become well established and the Lutheran princes were well organized. Unable to impose his
will on Germany, Charles was forced to negotiate a truce.
An end to religious warfare in Germany came in 1555
with the Peace of Augsburg, which marked an important
turning point in the history of the Reformation. The
division of Christianity was formally acknowledged,
with Lutheranism granted equal legal standing with
Catholicism. Moreover, the peace settlement accepted
the right of each German ruler to determine the religion
of his subjects. Charles’s hope for a united empire had
been completely dashed, and the ideal of medieval
Christian unity was irretrievably lost. The rapid proliferation of new Protestant groups served to underscore
the new reality.

The Spread of the Protestant
Reformation

Q Focus Questions: What were the main tenets of
Lutheranism, Zwinglianism, Calvinism, and
Anabaptism, and how did they differ from each other
and from Catholicism? What impact did political,
economic, and social conditions have on the
development of these four reform movements?

For both Catholics and Protestant reformers, Luther’s
heresy also raised the question of how to determine what
constituted the correct interpretation of the Bible. The
inability to agree on this issue led not only to theological
confrontations but also to bloody warfare because each
Christian group was unwilling to admit that it could be
wrong.

The Zwinglian Reformation

In the sixteenth century, the
Swiss Confederation was a loose
association of thirteen selfgoverning states called cantons.
Theoretically part of the Holy
Roman Empire, they had become virtually independent in
1499. The six forest cantons were
democratic republics, while the
seven urban cantons, which included Zu¨rich, Bern, and Basel,
were governed primarily by city
councils controlled by narrow
oligarchies of wealthy citizens.

Ulrich Zwingli (1484--1531)
was ordained a priest in 1506 and
accepted an appointment as a
cathedral priest in the Great Minster of Zu¨rich in 1518.
Zwingli’s preaching of the Gospel caused such unrest that
the city council in 1523 held a public disputation or debate in the town hall. Zwingli’s party was accorded the
victory, and the council declared that ‘‘Mayor, Council
and Great Council of Zu¨rich, in order to do away with
disturbance and discord, have upon due deliberation and
consultation decided and resolved that Master Zwingli
should continue as heretofore to proclaim the Gospel and
the pure sacred Scriptures.’’6 Over the next two years,
evangelical reforms were promulgated in Zu¨rich by a city
council strongly influenced by Zwingli. Relics and images
were abolished; all paintings and decorations were removed from the churches and replaced by whitewashed
walls. The Mass was replaced by a new liturgy consisting
of Scripture reading, prayer, and sermons. Monasticism,
pilgrimages, the veneration of saints, clerical celibacy, and
the pope’s authority were all abolished as remnants of
papal Christianity.

As his movement began to spread to other cities
in Switzerland, Zwingli sought an alliance with Martin
Luther and the German reformers. Protestant political
leaders attempted to promote an alliance of the Swiss and
German reformed churches by persuading the leaders of
both groups to attend a colloquy (conference) at Marburg
to resolve their differences. Although both the German
and Swiss reformers realized the need for unity to defend
against the opposition of Catholic authorities, they were
unable to agree on the interpretation of the Lord’s Supper
(see the box on p. 276). Zwingli believed that the scriptural words ‘‘This is my body’’ and ‘‘This is my blood’’
should be taken symbolically, not literally. To Zwingli, the
Lord’s Supper was only a meal of remembrance, and he
refused to accept Luther’s insistence on the real presence of the
body and blood of Jesus. The
Marburg Colloquy produced no
agreement and no evangelical alliance. It was a foretaste of the
issues that would divide one reform group from another and
eventually lead to the creation of
a variety of Protestant groups.

In October 1531, war erupted
between the Swiss Protestant and
Catholic cantons. Zu¨rich’s army
was routed, and Zwingli was
found wounded on the battlefield.
His enemies killed him, cut up his
body, burned it, and scattered the
ashes. This Swiss civil war of 1531
provided an early indication of
what religious passions would
lead to in the sixteenth century. Unable to find peaceful
ways to agree on the meaning of the Gospel, the disciples
of Christianity resorted to violence and decision by force.
When informed of Zwingli’s death, Martin Luther, who
had not forgotten the confrontation at Marburg, is said to
have remarked that Zwingli ‘‘got what he deserved.’’

The Radical Reformation: The Anabaptists

Although many reformers were ready to allow the state to
play an important, if not dominant, role in church affairs,
some people rejected this kind of magisterial reformation
and favored a far more radical reform movement. Collectively called the Anabaptists, these radicals were actually members of a large variety of groups who had certain
characteristics in common.

To the Anabaptists, the true Christian church was a
voluntary association of believers who had undergone
spiritual rebirth and had then been baptized into the
church. Anabaptists advocated adult rather than infant
baptism. No one, they believed, should be forced to accept
the Bible as truth. They also tried to return literally to the
practices and spirit of early Christianity. Adhering to the
accounts of early Christian communities in the New
Testament, they followed a strict sort of democracy in
which all believers were considered equal. Each church
chose its own minister, who might be any member of the
community because all Christians were considered priests
(though women were often excluded). Those chosen as
ministers had the duty to lead services, which were very
simple and contained nothing not found in the early
church. Like early Christians, Anabaptists, who called
themselves ‘‘Christians’’ or ‘‘Saints,’’ accepted that they
would have to suffer for their faith. Anabaptists rejected
theological speculation in favor of simple Christian living
according to what they believed was the pure word of
God. The Lord’s Supper was interpreted as a remembrance, a meal of fellowship celebrated in the evening in
private houses according to Jesus’ example.

Unlike the Catholics and other Protestants, most
Anabaptists believed in the complete separation of church
and state. Not only was government to be excluded from
the realm of religion, but it was not even supposed to
exercise political jurisdiction over true Christians. Human
law had no power over those whom God had saved.
Anabaptists refused to hold political office or bear arms
because many took the commandment ‘‘Thou shall not
kill’’ literally, although some Anabaptist groups did resort
to violence. Their political beliefs as much as their religious
beliefs caused the Anabaptists to be regarded as dangerous
radicals who threatened the fabric of sixteenth-century
society. Indeed, the chief thing Protestants and Catholics
could agree on was the need to stamp out the Anabaptists.

One early group of Anabaptists known as the Swiss
Brethren arose in Zu¨rich. Their ideas frightened Zwingli,
and they were expelled from the city in 1523. As their
teachings spread through southern Germany, the Austrian
Habsburg lands, and Switzerland, Anabaptists suffered
ruthless persecution, especially after the Peasants’ War of
1524--1525, when the upper classes resorted to repression.
Virtually eliminated in Germany, Anabaptist survivors
emerged in Moravia, Poland, and the Netherlands.

Menno Simons (1496--1561) was the most responsible for rejuvenating Dutch Anabaptism. A popular leader,
Menno dedicated his life to the spread of a peaceful,
evangelical Anabaptism that stressed separation from the
world in order to live a truly Jesus-like life. The Mennonites, as his followers were called, spread from the
Netherlands into northwestern Germany and eventually
into Poland and Lithuania as well as the New World.
Remnant communities of both Mennonites and Amish,
who are also descended from the Anabaptists, can still be
found in the United States and Canada today.

The Reformation in England

The English Reformation was initiated by King Henry
VIII (1509--1547), who wanted to divorce his first wife,
Catherine of Aragon, because she had failed to produce a
male heir. Furthermore, Henry had fallen in love with
Anne Boleyn, a lady-in-waiting to Queen Catherine.
Anne’s discontent with being merely the king’s mistress
and the king’s desire to have a legitimate male heir made
their marriage imperative, but the king’s first marriage
stood in the way.

Normally, church authorities might have been willing
to grant the king an annulment of his marriage, but Pope
Clement VII was dependent on the Holy Roman Emperor,
Charles V, who happened to be Catherine’s nephew. Impatient with the pope’s inaction, Henry sought to obtain
an annulment of his marriage in England’s own ecclesiastical courts. As archbishop of Canterbury and head of
the highest ecclesiastical court in England, Thomas
Cranmer held official hearings on the king’s case and ruled
in May 1533 that the king’s marriage to Catherine was
‘‘null and absolutely void.’’ He then validated Henry’s secret
marriage to Anne, who had become pregnant. At the beginning of June, Anne was crowned queen. Three months
later, a child was born. Much to the king’s disappointment,
the baby was a girl, the future Queen Elizabeth.

In 1534, at Henry’s request, Parliament moved to
finalize the Church of England’s break with Rome. The
Act of Supremacy of 1534 declared that the king was
‘‘taken, accepted, and reputed the only supreme head on
earth of the Church of England,’’ a position that gave him
control of doctrine, clerical appointments, and discipline.

Although Henry VIII had broken with the papacy,
little changed in matters of doctrine, theology, and ceremony. Some of his supporters, such as Archbishop
Cranmer, sought a religious reformation as well as an
administrative one, but Henry was unyielding. When
Henry died in 1547, he was succeeded by his son, the
underage and sickly Edward VI (1547--1553), the son of
Henry’s third wife, Jane Semour. During Edward’s reign,
Cranmer and others inclined toward Protestant doctrines
were able to move the Church of England (also known as
the Anglican church) in a more Protestant direction. New
acts of Parliament instituted the right of the clergy to
marry, the elimination of religious images, and the creation of a revised Protestant liturgy that was elaborated in
a new prayer book known as the Book of Common
Prayer. These rapid changes in doctrine and liturgy
aroused much opposition and prepared the way for the
reaction that occurred when Mary, Henry’s daughter by
Catherine of Aragon, came to the throne.

Mary (1553--1558) was a Catholic who intended to
restore England to Roman Catholicism. But her restoration of Catholicism aroused much opposition. There was
widespread antipathy to Mary’s unfortunate marriage to
Philip II, the son of Charles V and future king of Spain.
Philip was strongly disliked in England, and Mary’s foreign policy of alliance with Spain simply stoked that
hostility. The burning of more than three hundred
Protestant heretics aroused further ire against ‘‘Bloody
Mary.’’ As a result of her policies, Mary managed to
achieve the opposite of what she had intended: England
was more Protestant by the end of her reign than it had
been at the beginning.

John Calvin and the Development of Calvinism

Of the second generation of Protestant reformers, one
stands out as the premier systematic theologian and organizer of the Protestant movement---John Calvin (1509--
1564). Calvin was educated in his native France, but after
his conversion to Protestantism, he was forced to flee to the
safety of Switzerland. In 1536, he published the first edition
of the Institutes of the Christian Religion, a masterful synthesis of Protestant thought that immediately secured Calvin’s reputation as one of the new leaders of Protestantism.

Calvin’s Ideas

On most important doctrines, Calvin
stood very close to Luther. He adhered to the doctrine of
justification by faith alone to explain how humans achieved
salvation. But Calvin also placed much emphasis on the absolute sovereignty of God or the ‘‘power, grace and glory of
God.’’ One of the ideas derived from his emphasis on
the absolute sovereignty of God---predestination---gave a
unique cast to Calvin’s teachings. This ‘‘eternal decree,’’ as Calvin called it,meantthatGod had predestinedsome people
to be saved (the elect) and others to be damned (the reprobate). According to Calvin, ‘‘He has once for all determined,
both whom he would admit to salvation, and whom he
would condemn to destruction.’’7 Although Calvin stressed
that there could be no absolute certainty ofsalvation,some of
his followers did not always make this distinction. The
practical psychological effect of predestination was to give
some later Calvinists an unshakable conviction that they were
doing God’s work on earth. Thus Calvinism became a dynamic and activist faith. It is no accident that Calvinism
became the militant international form of Protestantism.

To Calvin, the church was a divine institution responsible for preaching the word of God and administering the sacraments. Calvin kept the same two sacraments
as other Protestant reformers, baptism and the Lord’s
Supper. Calvin believed in the real presence of Jesus in
the sacrament of the
Lord’s Supper, but
only in a spiritual
sense. Jesus’ body is at
the right hand of God
and thus cannot be in
the sacrament, but to
the believer, Jesus is
spiritually present in
the Lord’s Supper.

In 1536, Calvin
began working to reform the city of Geneva. He established a
church government
that used both clergy
and laymen in the
service of the church. The Consistory, a special body for enforcing moral discipline, was set up as a court to oversee the
moral life and doctrinal purity of Genevans. The Consistory
had the right to punish people who deviated from the
church’s teachings and moral principles.

Calvin’s success in Geneva enabled the city to become
a vibrant center of Protestantism. John Knox, the Calvinist
reformer of Scotland, called Geneva ‘‘the most perfect
school of Christ on earth.’’ Following Calvin’s lead, missionaries trained in Geneva were sent to all parts of Europe.
Calvinism became established in France, the Netherlands,
Scotland, and central and eastern Europe. By the midsixteenth century, Calvinism had replaced Lutheranism as
the militant international form of Protestantism, and
Calvin’s Geneva stood as the fortress of the Reformation.

The Social Impact of the
Protestant Reformation

Q Focus Question: What impact did the Protestant
Reformation have on the society of the sixteenth
century?
Because Christianity was such an integral part of European
life, it was inevitable that the Reformation would have an
impact on the family and popular religious practices.

The Family

For centuries, Catholicism had praised the family and
sanctified its existence by making marriage a sacrament.
But the Catholic church’s high regard for abstinence from
sex as the surest way to holiness made the celibate state of
the clergy preferable to marriage. Nevertheless, because
not all men could remain chaste, marriage offered the best
means to control sexual urges and give them a purpose,
the procreation of children. To some extent, this attitude
persisted among the Protestant reformers; Luther, for example, argued that sex in marriage allowed one to ‘‘make
use of this sex in order to avoid sin,’’ and Calvin advised
that every man should ‘‘abstain from marriage only so
long as he is fit to observe celibacy.’’ If ‘‘his power to tame
lust fails him,’’ then he must marry.

But the Reformation did bring some change to the
conception of the family. Both Catholic and Protestant
clergy preached sermons advocating a more positive side to
family relationships. The Protestants were especially important in developing this new view of the family. Because
Protestantism had eliminated any idea of special holiness
for celibacy, abolishing both monasticism and a celibate
clergy, the family could be placed at the center of human
life, and a new stress on ‘‘mutual love between man and
wife’’ could be extolled. But were doctrine and reality the
same? For more radical religious groups, at times they were.
One Anabaptist wrote to his wife before his execution: ‘‘My
faithful helper, my loyal friend. I praise God that he gave
you to me, you who have sustained me in all my trial.’’8 But
more often reality reflected the traditional roles of husband
as the ruler and wife as the obedient servant whose chief
duty was to please her husband. Luther stated it clearly:

The rule remains with the husband, and the wife is compelled to obey him by God’s command. He rules the home
and the state, wages war, defends his possessions, tills the
soil, builds, plants, etc. The woman on the other hand is like
a nail driven into the wall . . . so the wife should stay at home
and look after the affairs of the household, as one who has
been deprived of the ability of administering those affairs
that are outside and that concern the state. She does not go
beyond her most personal duties.9

Obedience to her husband was not a woman’s only role; her
other important duty was to bear children. To Calvin and
Luther, this function of women was part of the divine plan.
God punishes women for the sins of Eve by the burdens of
procreation and feeding and nurturing their children, but
‘‘it is a gladsome punishment if you consider the hope of
eternal life and the honor of motherhood which had been
left to her.’’10 Although the Protestant reformers sanctified
this role of woman as mother and wife, viewing it as a holy
vocation, Protestantism also left few alternatives for
women. Because monasticism had been destroyed, that
career avenue was no longer available; for most Protestant
women, family life was their only destiny. At the same time,
by emphasizing the father as ‘‘ruler’’ and hence the center
of household religion, Protestantism even removed the
woman from her traditional role as controller of religion in
the home. Overall, the Protestant Reformation did not
noticeably transform women’s subordinate place in society.

Religious Practices and Popular Culture

The attacks of Protestant reformers on the Catholic
church led to radical changes in religious practices. The
Protestant Reformation abolished or severely curtailed
such customary practices as indulgences, the veneration of
relics and saints, pilgrimages, monasticism, and clerical
celibacy. The elimination of saints put an end to the numerous celebrations of religious holy days and changed a
community’s sense of time. Thus in Protestant communities, religious ceremonies and imagery, such as processions and statues, tended to be replaced with individual
private prayer, family worship, and collective prayer and
worship at the same time each week on Sunday.

In addition to abolishing saints’ days and religious
carnivals, some Protestant reformers even tried to eliminate
customary forms of entertainment. Puritans (as English
Calvinists were known), for example, attempted to ban
drinking in taverns, dramatic performances, and dancing. Dutch Calvinists denounced the tradition of giving
small presents to children on the feast of Saint Nicholas
in December. Many of these Protestant attacks on
popular culture were unsuccessful, however. The importance of taverns in English social
life made it impossible to eradicate
them, and celebrations at Christmastime persisted in the Dutch
Netherlands.

The Catholic
Reformation

Q Focus Question: What measures
did the Roman Catholic Church
take to reform itself and to
combat Protestantism in the
sixteenth century?

By the mid-sixteenth century, Lutheranism had become established in Germany and Scandinavia and Calvinism
in parts of Switzerland, France, the
Netherlands, and eastern Europe (see
Map 13.2). In England, the split from
Rome had resulted in the creation of a
national church. The situation in Europe did not look particularly favorable for the Roman Catholic Church.
But even at the beginning of the sixteenth century, constructive, positive
forces were at work for reform within
the Catholic church, and in a few
decades, these efforts were being
directed by a revived and reformed
papacy, giving rise to a Catholic Reformation. Historians focus on three
chief pillars of the Catholic Reformation: the development of the Jesuits,
the creation of a reformed and revived
papacy, and the Council of Trent.

The Society of Jesus

The Society of Jesus, members of which
are known as Jesuits, was founded by a
Spanish nobleman, Ignatius of Loyola
(1491--1556), whose injuries in battle
cut short his military career. Loyola
experienced a spiritual torment similar
to Luther’s, but unlike Luther, he resolved his problems not
by a new doctrine but by a decision to submit to the will of
the church. Unable to be a real soldier, he vowed to be a
soldier of God. Over a period of twelve years, Loyola prepared for his lifework by prayer, pilgrimages, going to school,
and working out a spiritual program in his brief but
powerful book, The Spiritual Exercises. This was a training
manual for spiritual development, emphasizing exercises by
which the human will could be strengthened and made to
follow the will of God as manifested through his instrument,
the Catholic church (see the box above).

Loyola gathered together a small group of individuals
who were recognized as a religious order by a papal bull in
1540. The new order was grounded on the principles of
absolute obedience to the papacy, a strict hierarchical
order for the society, the use of education to achieve its
goals, and a dedication to engage in ‘‘conflict for God.’’
Executive leadership was put in the hands of a general,
who nominated all important positions in the order and
was to be revered as the absolute head of the order. Loyola
served as the first general of the order until his death in
1556. A special vow of absolute obedience to the pope
made the Jesuits an important instrument for papal policy.

The Jesuits were active on behalf of the Catholic faith.
They established well-disciplined schools, believing that
the thorough education of young people was crucial to
combat the advance of Protestantism. Another prominent
Jesuit activity was the propagation of the Catholic faith
among non-Christians. Francis Xavier (1506--1552), one
of the original members of the Society of Jesus, carried the
message of Catholic Christianity to the East. After converting tens of thousands in India, he traveled to Malacca
and the Moluccas before reaching Japan in 1549. He spoke
highly of the Japanese: ‘‘They are a people of excellent
morals---good in general and not malicious.’’11 Thousands
of Japanese, especially in the southernmost islands, became Christians. In 1552, Xavier set out for China but
died of fever before he reached the mainland.

Although conversion efforts inJapan provedshort-lived,
Jesuit activity in China, especially that of the Italian Matteo
Ricci (1552--1610), was more long-lasting. Recognizing the
Chinese pride in their own culture, the Jesuits attempted to
draw parallels between Christian and Confucian concepts
and to show the similarities between Christian morality and
Confucian ethics. For their part, the missionaries were impressed with many aspects of Chinese civilization, and
reports of their experiences heightened European curiosity
about this great society on the other side of the world.

The Jesuits were also determined to carry the Catholic banner and fight Protestantism. Jesuit missionaries
succeeded in restoring Catholicism to parts of Germany
and eastern Europe. Poland was largely won back for the
Catholic church through Jesuit efforts.

A Revived Papacy

A reformed papacy was another important factor in the
development of the CatholicReformation. The pontificate of
Pope Paul III (1534--1549) proved significant. Raised in the
lap of luxury, Paul III continued Renaissance papal practices
by appointing his nephews as cardinals, involving himself in
politics, and patronizing arts and letters on a lavish scale.
Nevertheless, he perceived the need for change and expressed
it decisively. Advocates of reform, such as Gasparo Contarini
and Gian Pietro Caraffa, were made cardinals. In 1535, Paul
took the audaciousstep of appointing a commission tostudy
the church’s condition. The Reform Commission’s report in
1537 blamedthe church’s problems onthe corruptpolicies of
popes and cardinals. It was also Paul III who formally recognized the Jesuits and began the Council of Trent.

A decisive turning point in the direction of the
Catholic Reformation and the nature of papal reform
came in the 1540s. In 1541, a colloquy had been held at
Regensburg in a final attempt to settle the religious division peacefully. Here Catholic moderates, such as Cardinal Contarini, who favored concessions to Protestants
in the hope of restoring Christian unity, reached a compromise with Protestant moderates on a number of
doctrinal issues. When Contarini returned to Rome with
these proposals, Cardinal Caraffa and other hard-liners,
who regarded all compromise with Protestant innovations
as heresy, accused him of selling out to the heretics. It
soon became apparent that the conservative reformers
were in the ascendancy when Caraffa was able to persuade
Paul III to establish the Roman Inquisition or Holy Office
in 1542 to ferret out doctrinal errors. There was to be no
compromise with Protestantism.

When Cardinal Caraffa was chosen pope as Paul IV
(1555--1559), he so increased the power of the Inquisition
that even liberal cardinals were silenced. This ‘‘first true pope
of the Catholic Counter-Reformation,’’ as he has been called,
also created the Index of Forbidden Books, a list of books
that Catholics were not allowed to read. It included all the
works of Protestant theologians. Any hope of restoring
Christian unity by compromise was fading. The activities of
the Council of Trent, the third major pillar of the Catholic
Reformation, made compromise virtually impossible.

The Council of Trent

In March 1545, a group of cardinals, archbishops, bishops,
abbots, and theologians met in the city of Trent on the
border between Germany and Italy and initiated the
Council of Trent, which met in three major sessions between 1545 and 1563. Moderate Catholic reformers hoped
that compromises would be made in formulating doctrinal
definitions that would encourage Protestants to return to
the church. Conservatives, however, favored an uncompromising restatement of Catholic doctrines in strict opposition to Protestant positions. The latter group won,
although not without a struggle.

The final doctrinal decrees of the Council of Trent reaffirmed traditional Catholic teachings in opposition to
Protestant beliefs. Scripture and tradition were affirmed as
equal authorities in religious matters; only the church could
interpret Scripture.Both faith and good works were declared
necessary for salvation. The seven sacraments, the Catholic
doctrine of transubstantiation (rejected by the Protestant
reformers), and clerical celibacy were all upheld. Belief in
purgatory and in the efficacy of indulgences was strengthened, although the hawking of indulgences was prohibited.

After the Council of Trent, the Roman Catholic Church,
with a clear body of doctrine, was a unified church under the
acknowledged supremacy of the popes who had triumphed
over bishops and councils. The Catholic church had become
one Christian denomination among many with an organizational framework and doctrinal pattern that would not be
significantly altered until the Second Vatican Council four
hundred years later.TheRomanCatholicChurchthus entered
a new phase of its history with a spirit of great confidence.

Politics and the Wars of Religion
in the Sixteenth Century

Q Focus Question: What role did politics, economic and
social conditions, and religion play in the European
wars of the sixteenth century?

By the middle of the sixteenth century, Calvinism and
Catholicism had become activist religions dedicated to
spreading the word of God as they interpreted it. Although
this religious struggle for the minds and hearts of Europeans
is at the core of the religious wars of the sixteenth century,
economic, social, and political forces also played important
roles in these conflicts. Of the sixteenth-century religious
wars, none were more momentous or more shattering than
the French civil wars known as the French Wars of Religion.

The French Wars of Religion (1562--1598)

Religion was the engine that drove the French civil wars of
the sixteenth century. The growth of Calvinism led to
persecution by the French kings but did little to stop the
spread of Calvinism. Huguenots, as the French Calvinists
were called, came from all layers of society: artisans and
shopkeepers hurt by rising prices and a rigid guild system,
merchants and lawyers in provincial towns whose local
privileges were tenuous, and members of the nobility.
Possibly half of the French nobility became Huguenots,
including the house of Bourbon, which stood next to the
Valois dynasty in the royal line of succession and ruled the
southern French kingdom of Navarre. The conversion of so
many nobles made the Huguenots a potentially dangerous
political threat to monarchical power. Though the Calvinists constituted only about 7 percent of the population, they
were a strong-willed and well-organized minority.

The Catholic majority greatly outnumbered the
Calvinist minority. The Valois monarchy was staunchly
Catholic, and its control of the Catholic church gave it
little incentive to look favorably on Protestantism. At the
same time, an extreme Catholic party---known as the
Ultra-Catholics---favored strict opposition to the Huguenots and were led by the Guise family. They received
support abroad from the papacy and the Jesuits, who
favored their uncompromising Catholic position.

But religion was not the only factor that contributed
to the French civil wars. Towns and provinces, which had
long resisted the growing power of monarchical centralization, were only too willing to join a revolt against the
monarchy. This was also true of the nobility, and the fact
that so many of them were Calvinists created an important
base of opposition to the crown. The French Wars of
Religion, then, presented a major constitutional crisis for
France and temporarily halted the development of the
French centralized state. The claim to a person’s loyalties
by the ruling dynasty was temporarily superseded by loyalty to one’s religious beliefs. For thirty years, battles raged
in France between Catholic and Calvinist parties, who
obviously considered the unity of France less important
than religious truth. But there also emerged in France a
group known as the politiques who placed politics before
religion and believed that no religious truth was worth the
ravages of civil war. The politiques ultimately prevailed, but
not until both sides had become exhausted by bloodshed.

Finally, in 1589, Henry of Navarre, the political leader
of the Huguenots and a member of the Bourbon dynasty,
succeeded to the throne as Henry IV (1589--1610). Realizing, however, that he would never be accepted by Catholic France, Henry took the logical way out and converted
to Catholicism. With his coronation in 1594, the Wars of
Religion came to an end. The Edict of Nantes in 1598
solved the religious problem by acknowledging Catholicism as the official religion of France while guaranteeing
the Huguenots the right to worship and to enjoy all political privileges, including the holding of public offices.

Philip II and Militant Catholicism

The greatest advocate of militant Catholicism in the
second half of the sixteenth century was King Philip II of
Spain (1556--1598), the son and heir of Charles V. Philip’s
reign ushered in an age of Spanish greatness, both
politically and culturally. Philip’s first major goal was to
consolidate and secure the lands he had inherited from
his father. These included Spain, the Netherlands, and
possessions in Italy and the New World. For Philip, this
meant strict conformity to Catholicism and the establishment of strong monarchical authority. Establishing
this authority was not an easy task because Philip had
inherited a governmental structure in which each of the
various states and territories of his empire stood in an
individual relationship to the king.

Crucial to an understanding of Philip II is the importance of Catholicism to the Spanish people and their
ruler. Driven by a heritage of crusading fervor, the
Spanish had little difficulty seeing themselves as a nation
divinely chosen to save Catholic Christianity from the
Protestant heretics. Philip II, the ‘‘Most Catholic King,’’
became the champion of Catholicism throughout Europe,
a role that led him to spectacular victories and equally
spectacular defeats. Spain’s leadership of a ‘‘holy league’’
against Turkish encroachments in the Mediterranean resulted in a stunning victory over the Turkish fleet in the
Battle of Lepanto in 1571. But Philip’s attempt to crush
the revolt in the Netherlands and his tortured policy with
England’s Queen Elizabeth led to his greatest misfortunes.

Revolt of the Netherlands

As one of the richest parts of Philip’s empire, the Spanish
Netherlands was of great importance to the ‘‘Most Catholic
King.’’ Philip’s attempt to strengthen his control in the
Netherlands, which consisted of seventeen provinces (modern Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg), soon led to a
revolt. The nobles, who stood to lose the most politically if
their jealously guarded privileges and freedoms were weakened, strongly opposed Philip’s efforts. Resentment against
Philip was also aroused by his use of taxes collected in the
Netherlands to further Spanish interests. Finally, religion
became a major catalyst for rebellion when Philip attempted
to crush Calvinism.Violence eruptedin 1566whenCalvinists---
many of them nobles---began to smash statues and stainedglass windows in Catholic churches. Philip responded by
sendingthe duke ofAlvawith ten thousand veteran Spanish
and Italian troops to crush the rebellion.

But the revolt became organized, especially in the
seven northern provinces, where the Dutch, under the
leadership of William of Nassau, the prince of Orange,
offered growing resistance. The struggle dragged on until 1609, when a
twelve-year truce ended
the war, virtually recognizing the independence
of the northern provinces.
These seven northern
provinces, which began to
call themselves the United
Provinces of the Netherlands in 1581, soon
emerged as the Dutch Republic, although the Spanish did
not formally recognize them as independent until 1648.
The ten southern provinces remained a Spanish possession.

The England of Elizabeth

After the death of Queen Mary in 1558, her half-sister
Elizabeth, the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn,
ascended the throne of England. During Elizabeth’s reign,
England rose to prominence as the relatively small island
kingdom became the leader of the Protestant nations of
Europe and laid the foundations for a world empire.

Intelligent, cautious, and self-confident, Elizabeth
moved quickly to solve the difficult religious problem she
inherited from her half-sister. Elizabeth’s religious policy was
based on moderation and compromise (see the box on
p. 285). The Catholic laws of Mary’s reign were repealed,
and the new Act of Supremacy designated Elizabeth as ‘‘the
only supreme governor’’ of both church and state. She used
this title rather than ‘‘supreme head of the church,’’ which
had been used by both Henry VIII and Edward VI, because
she did not want to upset Catholics, who considered the
pope the supreme head, or radical Protestants, who thought
that Christ alone was head of the church. The church service
used during the reign of Edward VI was revised to make it
more acceptable to Catholics. The Church of England under
Elizabeth was basically Protestant, but of a moderate sort
that kept most of the queen’s subjects satisfied.

Caution, moderation, and expediency also dictated
Elizabeth’s foreign policy. Fearful of other countries’ motives,
Elizabeth realized that war could be disastrous for her island
kingdom and her own rule. While encouraging English
piracy and providing clandestine aid to French Huguenots
and Dutch Calvinists to weaken France and Spain, Elizabeth
pretended complete aloofness and avoided alliances that
would force her into war with any major power. Gradually,
however, Elizabeth was drawn into conflict with Spain. After
years of resisting the idea of invading England as too impractical, Spain’s Philip II was finally persuaded to do so by
advisers who assured him that the people of England would
rise against their queen when the Spaniards arrived.
A successful invasion of England would mean the overthrow
of heresy and the return of England to Catholicism, surely
an act in accordance with the will of God. Philip therefore
ordered preparations for an armada (fleet of warships) to
spearhead the invasion of England in 1588.

The armada proved a disaster. The Spanish fleet that
finally set sail had neither the ships nor the troops that
Philip had planned to send. A conversation between a
papal emissary and an officer of the Spanish fleet before
the armada departed reveals the fundamental flaw:

‘‘And if you meet the English armada in the Channel, do you
expect to win the battle?’’
‘‘Of course,’’ replied the Spaniard.
‘‘How can you be so sure?’’ [asked the emissary.]
‘‘It’s very simple. It is well known that we fight in God’s
cause. So, when we meet the English, God will surely arrange
matters so that we can grapple and board them, either by
sending some strange streak of weather, or, more likely, just by
depriving the English of their wits. If we can come to close
quarters, Spanish valor and Spanish steel (and the great masses
of soldiers we shall have on board) will make our victory certain. But unless God helps us by a miracle the English, who
have faster and handier ships than ours, and many more longrange guns, and who know their advantage just as well as we
do, will never close with us at all, but stand aloof and knock
us to pieces with their culverins [cannons], without our being
able to do them any serious hurt. So,’’ concluded the captain,
and one fancies a grim smile, ‘‘we are sailing against England
in the confident hope of a miracle.’’12

The hoped-for miracle never materialized. The
Spanish fleet, battered by a number of encounters with
the English, sailed back to Spain by a northward route
around Scotland and Ireland along which it was further
ravaged by storms. Although the English and Spanish
would continue their war for another sixteen years, the
defeat of the Spanish armada guaranteed for the time
being that England would remain a Protestant country.
Although Spain made up for its losses within a year and
a half, the defeat was a psychological blow to the
Spaniards.

CONCLUSION

When the Augustinian monk Martin Luther burst onto the scene
with a series of theses objecting to indulgences, few people
suspected that his observations would eventually split all of Europe
along religious lines. But the yearning for reform of the church and
meaningful religious experience caused a seemingly simple dispute
to escalate into a powerful movement.
Although Luther felt that his revival of Christianity based on
his interpretation of the Bible should be acceptable to all, others
soon appeared who also read the Bible but interpreted it in different
ways. Protestantism fragmented into a number of sects, which,
though united in their dislike of Catholicism, were themselves
divided over the interpretation of the sacraments and religious
practices. As reform ideas spread, religion and politics became ever
more intertwined.
By 1555, Lutheranism had lost much of its momentum;
its energy was largely replaced by the new Calvinist form
of Protestantism, which had a clarity of doctrine and a fervor
that made it attractive to a whole new generation of Europeans.
Although Calvinism’s militancy enabled it to expand across Europe,
Catholicism was also experiencing its own revival and emerged as a
militant faith. This age of religious passion was followed by an age
of religious warfare.
That people who were disciples of the Apostle of Peace would
kill each other over their beliefs aroused skepticism about
Christianity itself. As one German writer put it, ‘‘Lutheran, popish,
and Calvinistic, we’ve got all these beliefs here; but there is some
doubt about where Christianity has got.’’13 It is surely no accident
that the search for a stable, secular order of politics and for order in
the universe through natural laws soon came to play important
roles. Before we look at this search for order in the seventeenth
century, however, we need first to look at the adventures that
plunged Europe into its new role in the world.
