<h2 id="org292c4d3">13 A sixteenth-century engraving of Martin Luther in front of Charles V at the Diet of Worms</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org292c4d3">
<p class="verse">
On April 18, 1521,<br />
&#xa0;a lowly monk stood before the emperor and princes of the Holy Roman Empire in the city of Worms.<br />
He had been called before this august gathering to answer charges of heresy,<br />
&#xa0;charges that could threaten his very life.<br />
The monk was confronted with a pile of his books<br />
&#xa0;and asked if he wished to defend them all or reject a part.<br />
Courageously, Martin Luther defended them all<br />
&#xa0;and asked to be shown where any part was in error on the basis of Scripture and plain reason.<br />
The emperor was outraged by Luther's response and made his own position clear the next day:<br />
'Not only I, but you of this noble German nation, would be forever disgraced<br />
&#xa0;if by our negligence not only heresy but the very suspicion of heresy were to survive.<br />
After having heard yesterday the obstinate defense of Luther,<br />
&#xa0;I regret that I have so long delayed in proceeding against him and his false teaching.<br />
I will have no more to do with him.'<br />
Luther's appearance at Worms<br />
&#xa0;set the stage for a serious challenge to the authority of the Catholic church.<br />
This was by no means the first crisis in the church's fifteen-hundred-year history,<br />
&#xa0;but its consequences were more far-reaching than anyone at Worms in 1521 could have imagined.<br />
<br />
Throughout the Middle Ages,<br />
&#xa0;the medieval Christian church continued to assert its primacy of position.<br />
It had overcome defiance of its temporal authority by emperors and kings<br />
&#xa0;while challenges to its doctrines had been crushed by the Inquisition<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and combated by new religious orders<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;that carried its message of salvation to all the towns and villages of medieval Europe.<br />
The growth of the papacy had paralleled the growth of the church,<br />
&#xa0;but by the end of the Middle Ages,<br />
&#xa0;challenges to papal authority from the rising power of monarchical states<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;had resulted in a loss of papal temporal authority.<br />
An even greater threat to papal authority and church unity arose in the sixteenth century<br />
&#xa0;when the unity of Christendom was shattered by the Reformation.<br />
<br />
The movement begun by Martin Luther when he made his dramatic stand quickly spread across Europe,<br />
&#xa0;a clear indication of dissatisfaction with Catholic practices.<br />
Within a short time, new religious practices, doctrines, and organizations,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;including Zwinglianism, Calvinism, Anabaptism, and Anglicanism,<br />
&#xa0;were attracting adherents all over Europe.<br />
Seemingly helpless to stop the new Protestant churches,<br />
&#xa0;the Roman Catholic Church underwent a reformation<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and managed to revive its fortunes by the mid-sixteenth century.<br />
Nevertheless,<br />
&#xa0;the doctrinal divisions between Protestants and Catholics<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;became instrumental in triggering a series of religious wars<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;that dominated the history of western Europe in the second half of the sixteenth century.<br />
