<p class="verse">
Many Europeans after 1894 continued to believe they lived in an era of material and human progress.<br />
For some, however, progress entailed much struggle.<br />
Emmeline Pankhurst, who became the leader of the women's suffrage movement in Britain,<br />
&#xa0;said that her determination to fight for women's rights stemmed from a childhood memory:<br />
&#xa0;My father bent over me, shielding the candle flame with his big hand,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and I heard him say, somewhat sadly, 'What a pity she wasn't born a lad.'<br />
Eventually, Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughters marched and fought for women's right to vote.<br />
The struggle was often violent:<br />
&#xa0;'They came in bruised, hatless, faces scratched, eyes swollen, noses bleeding,'<br />
&#xa0;one of the Pankhurst daughters recalled.<br />
Arrested and jailed in 1908, Pankhurst informed her judges,<br />
&#xa0;'If you had the power to send us to prison,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;not for six months, but for six years, or for our lives,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;the Government must not think they could stop this agitation.<br />
It would go on!'<br />
It did go on, and women in Britain did eventually receive the right to vote;<br />
&#xa0;to some, this was yet another confirmation of Europe's progress.<br />
<br />
But the period after 1894 was not just a time of progress;<br />
&#xa0;it was also a time of great tension<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;as imperialist adventures, international rivalries,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;and cultural uncertainties disturbed the apparent calm.<br />
After 1880, Europeans engaged in a great race for colonies around the world.<br />
This competition for lands abroad greatly intensified existing antagonisms among European states.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, Europeans proved incapable of finding constructive ways<br />
&#xa0;to cope with their international rivalries.<br />
The development of two large alliance systems&#x2014;the Triple Alliance and the Triple Entente&#x2014;<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;may have helped preserve peace for a time,<br />
&#xa0;but eventually the alliances made it easier for the European nations<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;to be drawn into the catastrophic carnage of World War I.<br />
<br />
The cultural life of Europe in the decades before 1914 reflects similar dynamic tensions.<br />
The advent of mass education produced better-informed citizens<br />
&#xa0;but also made it easier for governments<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;to stir up the masses by nationalistic appeals through the new mass journalism.<br />
At the same time, despite the appearance of progress,<br />
&#xa0;European philosophers, writers, and artists were advancing cultural expressions<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that questioned traditional ideas and values and undermined public confidence.<br />
Leading up to 1914,<br />
&#xa0;many intellectuals had a sense of unease about the direction in which society was heading<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and a feeling of imminent catastrophe.<br />
They proved remarkably prophetic.<br />
