<p class="verse">
The French Revolution dramatically altered the political structure of France;<br />
&#xa0;the Napoleonic conquests then spread many of the revolutionary principles to other parts of Europe.<br />
At the same time, during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries,<br />
&#xa0;another revolution&#x2014;an industrial one&#x2014;<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;was transforming the economic and social structure of Europe,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;although somewhat less radically and rapidly.<br />
<br />
The Industrial Revolution initiated a quantum leap in industrial production.<br />
New sources of energy and power, especially coal and steam,<br />
&#xa0;replaced wind and water to run laborsaving machines<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that dramatically decreased the use of human and animal muscle power<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;and at the same time increased productivity.<br />
This, in turn, called for new ways of organizing human labor<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;to maximize the benefits and profits from the new machines<br />
&#xa0;as factories replaced artisanal workshops and the cottage industry.<br />
Many early factories were dreadful places with difficult working conditions.<br />
Reformers, appalled at these conditions,<br />
&#xa0;were especially critical of the treatment of married women.<br />
One reported,<br />
&#xa0;'We have repeatedly seen married females,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;in the last stage of pregnancy, slaving from morning to night beside these never-tiring machines,<br />
&#xa0;and when they were obliged to sit down to take a moment's ease,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;and being seen by the manager,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;were fined for the offense.'<br />
But some factories were well run.<br />
William Cobbett described one in Manchester in 1830:<br />
&#xa0;'In this room, which is lighted in the most convenient and beautiful manner,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;there were five hundred pairs of looms at work,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;and five hundred persons attending those looms;<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;and, owing to the goodness of the masters, the whole looking healthy and well-dressed.'<br />
<br />
During the Industrial Revolution,<br />
&#xa0;Europe experienced a shift from a traditional, labor-intensive economy<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;based on farming and handicrafts<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;to a more capital-intensive economy<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;based on manufacturing by machines, specialized labor, and industrial factories.<br />
Although the Industrial Revolution took decades to spread,<br />
&#xa0;it was truly revolutionary in the way<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;it fundamentally changed Europeans, their society, and their relationship to other peoples.<br />
The development of large factories encouraged mass movements of people from the countryside to urban areas<br />
&#xa0;where impersonal coexistence replaced the traditional intimacy of rural life.<br />
Higher levels of productivity led to a search for new sources of raw materials,<br />
&#xa0;new consumption patterns,<br />
&#xa0;and a revolution in transportation<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that allowed raw materials and finished products to be moved quickly around the world.<br />
The rise of a wealthy industrial middle class<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and a huge industrial working class (or proletariat)<br />
&#xa0;substantially transformed traditional social relationships.<br />
