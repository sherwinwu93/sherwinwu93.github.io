IN THE 1920S, MANY PEOPLE in the West assumed that
they were about to enter a new era of world peace, economic
growth, and political democracy. In all of these areas, the optimistic
hopes of the 1920s failed to be realized. After 1919, most people
wanted peace but were unsure about how to maintain it. The League
of Nations, conceived as a new instrument to provide for collective
security, failed to work well. New treaties that renounced the use of
war looked good on paper but had no means of enforcement. Virtually everyone favored disarmament, but few could agree on how to
achieve it.
Europe faced severe economic and social challenges after World
War I. The European economy did not begin to recover from the
war until 1922, and even then it was beset by financial problems left
over from the war and, most devastating of all, the severe economic
crisis that began at the end of 1929. The Great Depression brought
untold misery to millions of people. Begging for food on the streets
became widespread, especially when soup kitchens were unable to
keep up with the demand. Larger and larger numbers of people
were homeless and moved from place to place looking for work and
shelter. In the United States, the homeless set up shantytowns they
named ‘‘Hoovervilles’’ after the American president, Herbert Hoover.
In their misery, some people saw but one solution, as one unemployed person expressed it: ‘‘Today, when I am experiencing this for
the first time, I think that I should prefer to do away with myself, to
take gas, to jump into the river, or leap from some high place.. . .
Would I really come to such a decision? I do not know. Animals die,
plants wither, but men always go on living.’’ Social unrest spread
rapidly, and some of the vast numbers of unemployed staged hunger
marches to get attention. In democratic countries, more and more
people began to listen to and vote for radical voices calling for
extreme measures.
According to U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, World War I
had been fought to make the world safe for democracy, and for a
while after 1919, political democracy seemed well established. But
hope soon faded as authoritarian regimes spread into Italy and
Germany and across eastern Europe.
An Uncertain Peace:
The Search for Security
Q Focus Question: What problems did European
countries face immediately after World War I, and
what impact did the Great Depression have on those
problems?
Wilson recognized that the peace treaties ending World
War I contained unwise provisions that could serve as
new causes for conflicts, and he placed his hopes for
ensuring the future in the League of Nations. The League,
however, was not particularly good at maintaining the
peace. The failure of the United States to join the League
and the subsequent American retreat into isolationism
undermined the League’s effectiveness from the very start.
Moreover, the League’s sole weapon for halting aggression
was economic sanctions.
The French Policy of Coercion, 1919--1924
The weakness of the League of Nations and the failure of
both the United States and Great Britain to honor their
promises to form defensive military alliances with France
left France embittered and alone. France’s search for security between 1919 and 1924 was founded primarily on a
strict enforcement of the Treaty of Versailles. This tough
policy toward Germany began with the issue of reparations, the payments that the Germans were to make to
compensate for the ‘‘damage done to the civilian population of the Allied and Associated Powers and to their
property,’’ as the treaty asserted. In April 1921, the Allied
Reparations Commission settled on a sum of 132 billion
marks ($33 billion) for German reparations, payable in
annual installments of 2.5 billion (gold) marks. The new
German republic made its first payment in 1921, but by
the following year, facing financial problems, it announced that it was unable to pay more. Outraged by
what it considered Germany’s violation of the peace settlement, the French government sent troops to occupy
the Ruhr valley, Germany’s chief industrial and mining
center. Because the Germans would not pay reparations,
the French would collect reparations in kind by operating
and using the Ruhr mines and factories.
Both Germany and France suffered from the French
occupation of the Ruhr. The German government adopted
a policy of passive resistance that was largely financed by
printing more paper money, but this only intensified
the inflationary pressures that had already appeared in
Germany by the end of the war. The German mark soon
became worthless. In 1914, one U.S. dollar bought 4.2
marks; by the end of November 1923, a dollar bought an
incredible 4.2 trillion marks. Germany faced total economic collapse. The formation of new governments in
both Great Britain and France opened the door to conciliatory approaches to Germany and the reparations
problem. At the same time, a new German government led
by Gustav Stresemann (1878--1929) ended the policy of
passive resistance and committed Germany to seek a new
settlement of the reparations question.
The Hopeful Years, 1924--1929
In August 1924, an international commission produced a
new plan for reparations. Named the Dawes Plan after the
American banker who chaired the commission, it reduced
reparations and stabilized Germany’s payments on the basis
of its ability to pay. The Dawes Plan also granted an initial
$200 million loan for German recovery, which opened the
door to heavy American investments in Europe that helped
create a glimmer of European prosperity between 1924
and 1929.
With prosperity came a new spate of European diplomacy. A spirit of cooperation was fostered by Stresemann, the foreign minister of Germany, and his French
counterpart, Aristide Briand (1862--1932), who concluded the Treaty of Locarno in 1925. This guaranteed
Germany’s new western borders with France and Belgium.
Although Germany’s new eastern borders with Poland
were conspicuously absent from the agreement, the
Locarno pact was viewed by many as the beginning of a
new era of European peace. On the day after the pact was
concluded, the headlines in the New York Times read
‘‘France and Germany Ban War Forever,’’ and the London
Times declared ‘‘Peace at Last.’’1
The spirit of Locarno was based on little real substance, however. Germany lacked the military power to
alter its western borders even if it wanted to. And the
issue of disarmament soon proved that even the spirit of
Locarno could not bring nations to cut back on their
weapons. The League of Nations had suggested the
‘‘reduction of national armaments to the lowest point
consistent with national safety.’’ Germany, of course, had
been disarmed with the expectation that other states
would do likewise. Numerous disarmament conferences,
however, failed to achieve anything substantial as states
proved unwilling to trust their security to anyone but
their own military forces.
The Great Depression
Two factors played a major role in the coming of the
Great Depression: a downturn in domestic economies
and an international financial crisis precipitated by the
collapse of the American stock market in 1929. In the
mid-1920s, prices for agricultural goods were beginning
to decline rapidly due to overproduction of basic commodities, such as wheat, and an increase in the use of oil
and hydroelectricity led to a slump in the coal industry. In
addition to these domestic economic troubles, much of
the European prosperity between 1924 and 1929 had been
built on American bank loans to Germany. In 1928 and
1929, American investors began to pull money out of
Germany in order to invest in the booming New York
stock market. The crash of the stock market in October
1929 led panicky American investors to withdraw even
more of their funds from Germany and other European
markets. The withdrawal of funds seriously weakened the
banks of Germany and other central European states.
The Credit-Anstalt, Vienna’s most prestigious bank, collapsed on May 31, 1931. By that time, trade was slowing
down, industrialists were cutting back production, and
unemployment was increasing as the ripple effects of
international bank failures had a devastating impact on
domestic economies.
Economic depression was not a new phenomenon in
European history, but the depth of the economic downturn after 1929 fully justifies calling it the Great Depression. During 1932, the worst year of the depression, 25
percent of the British and 40 percent of the German labor
force was out of work. The unemployed and homeless
filled the streets of the cities throughout the industrialized
countries (see the box on p. 561).
The economic crisis also had unexpected social repercussions. Women were often able to secure low-paying
jobs as servants, housecleaners, or laundresses while many
men remained unemployed, either begging on the streets
or staying at home to do household tasks. This reversal of
traditional gender roles caused resentment on the part of
many unemployed men, opening them to the shrill cries
of demagogues with simple solutions to the economic
crisis. High unemployment rates among young males
often led them to join gangs that gathered in parks or
other public places, spreading fear among local residents.
Governments seemed powerless to deal with the
crisis. The classical liberal remedy for depression, a deflationary policy of balanced budgets, which involved
cutting costs by lowering wages and raising tariffs to exclude other countries’ goods from home markets, served
only to worsen the economic crisis and create even greater
mass discontent. This in turn led to serious political repercussions. Increased government activity in the economy
was one reaction, even in countries like the United States
that had a strong laissez-faire tradition. Another effect was
a renewed interest in Marxist doctrines since Marx had
predicted that capitalism would destroy itself through
overproduction. Communism took on new popularity,
especially among workers and intellectuals. Finally, the
Great Depression increased the attractiveness of simplistic
solutions, especially from a new authoritarian movement
known as fascism. Everywhere, democracy seemed on the
defensive in the 1930s.
The Democratic States
Q Focus Question: How did France, Great Britain, and
the United States respond to the various crises that
they faced in the interwar years, and how did those
crises affect Europe’s colonial empires?
After World War I, Great Britain went through a period
of serious economic difficulties. During the war, Britain
had lost many of the markets for its industrial products,
especially to the United States and Japan. The postwar
decline of such staple industries as coal, steel, and
textiles led to a rise in unemployment, which reached
the two million mark in 1921. But Britain soon rebounded and from 1925 to 1929 experienced renewed
prosperity.
But Britain was not immune to the effects of the
Great Depression. The Labour Party, now the largest
party in Britain, failed to solve the nation’s economic
problems and fell from power in 1931. A national government (a coalition of Liberals and Conservatives)
claimed credit for bringing Britain out of the worst stages
of the depression, primarily by using the traditional
policies of balanced budgets and protective tariffs. British
politicians largely ignored the new ideas of a Cambridge
economist, John Maynard Keynes (1883--1946), who
published A General Theory of Employment, Interest and
Money in 1936. He condemned the traditional view that
in a free economy, depressions should be left to work
themselves out. Instead, Keynes argued that unemployment stemmed not from overproduction but from a
decline in demand and that demand could be increased
by public works, financed, if necessary, through deficit
spending to stimulate production.
After the defeat of Germany, France had become the
strongest power on the European continent. Its greatest
need was to rebuild the devastated areas of northern and
eastern France. But no French government seemed capable of solving France’s financial problems between 1921
and 1926. Like other European countries, though, France
did experience a period of relative prosperity between
1926 and 1929. By 1932, France began to feel the full
effects of the Great Depression, and economic instability
soon had political repercussions. During a nineteenmonth period in 1932 and 1933, six different cabinets
were formed as France faced political chaos. Finally, in
1936, fearful that rightists intended to seize power, a
coalition of leftist parties---Communists, Socialists, and
Radicals---formed a Popular Front government.
Although the Popular Front succeeded in initiating
a program for workers that established the right of
collective bargaining, a forty-hour workweek, two-week
paid vacations, and minimum wages, its policies failed
to solve the problems of the depression. By 1938, the
French were experiencing a serious decline of confidence in their political system that left them unprepared
to deal with their aggressive enemy to the east, Nazi
Germany.
After Germany, no Western nation was more affected by the Great Depression than the United States.
By the end of 1932, industrial production had fallen to
50 percent of what it had been in 1929. Soon there were
fifteen million unemployed. Under these circumstances,
the Democrat Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882--1945)
won the 1932 presidential election by a landslide.
He and his advisers pursued a policy of active government intervention in the economy that came to be
known as the New Deal, which included a stepped-up
program of public works, such as the Works Progress
Administration (WPA), established in 1935. This government organization put between two and three million people to work building bridges, roads, post offices,
and airports. The Roosevelt administration was also
responsible for social legislation that launched the
American welfare state. In 1935, the Social Security Act
created a system of old-age pensions and unemployment
insurance.
No doubt the New Deal provided some social reform
measures that perhaps averted the possibility of social
revolution in the United States. It did not, however, solve
the unemployment problems of the Great Depression. In
May 1937, during what was considered a period of full
recovery, American unemployment still stood at seven
million; by the following year, it had increased to eleven
million. Only World War II and the subsequent growth of
armament-related industries brought American workers
back to full employment.
European States and the World:
The Colonial Empires
World War I and the Great Depression had an impact on
Europe’s colonial empires. Despite the war, the Allied
nations had managed to keep their colonial empires
intact. Great Britain and France had even added to
their empires by dividing up many of Germany’s colonial possessions and taking control of large parts of
the Middle East through a system of mandates. Although Europe had emerged from World War I relatively
intact, its political and social foundations and its selfconfidence had been severely undermined. In Asia and
Africa, a rising tide of unrest against European political
domination began to emerge and led to movements for
change.
The Middle East For the countries of the Middle East,
the period between the two world wars was a time of
transition. With the fall of the Ottoman and Persian
Empires, new modernizing regimes emerged in Turkey
and Iran. A fiercely independent government was established in Saudi Arabia in 1932. Iraq, too, gained its independence from Britain in the same year. Elsewhere in
the Middle East, European influence remained strong: the
British maintained their mandates in Jordan and Palestine, the French in Syria and Lebanon.
Although Britain and France had made plans to divide up Ottoman territories in the Middle East, Colonel
Mustafa Kemal led Turkish forces in creating the new
republic of Turkey in 1923. Kemal wanted to modernize
Turkey along Western lines. The trappings of a democratic system were put in place, although the new president did not tolerate opposition. Kemal, who adopted the
surname Atatu¨rk (‘‘Father Turk’’), made Turkey a secular
republic and broke the power of the Islamic religion. By
and large, the Turkish republic was the product of Atatu¨rk’s determined efforts to use nationalism and Western
ways to create a modern Turkish nation from the Ottoman
remnants in Asia Minor.
India By the time of World War I, the Indian people had
already begun to refer to Mohandas Gandhi as India’s
‘‘Great Soul,’’ or Mahatma. Gandhi (1869--1948) spearheaded a movement based on nonviolent resistance,
whose aim was to force the British to improve the lot of
the poor and grant independence to India. When the
British tried to suppress Indian calls for independence,
Gandhi called on his followers to pursue a peaceful policy
of civil disobedience by refusing to obey British regulations. Although the British resisted Gandhi’s movement,
in 1935 they granted India internal self-government.
Independence, however, would have to wait until after
World War II.
Africa Black Africans who fought in World War I in the
armies of the British and the French hoped for independence after the war. As one newspaper in the Gold
Coast put it, if African volunteers who fought on European battlefields were ‘‘good enough to fight and die in
the Empire’s cause, they were good enough to have a
share in the government of their countries.’’ This feeling
was shared by many. The peace settlement after World
War I, then, turned out to be a great disappointment.
Germany was stripped of its African colonies, but they
were awarded to the British and the French.
After World War I, Africans became more active
politically. Africans who had fought in World War I had
learned new ideas in the West about freedom and nationalism. Even in Africa itself, missionary schools had
often taught their African pupils ideas about liberty and
equality. As more Africans became aware of the enormous
gulf between Western ideals and practices, they decided to
seek reform. Independence remained but a dream. Although the colonial powers responded to protest movements with force, they also began to make some reforms
in the hope of satisfying indigenous peoples. Reforms,
however, were too few and too late, and by the 1930s, an
increasing number of African leaders were calling for
independence. The clearest calls came from a new generation of young African leaders who had been educated
in Europe and the United States.
The Authoritarian
and Totalitarian States
Q Focus Questions: Why did many European states
experience a retreat from democracy in the interwar
years? What are the characteristics of totalitarian
states, and to what degree were these characteristics
present in Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, and Stalinist
Russia?
The apparent triumph of liberal democracy in 1919
proved extremely short-lived. By 1939, only two major
states (Great Britain and France) and several minor ones
(the Low Countries, the Scandinavian states, Switzerland, and Czechoslovakia) remained democratic. What
had happened to Woodrow Wilson’s claim that World
War I had been fought to make the world safe for democracy? Actually, the impact of World War I had the
opposite effect.
The Retreat from Democracy
The postwar expansion of the electorate made mass politics a reality and seemed to enhance the spread of democracy in Europe. But the war itself created conditions
that led the new mass electorate to distrust democracy and
move toward a more radicalized politics.
Many postwar societies were badly divided, especially
along class lines. During the war, governments had been
forced to make concessions to trade unions and socialist
parties in order to maintain war production, which
strengthened the working class after the war. At the same
time, the position of many middle-class people had declined as consumer industries had been curtailed during
the war and war bonds, which had been purchased by the
middle classes as their patriotic contribution to the war
effort, sank in value and even became worthless in some
countries.
Gender divisions also weakened social cohesion.
After the war, as soldiers returned home, women were
forced out of jobs they had taken during the war, jobs that
many newly independent women wanted to retain. The
loss of so many men during the war had also left many
younger women with no marital prospects and widows
with no choice but to find jobs in the labor force. At the
same time, fears about a declining population because of
the war led many male political leaders to encourage
women to return to their traditional roles of wives and
mothers. Many European countries outlawed abortions
and curtailed the sale of birth control devices while
providing increased welfare benefits to entice women to
remain at home and bear children.
The Great Depression served to deepen social conflict. Larger and larger numbers of people felt victimized, first by the war and now by socioeconomic
conditions that seemed beyond their control. Postwar
politics became more and more polarized as people reverted to the wartime practice of dividing into friends
and enemies, downplaying compromise, and emphasizing conflict. Moderate centrist parties that supported
democracy soon found themselves with fewer and fewer
allies as people became increasingly radicalized politically, supporting the extremes of left-wing communism
or right-wing fascism. In the 1920s, Italy had become the
first fascist state, while the newborn Soviet Union drifted
toward a repressive totalitarian state. In the 1930s, a
host of other European nations adopted authoritarian
structures of various kinds.
The dictatorial regimes between the wars assumed
both old and new forms. Dictatorship was not new, but
the modern totalitarian state was. The totalitarian regimes,
best exemplified by Stalinist Russia and Nazi Germany,
greatly extended the functions and powers of the central
government. The modern totalitarian state expected the
active commitment of citizens to the regime’s goals. They
used modern mass propaganda techniques and highspeed communication media to conquer the minds and
hearts of their subjects. The total state sought to control
not only the economic, political, and social aspects of life
but the intellectual and cultural aspects as well.
The modern totalitarian state was to be led by a
single leader and a single party. It ruthlessly rejected the
liberal ideal of limited government power and constitutional guarantees of individual freedoms. Indeed, individual freedom was to be subordinated to the collective
will of the masses, organized and determined for them by
their leader. Modern technology also gave total states
unprecedented police controls to enforce their wishes on
their subjects.
Fascist Italy
In the early 1920s, Benito Mussolini burst onto the Italian
scene with the first fascist movement in Europe. Mussolini
(1883--1945) began his political career as a socialist, but in
1919, he established a new political group, the Fascio di
Combattimento, or League of Combat. It received little
attention in the elections of 1919, but political stalemate
in Italy’s parliamentary system and strong nationalist
sentiment gave Mussolini and the Fascists the opportunity
to rise to power.
The new parliament elected in November quickly
proved incapable of governing Italy. The three major
parties were unable to form an effective governmental
coalition, and the Socialists, now the largest party, spoke
theoretically of the need for revolution and alarmed
conservatives, who quickly associated them with Bolsheviks (Communists) in Russia. Thousands of industrial and agricultural strikes in 1919 and 1920 created a
climate of class warfare and continual violence. In 1920
and 1921, bands of armed Fascists called squadristi were
formed and turned loose in attacks on socialist offices
and newspapers. Strikes by trade unionists and socialist
workers and peasant leagues were broken up by force.
Mussolini’s Fascist movement began to gain support
from middle-class industrialists fearful of working-class
agitation and large landowners who objected to the
agricultural strikes. Mussolini also perceived that Italians
were angry over the failure of Italy to receive more territorial acquisitions after World War I. By 1922, the
movement began to mushroom as Mussolini’s nationalist rhetoric and the middle-class fear of socialism,
Communist revolution, and disorder made the Fascists
seem attractive. On October 29, 1922, after Mussolini
and the Fascists threatened to march on Rome if they
were not given power, King Victor Emmanuel III (1900--
1946) capitulated and made Mussolini prime minister
of Italy.
Mussolini and the Italian Fascist State By 1926,
Mussolini had established a Fascist dictatorship. Press
laws gave the government the right to suspend any publications that fostered disrespect for the Catholic church,
the monarchy, or the state. The prime minister was made
‘‘head of government,’’ with the power to legislate by
decree. A police law empowered the police to arrest and
confine anybody for political or nonpolitical crimes
without due process of law. In 1926, all antifascist parties
were outlawed, and a secret police force, known as the
OVRA, was established. By the end of 1926, Mussolini
ruled Italy as Il Duce, ‘‘the leader.’’
Mussolini conceived of the Fascist state as totalitarian:
‘‘Fascism is totalitarian, and the Fascist State, the synthesis
and unity of all values, interprets, develops and gives
strength to the whole life of the people.’’2 Mussolini did
try to create a police state, but police activities in Italy
were never as repressive, efficient, or savage as those of
Nazi Germany. Likewise, the Italian Fascists’ attempt to
exercise control over all forms of mass media, including
newspapers, radio, and cinema, in order to use propaganda as an instrument to integrate the masses into the
state failed to achieve its major goals. Most commonly,
Fascist propaganda was disseminated through simple
slogans, such as ‘‘Mussolini is always right,’’ plastered on
walls all over Italy.
Mussolini and the Fascists also attempted to mold Italians into a single-minded community by developing Fascist
organizations. Because the secondary schools maintained
considerable freedom from Fascist control, the regime
relied more and more on the activities of youth organizations, known as the Young Fascists, to indoctrinate the
young people of the nation in Fascist ideals. By 1939,
nearly seven million children and young adults of both
sexes---two-thirds of the population between eight and
eighteen---were enrolled in some kind of Fascist youth
group. Activities for these groups included Saturday afternoon marching drills and calisthenics, seaside and
mountain summer camps, and contests. Beginning in
the 1930s, all male groups were given military exercises
to develop discipline and provide training for war. Results were mixed. Italian teenagers, who liked neither
military training nor routine discipline of any kind, simply
refused to attend Fascist youth group meetings on a regular
basis.
The Fascists portrayed the family as the pillar of the
state and women as the basic foundation of the family.
‘‘Woman into the home’’ became the Fascist slogan.
Women were to be homemakers and baby producers,
‘‘their natural and fundamental mission in life,’’ according
to Mussolini, who viewed population growth as an indicator of national strength. Employment outside the home
distracted women from reproduction. ‘‘It forms an independence and consequent physical and moral habits
contrary to child bearing.’’3 A practical consideration also
underlay the Fascist attitude toward women: eliminating
women from the job market reduced male unemployment
figures in the depression economy of the 1930s.
Despite the instruments of repression, the use of
propaganda, and the creation of numerous Fascist organizations, Mussolini never achieved the degree of
totalitarian control accomplished in Hitler’s Germany or
Stalin’s Soviet Union. Mussolini and the Fascist party
never really destroyed the old power structure. Some
institutions, including the armed forces and the monarchy, were never absorbed into the Fascist state and
managed to maintain their independence. Mussolini had
boasted that he would help workers and peasants, but
instead he generally allied himself with the interests of
industrialists and large landowners at the expense of the
lower classes.
Even more indicative of Mussolini’s compromise
with the traditional institutions of Italy was his attempt to
gain the support of the Catholic church. In the Lateran
Accords of February 1929, Mussolini’s regime recognized
the sovereign independence of a small enclave of 109 acres
in Rome, known as Vatican City, which had remained in
the church’s possession since the unification of Italy in
1870; in return, the papacy recognized the Italian state.
The Lateran Accords also guaranteed the church a large
grant of money and recognized Catholicism as the ‘‘sole
religion of the state.’’ In return, the Catholic church urged
Italians to support the Fascist regime.
In all areas of Italian life under Mussolini and the
Fascists, there was a dichotomy between Fascist ideals and
practice. The Italian Fascists promised much but actually
delivered considerably less, and they were soon overshadowed by a much more powerful fascist movement to
the north.
Hitler and Nazi Germany
In 1923, a small rightist party known as the Nazis, led by
an obscure Austrian rabble-rouser named Adolf Hitler,
tried to seize power in southern Germany. Although the
attempt failed, Hitler and the Nazis achieved sudden
national prominence. Within ten years, they had taken
over complete power.
Weimar Germany After Germany’s defeat in World War I,
a German democratic state known as the Weimar Republic was established. From its beginnings, the Weimar
Republic was plagued by problems. The republic had no
truly outstanding political leaders. In 1925, Paul von
Hindenburg (1847--1934), a World War I military hero,
was elected president. Hindenburg was a traditional
military man, monarchist in sentiment, who at heart was
not in favor of the republic. The young republic also
suffered politically from attempted uprisings and attacks
from both the left and right.
The Weimar Republic also faced serious economic
difficulties. As Germany experienced runaway inflation in
1922 and 1923, middle-class Germans and others who
lived on fixed incomes watched their monthly stipends
become worthless and their savings evaporate. These
economic losses increasingly pushed the middle class
toward rightist parties that were hostile to the republic.
To make matters worse, after a short recovery between
1924 and 1929, the Great Depression hit Germany hard.
Unemployment increased to nearly 4.4 million people by
December 1930. The depression fanned social discontent
and fear and paved the way for extremist parties. The
political, economic, and social problems of the Weimar
Republic provided an environment in which Hitler and
the Nazis were able to seize power.
Rise of the Nazis Born in 1889, Adolf Hitler was the
son of an Austrian customs official. He was a total failure
in secondary school and eventually made his way to
Vienna to become an artist. In Vienna, Hitler established
the basic ideas of an ideology from which he never deviated for the rest of his life. At the core of Hitler’s ideas
was racism, especially anti-Semitism. Hitler had also become an extreme German nationalist who had learned
from the mass politics of Vienna how political parties
could make effective use of propaganda and terror.
Finally, in his Viennese years, Hitler came to a firm belief
in the need for struggle, which he saw as the ‘‘granite
foundation of the world.’’
At the end of World War I, after four years of service
on the Western Front, Hitler went to Munich and decided to enter politics. He joined the obscure German
Workers’ Party, one of a number of right-wing extreme
nationalist parties in Munich. By the summer of 1921,
Hitler had assumed control of the party, which he renamed the National Socialist German Workers’ Party
(NSDAP), or Nazi Party for short. His idea was that the
party’s name would distinguish the Nazis from the socialist parties while gaining support from both workingclass and nationalist circles. Hitler worked assiduously
to develop the party into a mass political movement
with flags, badges, uniforms, its own newspaper, and its
own police force or party militia known as the SA, the
Sturmabteilung (Storm Troops). The SA was used to
defend the party in meeting halls and break up the
meetings of other parties. Hitler’s own oratorical skills
were largely responsible for attracting an increasing
number of followers. By 1923, the party had grown from
its early hundreds into a membership of 55,000, with
15,000 SA members.
Overconfident, Hitler staged an armed uprising
against the government in Munich in November 1923.
The so-called Beer Hall Putsch was quickly crushed, and
Hitler was sentenced to prison. During his brief stay in
jail, Hitler wrote Mein Kampf (My Struggle), an autobiographical account of his movement and its underlying
ideology. Extreme German nationalism, virulent antiSemitism, and vicious anticommunism are linked by a
social Darwinian theory of struggle that stresses the right
of superior nations to Lebensraum (living space) through
expansion and the right of ‘‘superior’’ individuals to
secure authoritarian leadership over the masses.
The Nazi Seizure of Power During his imprisonment,
Hitler also came to the realization that the Nazis would
have to acquire power by constitutional means, not by
overthrowing the Weimar Republic. This implied the
formation of a mass political party that would actively
compete for votes with the other political parties. After his
release from prison, Hitler reorganized the Nazi Party on
a regional basis and expanded it to all parts of Germany.
By 1929, the Nazis had a national party organization
whose membership grew from 27,000 in 1925 to 178,000
by the end of 1929. Especially noticeable was the youthfulness of the regional, district, and branch leaders of the
Nazi organization. Many were under thirty and were
fiercely committed to Hitler because he gave them the
kind of active politics they sought. Rather than democratic debate, they wanted brawls in beer halls, enthusiastic speeches, and comradeship in the building of a new
Germany. One new, young Nazi member expressed his
excitement about the party:
For me this was the start of a completely new life. There was
only one thing in the world for me and that was service in
the movement. All my thoughts were centred on the movement. I could talk only politics. I was no longer aware of
anything else. At the time I was a promising athlete; I was
very keen on sport, and it was going to be my career. But
I had to give this up too. My only interest was agitation and
propaganda.4
Such youthful enthusiasm gave the Nazi movement an
aura of a ‘‘young man’s movement’’ and a sense of dynamism that the other parties could not match.
By 1932, the Nazi Party had 800,000 members and
had become the largest party in the Reichstag. No doubt
Germany’s economic difficulties were a crucial factor in
the Nazi rise to power. Unemployment increased dramatically, from 4.4 million at the start of 1931 to 6 million
by the winter of 1932. The economic and psychological
impact of the Great Depression made extremist parties
more attractive. The Nazis were especially effective in
developing modern electioneering techniques. In their
campaigns, party members pitched their themes to the
needs and fears of different social groups. But even as they
were making blatant appeals to class interests, the Nazis
were denouncing conflicts of interest and maintaining
that they stood above classes and parties. Hitler, in particular, claimed to transcend all differences and promised
to create a new Germany free of class differences and
party infighting. His appeal to national pride, national
honor, and traditional militarism struck chords of emotion in his listeners.
Increasingly, the right-wing elites of Germany---the
industrial magnates, landed aristocrats, military establishment, and higher bureaucrats---began to see Hitler as
the man who had the mass support to establish an authoritarian regime that would save Germany and their
privileged positions from a Communist takeover. Under
pressure, President Hindenburg agreed to allow Hitler to
become chancellor (on January 30, 1933) and form a new
government.
Within two months, Hitler had laid the foundations
for the Nazis’ complete control of Germany. The day after
a fire broke out in the Reichstag building (February 27),
supposedly set by the Communists, Hitler convinced
President Hindenburg to issue a decree that gave the
government emergency powers. It suspended all basic
rights of citizens for the duration of the emergency, thus
enabling the Nazis to arrest and imprison anyone without
redress. The final step in Hitler’s ‘‘legal seizure’’ of power
came on March 23 when a two-thirds majority of the
Reichstag passed the Enabling Act, which empowered the
government to dispense with constitutional forms for
four years while it issued laws that would deal with the
country’s problems. In effect, Hitler became a dictator
appointed by parliament.
With their new source of power, the Nazis acted
quickly to enforce Gleichschaltung, the coordination of all
institutions under Nazi control. The civil service was
purged of Jews and democratic elements, concentration
camps were established for opponents of the new regime,
the autonomy of the federal states was eliminated, trade
unions were dissolved, and all political parties except the
Nazis were abolished. By the end of the summer of 1933,
within seven months of being appointed chancellor, Hitler
and the Nazis had established the foundations for a
totalitarian state. When Hindenburg died on August 2,
1934, the office of president was abolished, and Hitler
became the sole ruler of Germany. Public officials and
soldiers were all required to take a personal oath of loyalty
to Hitler as the ‘‘Fu¨hrer [leader] of the German Reich and
people.’’
The Nazi State, 1933–1939 Having demolished the
parliamentary republic, Hitler now felt that the real task
was at hand: to develop the ‘‘total state.’’ Hitler’s aims had
not been simply power for power’s sake; he had larger
ideological goals. The development of an ‘‘Aryan’’ racial
state that would dominate Europe and possibly the world
for generations to come required a movement in which
the German people would be actively involved, not passively cowed by force. Hitler stated:
We must develop organizations in which an individual’s
entire life can take place. Then every activity and every need
of every individual will be regulated by the collectivity represented by the party. There is no longer any arbitrary will,
there are no longer any free realms in which the individual
belongs to himself. . . . The time of personal happiness is
over.
5
The Nazis pursued the creation of this total state in a
variety of ways. Mass demonstrations and spectacles were
employed to integrate the German nation into a collective
fellowship and to mobilize it as an instrument for Hitler’s
policies (see the box above). These mass demonstrations,
especially the Nuremberg party rallies that were held
every September, combined the symbolism of a religious
service with the merriment of a popular amusement.
They had great appeal and usually evoked mass enthusiasm and excitement.
Some features of Hitler’s total state seem contradictory. One usually thinks of Nazi Germany as having an
all-powerful government that maintained absolute control and order. In truth, Nazi Germany was the scene of
almost constant personal and institutional conflict, which
resulted in administrative chaos. Incessant struggle characterized relationships within the party, within the state,
and between party and state. By fostering rivalry within
the party and between party and state, Hitler became the
ultimate decision maker.
Hitler and the Nazis also established control in the
economic sphere. Although the regime pursued the use of
public works projects and ‘‘pump-priming’’ grants to private construction firms to foster employment and end the
depression, there is little doubt that rearmament was a far
more important contributor to solving the unemployment
problem. Unemployment dropped to 2.6 million in 1934
and less than half a million in 1937. The regime claimed
full credit for solving Germany’s economic woes, an important factor that led many Germans to accept the new
regime, despite its excesses.
For those who needed coercion, the Nazi total state
had its instruments of terror and repression. Especially
important was the Schutzstaffel, or SS. Originally created
as Hitler’s personal bodyguard, the SS, under the direction
of Heinrich Himmler (1900--1945), came to control all of
the regular and secret police forces. Himmler and the SS
functioned on the basis of two principles: terror and
ideology. Terror included repression and murder: secret
police, criminal police, concentration camps, and later
execution squads and death camps for the extermination
of the Jews. For Himmler, the primary goal of the SS was
to ensure the dominance of the Aryan ‘‘master race.’’
Other institutions, such as the Catholic and Protestant churches, primary and secondary schools, and universities, were also brought under the control of the Nazi
total state. Nazi professional organizations and leagues
were formed for civil servants, teachers, women, farmers,
doctors, and lawyers. Because the early indoctrination of
youth would lay the foundation for a strong totalitarian
state for the future, youth organizations, the Hitler Jugend
(Hitler Youth) and its female counterpart, the Bund
Deutscher Ma¨del (League of German Girls), were given
special attention. The oath required of Hitler Youth
members demonstrates the degree of dedication expected
of youth in the Nazi state: ‘‘In the presence of this blood
banner, which represents our Fu¨hrer, I swear to devote all
my energies and my strength to the savior of our country,
Adolf Hitler. I am willing and ready to give up my life for
him, so help me God.’’
Women played a crucial role in the Aryan racial state
as bearers of the children who would bring about the
triumph of the Aryan race. To the Nazis, the differences
between men and women
were quite natural. Men were
warriors and political leaders;
women were destined to be
wives and mothers. Motherhood was also exalted in
an annual ceremony on August 12, Hitler’s mother’s
birthday, when Hitler awarded
the German Mother’s Cross
to a select group of German
mothers. Those with four children received a bronze cross,
those with six a silver cross,
and those with eight or more a
gold cross.
Nazi ideas determined
employment opportunities for
women. The Nazis hoped to
drive women out of heavy
industry or other jobs that
might hinder women from
bearing healthy children, as
well as certain professions,
including university teaching,
law, and medicine, which were
considered inappropriate for women, especially married
women. The Nazis encouraged women to pursue professional occupations that had direct practical application, such as social work and nursing. In addition to
restrictive legislation against females, the Nazi regime
pushed its campaign against working women with such
poster slogans as ‘‘Get hold of pots and pans and broom
and sooner you will find a groom!’’
The Nazi total state was intended to be an Aryan
racial state. From its beginning, the Nazi Party embraced
Hitler’s strong anti-Semitic beliefs. Once in power, the
Nazis translated these ideas into anti-Semitic policies. In
September 1935, the Nazis announced new racial laws at
the annual party rally in Nuremberg. These ‘‘Nuremberg
laws’’ excluded German Jews from German citizenship,
forbade marriages and extramarital relations between
Jews and German citizens, and essentially separated Jews
from the Germans politically, socially, and legally. They
were a codification of Hitler’s belief in the superiority of
the ‘‘pure Aryan race.’’
A considerably more violent phase of anti-Jewish activity took place in 1938 and 1939; it was initiated on
November 9--10, 1938, the infamous Kristallnacht, or
Night of Shattered Glass. The assassination of a lowranking secretary in the German embassy in Paris by a
Polish Jew became the excuse for a Nazi-led destructive
rampage against the Jews in Germany in which synagogues
were burned, seven thousand Jewish businesses were destroyed, and at least one hundred Jews were killed.
Moreover, thirty thousand Jewish males were rounded up
and sent to concentration camps. Further drastic steps
followed: Jews were barred from all public buildings and
prohibited from owning, managing, or working in any
retail store. Finally, under the direction of the SS, Jews
were encouraged to ‘‘emigrate from Germany.’’ After the
outbreak of World War II, the policy of emigration was
replaced by a more gruesome one.
The Soviet Union
Another kind of totalitarianism took shape in the Soviet
Union. The civil war in Russia had taken an enormous
toll of life. Drought, which caused a great famine between
1920 and 1922, claimed as many as five million lives.
Industrial collapse paralleled the agricultural disaster. By
1921, industrial output was only 20 percent of its 1913
level. Russia was exhausted. As Leon Trotsky said, ‘‘The
collapse of the productive forces surpassed anything of
the kind that history had ever seen. The country, and the
government with it, were at the very edge of the abyss.’’6
Lenin’s Policies In March 1921, Lenin pulled Russia
back from the abyss by establishing his New Economic
Policy (NEP), a modified version of the old capitalist
system. Peasants were now allowed to sell their produce
openly, and retail stores and small industries that employed fewer than twenty employees could now operate
under private ownership; heavy industry, banking, and
mines remained in the hands of the government. In 1922,
Lenin and the Communists merged Russia with several
smaller adjacent states to form the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, known by its initials as the USSR and
commonly called the Soviet Union. Already by that year, a
revived market and a good harvest had brought the
famine to an end; Soviet agriculture climbed to 75 percent of its prewar level. Industry, especially state-owned
heavy industry, fared less well and continued to stagnate.
Overall, the NEP had saved the Soviet Union from
complete economic disaster even though Lenin and other
leading Communists intended it to be only a temporary,
tactical retreat from the goals of communism.
In the meantime, Lenin and the Communists were
strengthening their one-party authoritarian state. The
number of bureaucrats increased dramatically and soon
constituted a new elite with the best jobs, food, and
dwellings. Even Lenin pronounced warnings about the
widening power of the bureaucracy that he had helped
create.
The Struggle for Power Lenin’s death in 1924 provoked
a struggle for power among the seven members of the
Politburo, the institution that had become the leading organ of the party. The Politburo was severely divided over
the future direction of the Soviet Union. The Left, led by
Leon Trotsky, wanted to end the NEP and launch the
Soviet Union on the path of rapid industrialization. This
group also believed that survival of the revolutionary vision
depended on spreading communism abroad. The Right
rejected the cause of world revolution and wanted instead
to concentrate on constructing a socialist state at home.
These ideological divisions were underscored by an
intense personal rivalry between Leon Trotsky and Joseph
Stalin. In 1924, Trotsky held the post of commissar of war
and was the leading spokesman for the Left in the Politburo. Joseph Stalin (1879--1953) was content to hold the
dull bureaucratic job of party general secretary. But Stalin
was a good organizer, and the other members of the
Politburo soon found that the position of party secretary
was really the most important in the party hierarchy.
Stalin used his post as party general secretary to gain
control of the Communist Party. Trotsky was expelled
from the party in 1927. By 1929, Stalin had succeeded in
eliminating the old Bolsheviks of the revolutionary era
from the Politburo and establishing a dictatorship so
powerful that the Russian tsars of old would have been
envious.
The Stalin Era, 1929–1939 Stalin made a significant
shift in economic policy in 1928 when he launched his
first five-year plan. Its real goal was nothing less than the
transformation of the Soviet Union from an agricultural
country into an industrial state virtually overnight. Instead
of consumer goods, the first five-year plan emphasized
maximum production of capital goods and armaments
and succeeded in quadrupling the production of heavy
machinery and doubling oil production. Between 1928
and 1937, during the first two five-year plans, steel
production increased from 4 to 18 million tons per year
and hard coal output went from 36 to 128 million tons.
The social and political costs of industrialization were
enormous. While the industrial labor force increased by
millions between 1932 and 1940, total investment in
housing actually declined after 1929, with the result that
millions of workers and their families lived in pitiful
conditions. Real wages in industry also declined by 43
percent between 1928 and 1940, and strict laws limited
workers’ freedom of movement. To inspire and pacify the
workers, government propaganda stressed the need for
sacrifice to build the new socialist state.
Rapid industrialization was accompanied by an
equally rapid collectivization of agriculture. Stalin believed
that the capital needs for industrial growth could be
gained by creating agricultural surpluses through eliminating private farms and pushing people into collective
farms (see the box above). By eliminating private property, a Communist ideal would also be achieved.
By 1930, some 10 million peasant households had
been collectivized; by 1934, the Soviet Union’s 26 million
family farms had been reorganized into 250,000 collective
units. This was done at tremendous cost, since Stalin
did not hesitate to starve the peasants, especially in the
Ukraine, to gain their compliance with the policy of
collectivization. Stalin is himself supposed to have told
Winston Churchill during World War II that ten million
peasants died in the artificially created famines of 1932
and 1933. The only concession Stalin made to the peasants was to allow each farmworker to have one tiny,
privately owned garden plot.
Stalin’s program of rapid industrialization entailed
additional costs as well. To achieve his goals, Stalin
strengthened his control over the party. Bureaucrats who
resisted were sent to forced-labor camps in Siberia. Stalin’s
desire for sole control of decision making also led to purges
of the old Bolsheviks, army officers, diplomats, union officials, party members, intellectuals, and numerous ordinary citizens. Estimates are that between 1936 and 1938,
eight million Soviets were arrested; millions were sent to
Siberian labor camps, from which they never returned.
Troubled by a rapidly declining birthrate, Stalin also
reversed much of the permissive social legislation of the
early 1920s. Advocating complete equality of rights for
women, the Communists had made divorce and abortion
easy to obtain while also encouraging women to work
outside the home. After Stalin came to power, the family
was praised as a miniature collective in which parents
were responsible for inculcating values of duty, discipline,
and hard work. Abortion was outlawed, and divorced
fathers who did not support their children were fined
heavily. The regime now praised motherhood and urged
women to have large families as a patriotic duty. But by
this time, many Soviet women worked in factories and
spent many additional hours in line waiting to purchase
increasingly scarce consumer goods. There was no dramatic increase in the birthrate.
The Stalinist era did bring some improvements in
the everyday lives of Soviet citizens. Stalin began a
program for workers, peasants, and young Communists
to receive higher education, especially in engineering,
in order to create leaders for the new Communist society. There was also a tremendous growth in part-time
schools in which large numbers of adults took courses to
become literate and advance to technical school or college. Increasing numbers of people saw education as the
key to better jobs and upward mobility in Soviet society.
One woman of peasant background recounted, ‘‘In
Moscow I had a burning desire to study. Where or what
wasn’t important; I wanted to study.’’ For what purpose?
‘‘We had a saying at work: ‘Without that piece of paper
[the diploma] you are an insect; with it, a
human being.’ My lack of higher education
prevented me from getting decent wages.’’7
Authoritarian States
A number of other states in Europe were
not totalitarian but did have conservative
authoritarian governments. These states
adopted some of the trappings of totalitarian
states, especially wide police powers, but
their greatest concern was not the creation of
a mass movement aimed at the establishment
of a new kind of society but rather the defense of the existing social order. Consequently, the authoritarian states tended to
limit the participation of the masses and
were content with passive obedience rather
than active involvement in the goals of
the regime.
Eastern Europe Nowhere had the map
of Europe been more drastically altered
by World War I than in eastern Europe.
The new states
of Austria, Poland,
Czechoslovakia, and
the Kingdom of the
Serbs, Croats, and
Slovenes (Yugoslavia) adopted parliamentary systems,
while the preexisting kingdoms of
Romania and Bulgaria gained new
parliamentary constitutions in 1920.
Greece became a
republic in 1924.
Hungary’s government was parliamentary in form but was controlled by its
landed aristocrats. At the beginning of the 1920s, political
democracy seemed well established, but almost everywhere in eastern Europe, parliamentary governments
soon gave way to authoritarian regimes.
Several problems helped create this situation. Eastern
European states had little tradition of liberalism or parliamentary politics and no substantial middle class to
support them. Then, too, these states were primarily
agrarian. Much of the land was still dominated by large
landowners who feared the growth of peasant parties with
schemes for land redistribution. Ethnic conflicts also
threatened to tear these countries apart. Fearful of land
reform, agrarian upheaval, and ethnic conflict, powerful
landowners and the churches looked to authoritarian
governments to maintain the old system. In eastern Europe, only Czechoslovakia, with its substantial middle
class, liberal tradition, and strong industrial base, managed
to maintain political democracy.
Franco’s Spain Elsewhere on the Continent, the failure
of political democracy was particularly dramatic in Spain.
Led by General Francisco Franco (1892--1975), Spanish
military forces revolted against the democratic government in 1936 and launched a brutal and bloody civil war
that lasted three years. Foreign intervention complicated
the Spanish Civil War. Franco’s forces were aided by arms,
money, and men from the fascist regimes of Italy and
Germany while the government was assisted by forty
thousand foreign volunteers and trucks, planes, tanks,
and military advisers from the Soviet Union. After
Franco’s forces captured Madrid on March 28, 1939, the
Spanish Civil War finally came to an end. Franco soon
established a dictatorship that favored large landowners,
businessmen, and the Catholic clergy---yet another traditional, conservative, authoritarian regime.
The Expansion of Mass Culture
and Mass Leisure
Q Focus Question: What new dimensions in mass
culture and mass leisure emerged during the interwar
years, and what role did these activities play in the
totalitarian states?
The decade of the 1920s was known as the Roaring
Twenties for the exuberance of its popular culture.
Berlin, the capital of Germany, became the entertainment
center of Europe, with its theaters, cabarets, cinemas, and
jazz clubs. The decade was especially known for its dance
crazes. People danced in clubs and dance halls, at home,
and in the streets, doing the Charleston, the Bunny Hug,
and a variety of other dances. An American singer and
dancer, Josephine Baker (1906--1975), became especially
well known in Europe, appearing at European clubs featuring American ‘‘Negro’’ jazz music. One critic said, ‘‘She
dances for hours without the slightest trace of tiredness.’’
She became a symbol of the popular ‘‘flapper,’’ the unconventional and lively young woman of the 1920s.
So popular was jazz, a musical form that had originated with African American musicians in the United
States, that the 1920s also became known as the Jazz Age.
Admired for its improvisations and forceful rhythms, jazz
spread throughout the Western world as King Oliver, Bix
Beiderbecke, Jelly Roll Morton, and others wrote and
played some of the greatest jazz music of the time.
Radio and Movies
A series of technological inventions in the late nineteenth
century had prepared the way for a revolution in mass
communications. Especially important was Marconi’s
discovery of ‘‘wireless’’ radio waves. But it was not until
June 16, 1920, that a radio broadcast (of a concert by
soprano Nellie Melba from London) for a mass audience
was attempted. Permanent broadcasting facilities were
then constructed in the United States, Europe, and Japan
during 1921 and 1922, and mass production of radios
(receiving sets) also began. In 1926, when the British
Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) was made into a public
corporation, there were 2.2 million radios in Great
Britain. By the end of the 1930s, there were 9 million. The
technical foundation for motion pictures had already
been developed in the 1890s when short movies were
produced as novelties for music halls. Shortly before
World War I, full-length features, such as the Italian film
Quo Vadis and the American film Birth of a Nation, became available and made it apparent that cinema had
become a new form of mass entertainment.
The increased size of mass audiences and the ability
of radio and cinema to provide an immediate experience
added new dimensions to mass culture. Favorite film
actors and actresses became stars whose lives then became
subject to public adoration and scrutiny. Sensuous actresses such as Marlene Dietrich, whose appearance in the
early sound film The Blue Angel catapulted her to fame,
projected new images of women’s sexuality.
Of course, mass culture could also be used for
political purposes. Film, for example, had propaganda
potential, a possibility not lost on Joseph Goebbels
(1897--1945), the propaganda minister of Nazi Germany.
Believing that film constituted one of the ‘‘most modern
and scientific means of influencing the masses,’’ Goebbels
created a special film section in his Propaganda Ministry
and encouraged the production of both documentaries
and popular feature films that carried the Nazi message.
The Triumph of the Will, a prime example, was a documentary of the 1934 Nuremberg party rally that forcefully
conveyed the power of Nazism to viewers (see Film &
History: Triumph of the Will).
Mass Leisure
Mass leisure activities had developed at the turn of the
century, but new work patterns after World War I dramatically expanded the amount of free time available to
take advantage of them. By 1920, the eight-hour day had
become the norm for many office and factory workers in
northern and western Europe.
Professional sporting events for mass audiences became an important aspect of mass leisure. Attendance at
association football (soccer) games soared, and the inauguration of the World Cup contest in 1930 intensified
the nationalistic rivalries that came to surround mass
sporting events. Increased attendance also made the 1920s
and 1930s a great era of stadium building. The Germans
built a stadium in Berlin for the 1936 Olympics that
seated 140,000 people.
Travel opportunities also added new dimensions to
mass leisure activities. The military use of aircraft during
World War I helped improve planes and make civilian air
travel a reality. The first regular international mail service
began in 1919, and regular passenger service soon followed.
Although air travel remained the preserve of the wealthy or
the adventurous, trains, buses, and private cars made excursions to beaches or holiday resorts more popular and
possible for the less wealthy.
Mass leisure provided totalitarian regimes with new
ways to control their populations. The Nazi regime created
a program known as Kraft durch Freude (Strength
Through Joy) to coordinate the free time of the working
class by offering a variety of activities, including concerts,
operas, films, guided tours, and sporting events. Especially
popular were the inexpensive vacations, essentially modern package tours. These could be cruises to Scandinavia
or the Mediterranean or, more likely for workers, shorter
trips to various sites in Germany. Essentially, Kraft durch
Freude enabled the German government to supervise
recreational activities. In doing so, the state imposed new
rules and regulations on previously spontaneous activities,
thus breaking down old group solidarities and allowing
these groups to be guided by the goals of the state.
Cultural and Intellectual Trends
in the Interwar Years
Q Focus Question: What were the main cultural and
intellectual trends in the interwar years?
The artistic and intellectual innovations of the pre--World
War I period, which many Europeans found shocking,
had been the preserve primarily of a small group of avantgarde artists and intellectuals. In the 1920s and 1930s,
these adventurous approaches became more widespread.
What made the prewar avant-garde culture so much more
acceptable in the 1920s and the 1930s? Perhaps most
important was the impact of World War I.
Four years of devastating war left many Europeans
with a profound sense of despair and disillusionment. To
many people, the experiences of World War I seemed to
confirm the prewar avant-garde belief that human beings
were really violent and irrational animals who were incapable of creating a sane and rational world. The Great
Depression, as well as the growth of fascist movements
based on violence and the degradation of individual rights,
only added to the uncertainties generated by World War I.
Political and economic uncertainties were paralleled
by social insecurities. World War I had served to break
down many traditional middle-class attitudes, especially
toward sexuality. In the 1920s, women’s physical appearance changed dramatically. Short skirts, short hair,
the use of cosmetics once thought suitable only for
prostitutes, and the new practice of suntanning gave
women a radically different image. This change in physical appearance, which exposed more of a woman’s body
than ever before, was also accompanied by frank discussions of sexual matters. In 1926, the Dutch physician
Theodor van de Velde published Ideal Marriage: Its
Physiology and Technique, which described female and
male anatomy, discussed birth control techniques, and
glorified sexual pleasure in marriage. Translated into a
number of languages, it became an international bestseller. New ideas on sexuality and birth control were also
spread to the working classes by family planning clinics,
such as those of Margaret Sanger in the United States and
Marie Stopes in Britain.
Nightmares and New Visions: Art and Music
Uncertainty also pervaded the cultural and intellectual
achievements of the interwar years. Postwar artistic trends
were largely a working out of the implications of prewar
developments. Abstract painting, for example, became
ever more popular as many pioneering artists of the early
twentieth century matured between the two world wars.
In addition, prewar fascination with the absurd and the
unconscious contents of the mind seemed even more
appropriate after the nightmarish landscapes of World
War I battlefronts. This gave rise to both the Dada
movement and Surrealism, although it was German Expressionist artists who best captured directly the disturbingly destructive effects of World War I.
German Expressionists Although Expressionism as a
movement began before World War I, the war itself had a
devastating impact on a group of German Expressionist
artists who focused on the suffering and shattered lives
caused by the war. George Grosz (1893--1958), one of
these artists, expressed his anger in this way: ‘‘Of course,
there was a kind of mass enthusiasm at the start. . . . And
then after a few years when everything bogged down,
when we were defeated, when everything went to pieces,
all that remained, at least of me and most of my friends,
were disgust and horror.’’8 Another German artist who
gave visual expression to the horrors of World War I was
Otto Dix (1891--1959), who had also served in the war
and was well versed in its effects. In The War, he gave a
graphic presentation of the devastating effects of war.
Dadaism Dadaism attempted to enshrine the purposelessness of life. Tristan Tzara, a French poet born in
Romania and one of the founders of Dadaism, expressed
the Dadaist contempt for the Western tradition in a lecture in 1922: ‘‘The acts of life have no beginning or end.
Everything happens in a completely idiotic way. . . . Like
everything in life, Dada is useless.’’9 Revolted by the insanity of life, the Dadaists tried to give it expression by
creating anti-art. In the hands of Hannah Ho¨ch (1889--
1978), however, Dada became an instrument to comment
on women’s roles in the new mass culture.
Surrealism More important as an artistic movement
was Surrealism, which sought a reality beyond the material, sensible world and found it in the unconscious
through the portrayal of fantasies, dreams, or nightmares.
Employing logic to portray the illogical, the Surrealists
created disturbing and evocative images. The Spaniard
Salvador Dalı´ (1904--1989) became the high priest of
Surrealism and in his mature phase became a master of
representational Surrealism. In The Persistence of Memory,
Dalı´ pictured recognizable objects divorced from their
normal context. By placing these objects into unrecognizable relationships, Dalı´ created a disturbing world in
which the irrational had become tangible.
Functionalism in Architecture The move to functionalism in modern architecture also became more
widespread in the 1920s and 1930s. First conceived near
the end of the nineteenth century, functionalism meant
that buildings should be useful, fulfilling the purpose for
which they were constructed. Art and engineering were to
be unified, and all unnecessary ornamentation was to be
stripped away. Functionalism was based on the belief of
architects that art had a social function and could help
create a new civilization.
Especially important in the spread of functionalism
was the Bauhaus school, founded in 1919 at Weimar,
Germany, by the Berlin architect Walter Gropius. The
Bauhaus teaching staff consisted of architects, artists, and
designers who worked together to combine the study of
fine arts (painting and sculpture) with the applied arts
(printing, weaving, and furniture making).
Art in Nazi Germany The postwar acceptance of modern art forms was by no means universal. Many traditionalists denounced what they considered degeneracy
and decadence in the arts. This was especially evident in
the totalitarian state of Nazi Germany. In the 1920s,
Weimar Germany was one of the chief European centers
for modern arts and sciences. Hitler and the Nazis rejected modern art as ‘‘degenerate’’ or ‘‘Jewish’’ art. In
1937, Hitler said, ‘‘The people regarded this art as the
outcome of an impudent and unashamed arrogance or of
a simply shocking lack of skill; . . . these achievements
which might have been produced by untalented children
of from eight to ten years old could never be valued as an
expression of our own times or of the German future.’’10
Hitler and the Nazis believed that they had laid the
foundation for a new and genuine German art, which
would glorify the strong, the healthy, and the heroic---
mirroring the supposed attributes of the Aryan race.
A New Style in Music At the beginning of the twentieth
century, a revolution in music parallel to the revolution in
art had begun with the work of Igor Stravinsky. But
Stravinksy still wrote music in a definite key. The
Viennese composer Arnold Scho¨nberg (1874--1951)
began to experiment with a radically new style by creating
musical pieces devoid of tonality, a system that he called
atonal music.
The Search for the Unconscious in Literature
The interest in the unconscious, heightened by the impact
of World War I and evident in Surrealism, was also apparent in the development of new literary techniques
that emerged in the 1920s. One of its most visible manifestations was a ‘‘stream of consciousness’’ technique in
which the writer presented an interior monologue or a
report of the innermost thoughts of each character. The
most famous example of this genre was written by the
Irish exile James Joyce (1882--1941). His Ulysses, published in 1922, told the story of one day in the life of
ordinary people in Dublin by following the flow of their
inner thoughts.
The German writer Hermann Hesse (1877--1962)
dealt with the unconscious in a different way. His novels
reflected the influence of new psychological theories and
Eastern religions and focused on, among other things,
the spiritual loneliness of modern human beings in a
mechanized urban society. Demian was a psychoanalytical study of incest, and Steppenwolf mirrored the
psychological confusion of modern existence. Hesse’s
novels had a large impact on German youth in the 1920s
(see the box above). He won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1946.
The Unconscious in Psychology
The growing concern with the unconscious also led to
greater popular interest in psychology. The full impact
of Sigmund Freud’s thought was not felt until after
World War I. The 1920s witnessed a worldwide acceptance of his ideas. Freudian terms such as unconscious,
repression, id, and ego entered the popular vocabulary.
Popularization of Freud’s ideas led to the widespread
misconception that an uninhibited sex life was necessary
for mental health. Psychoanalysis developed into a major
profession, especially in the United States, but Freud’s
ideas did not go unchallenged, even by his own pupils.
One of the most prominent challenges came from
Carl Jung.
A disciple of Freud, Carl Jung (1875--1961) came to
believe that Freud’s theories were too narrow and based on
Freud’s own personal biases. Jung’s study of dreams---his
own and others---led him to diverge sharply from Freud.
Whereas for Freud the unconscious was the seat of repressed desires or appetites, for Jung it was an opening to
deep spiritual needs and ever-greater vistas for humans.
Jung viewed the unconscious as twofold: a ‘‘personal
unconscious’’ and a deeper ‘‘collective unconscious.’’ The
collective unconscious was the repository of memories
that all human beings share and consisted of archetypes,
mental forms or images that appear in dreams. The archetypes are common to all people and have a special
energy that gives rise to myths, religions, and philosophies. To Jung, the mind was only in part personal or
individual because the origin of the archetypes was buried
so far in the past that they seemed to have no human
source. Their function was to bring the original mind of
humans into a new, higher state of consciousness.
The ‘‘Heroic Age of Physics’’
The prewar revolution in physics initiated by Max
Planck and Albert Einstein continued in the interwar
period. In fact, Ernest Rutherford (1871--1937), one of
the physicists responsible for demonstrating that the
atom could be split, dubbed the 1920s the ‘‘heroic age of
physics.’’
The new picture of the universe that was unfolding
continued to undermine the old scientific certainties
of classical physics. Classical physics had rested on the
fundamental belief that all phenomena could be predicted
if they could be completely understood; thus the weather
could be predicted if we knew everything about the
wind, sun, and water. In 1927, the German physicist
Werner Heisenberg (1901--1976) upset this belief when he
posited the uncertainty principle. In essence, Heisenberg
suggested that no one could determine the path of an
electron because the very act of observing the electron by
illuminating it with light affected the electron’s location.
The uncertainty principle was more than an explanation
for the path of an electron, however; it was a new
worldview. Heisenberg shattered confidence in predictability and dared to propose that uncertainty was at the
root of all the physical laws.
CONCLUSION
The devastation wrought by World War I dashed the liberal
optimism of the prewar era. Yet many people in the 1920s still
hoped that the progress of Western civilization, so seemingly
evident before 1914, could somehow be restored. These hopes
proved largely unfounded as plans for economic reconstruction
gave way to inflation and to an even more devastating economic
depression at the end of the 1920s. Likewise, confidence in
political democracy was soon shattered by the rise of authoritarian
governments that not only restricted individual freedoms and the
rule of law but, in the cases of Italy, Germany, and the Soviet
Union, sought even greater control over the lives of their
subjects in order to manipulate and guide them to achieve the
goals of their totalitarian regimes. For many people, despite the
loss of personal freedom, these mass movements at least offered
some sense of security in a world that seemed fraught with
uncertainties.
These uncertainties grew even greater as Europeans, after
a brief twenty-year interlude, again plunged into war, this time
on a scale even more horrendous than that of World War I.
The twentieth-century crisis begun in 1914 seemed only to be
worsening in 1939, and Western civilization itself seemed to be
in great danger.
