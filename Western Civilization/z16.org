related?

The trial of Galileo

IN ADDITION TO POLITICAL, economic, and social crises,
the seventeenth century witnessed an intellectual one. The Scientific
Revolution questioned and ultimately challenged conceptions and
beliefs about the nature of the external world and reality that had
crystallized into a rather strict orthodoxy by the Later Middle Ages.
Derived from the works of ancient Greeks and Romans and
grounded in Christian thought, the medieval worldview had become
almost overpowering. But the breakdown of Christian unity during
the Reformation and the subsequent religious wars had created an
environment in which Europeans became more comfortable with
challenging both the ecclesiastical and political powers that be.
Should it surprise us that a challenge to intellectual authority
soon followed?

The Scientific Revolution taught Europeans to view the universe and their place in it in a new way. The shift from an earthcentered to a sun-centered cosmos had an emotional as well as intellectual effect on those who understood it. Thus the Scientific Revolution, popularized in the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, stands
as the major force in the transition to the largely secular, rational,
and materialistic perspective that has defined the modern Western
mentality in modern times.

The transition to a new worldview was far from easy, however.
In the seventeenth century, the Italian scientist Galileo Galilei, an
outspoken advocate of the new worldview, found his ideas strongly
opposed by the authorities of the Roman Catholic Church. Galileo’s
position was clear: ‘‘I hold the sun to be situated motionless in the
center of the revolution of the celestial bodies, while the earth rotates
on its axis and revolves about the sun.’’ Moreover, ‘‘nothing physical
that sense-experience sets before our eyes . . . ought to be called in
question (much less condemned) upon the testimony of biblical
passages.’’ But the church had a different view, and in 1633, Galileo,
now sixty-eight and in ill health, was called before the dreaded
Inquisition in Rome. He was kept waiting for two months before he
was tried and found guilty of heresy and disobedience. Completely
shattered by the experience, he denounced his errors: ‘‘With a sincere
heart and unfeigned faith I curse and detest the said errors and heresies contrary to the Holy Church.’’ Legend holds that when he left
the trial rooms, Galileo muttered to himself: ‘‘And yet it does move!’’
In any case, Galileo had been silenced, but his writings remained,
and they began to circulate through Europe. The actions of the
Inquisition had failed to stop the spread of the new ideas of the
Scientific Revolution.

In one sense, the Scientific Revolution was not a revolution. It
was not characterized by the explosive change and rapid overthrow
of traditional authority that we normally associate with the word
revolution. The Scientific Revolution did overturn centuries of authority, but only in a gradual and piecemeal fashion. Nevertheless,
its results were truly revolutionary. The Scientific Revolution was a
key factor in setting Western civilization on its modern secular and
material path.

Background to the
Scientific Revolution
Q Focus Question: What developments during the
Middle Ages and the Renaissance contributed to the
Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century?
To say that the Scientific Revolution brought about a
dissolution of the medieval worldview is not to say that
the Middle Ages was a period of scientific ignorance.
Many educated Europeans took an intense interest in the
world around them, regarding it as ‘‘God’s handiwork’’
and therefore an appropriate subject for study. Late medieval scholastic philosophers had advanced mathematical
and physical thinking in many ways, but the subjection of
these thinkers to a strict theological framework and their
unquestioning reliance on a few ancient authorities, especially Aristotle and Galen, limited where they could go.
Many ’’natural philosophers,’’ as medieval scientists were
known, preferred refined logical analysis to systematic
observations of the natural world. A number of changes
and advances in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries may
have played a major role in helping the ‘‘natural philosophers’’ abandon their old views and develop new ones.
Ancient Authors and Renaissance Artists
The Renaissance humanists mastered both Greek and
Latin and brought new attention to ancient works by
thinkers such as Ptolemy, Archimedes, and Plato. These
writings made it clear that even the unquestioned authorities of the Middle Ages, Aristotle and Galen, had
been contradicted by other thinkers. The desire to discover which school of thought was correct stimulated
new scientific work that sometimes led to a complete
rejection of the Classical authorities.
Renaissance artists have also been credited with having an impact on scientific study. Their desire to imitate
nature led them to rely on a close observation of nature.
Their accurate renderings of rocks, plants, animals, and
human anatomy established new standards for the study
of natural phenomena. At the same time, the ‘‘scientific’’
study of the problems of perspective and correct anatomical proportions led to new insights. ‘‘No painter,’’ one
Renaissance artist declared, ‘‘can paint well without a
thorough knowledge of geometry.’’1
Technological Innovations and Mathematics
Technical problems, such as calculating the tonnage of
ships accurately, also served to stimulate scientific activity
because they required careful observation and accurate
measurements. Then, too, the invention of new instruments and machines, such as the telescope and microscope, often made new scientific discoveries possible. The
printing press played a crucial role in spreading innovative ideas quickly and accurately.
Mathematics, so fundamental to the scientific achievements of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, was
promoted in the Renaissance by the rediscovery of the
works of ancient mathematicians and the influence of
Plato, who had emphasized the importance of mathematics in explaining the universe. Applauded as the key to
navigation, military science, and geography, mathematics
was also regarded as the key to understanding the nature
of things. According to Leonardo da Vinci, since God
eternally geometrizes, nature is inherently mathematical:
‘‘Proportion is not only found in numbers and measurements but also in sounds, weights, times, positions, and in
whatsoever power there may be.’’2 Copernicus, Kepler,
Galileo, and Newton were all great mathematicians who
believed that the secrets of nature were written in the
language of mathematics.

Renaissance Magic
Another factor in the Scientific Revolution may have
been magic. Renaissance magic was the preserve of the
intellectual elite of Europe. By the end of the sixteenth
century, Hermetic magic (see Chapter 12) had become
fused with alchemical thought into a single intellectual
framework. This tradition believed that the world was a
living embodiment of divinity. Humans, who it was
believed also had that spark of divinity within, could
use magic, especially mathematical magic, to understand and dominate the world of nature or employ
the powers of nature for beneficial purposes. Was it
Hermeticism, then, that inaugurated the shift in consciousness that made the Scientific Revolution possible,
since the desire to control and dominate the natural
world was a crucial motivating force in the Scientific
Revolution? Scholars debate the issue, but histories of
the Scientific Revolution frequently overlook the fact
that the great names we associate with the revolution in
cosmology---Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton---
all had a serious interest in Hermetic ideas and the fields
of astrology and alchemy. The mention of these names
also reminds us of one final consideration in the origins
of the Scientific Revolution: it resulted largely from the
work of a handful of great intellectuals.
Toward a New Heaven:
A Revolution in Astronomy
Q Focus Question: What did Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo,
and Newton contribute to a new vision of the
universe, and how did it differ from the Ptolemaic
conception of the universe?
The cosmological views of the Later Middle Ages had been
built on a synthesis of the ideas of Aristotle, Ptolemy (the
greatest astronomer of antiquity, who lived in the second
century A.D.), and Christian theology. In the resulting
Ptolemaic or geocentric (earth-centered) conception, the
universe was seen as a series of concentric spheres with a
fixed or motionless earth at its center. Composed of material substance, the earth was imperfect and constantly
changing. The spheres that surrounded the earth were
made of a crystalline, transparent substance and moved in
circular orbits around the earth. Circular movement,
according to Aristotle, was the most ‘‘perfect’’ kind of
motion and hence appropriate for the ‘‘perfect’’ heavenly
bodies thought to consist of a nonmaterial, incorruptible
‘‘quintessence.’’ These heavenly bodies, pure orbs of light,
were embedded in the moving, concentric spheres, which
in 1500 numbered ten. Working outward from the earth,
eight spheres contained the moon, Mercury, Venus, the
sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the fixed stars. The ninth
sphere imparted to the eighth sphere of the fixed stars its
motion, while the tenth sphere was frequently described as
the prime mover that moved itself and imparted motion
to the other spheres. Beyond the tenth sphere was the
Empyrean Heaven---the location of God and all the saved
souls. This Christianized Ptolemaic universe, then, was
finite. It had a fixed outer boundary in harmony with
Christian thought and expectations. God and the saved
souls were at one end of the universe, and humans at the
center. Humans had been given power over the earth, but
their real purpose was to achieve salvation.
Copernicus
Shortly before his death, Nicolaus Copernicus (1473--1543),
who had studied mathematics and astronomy first at
Krakow in his native Poland and later at the Italian universities of Bologna and Padua, published his famous book
On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres. Copernicus was
not an accomplished observational astronomer and relied
for his data on the records of his predecessors. But he was a
mathematician who felt that Ptolemy’s geocentric system
was too complicated and failed to accord with the observed
motions of the heavenly bodies (see the box on p. 344).
Copernicus hoped that his heliocentric (sun-centered)
conception would offer a more accurate explanation.
Copernicus argued that the universe consisted of
eight spheres with the sun motionless at the center and
the sphere of the fixed stars at rest in the eighth sphere.
The planets revolved around the sun in the order of
Mercury, Venus, the earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. The
moon, however, revolved around the earth. Moreover,
according to Copernicus, what appeared to be the
movement of the sun and the fixed stars around the earth
was really explained by the daily rotation of the earth on
its axis and the journey of the earth around the sun
each year.
The heliocentric theory had little immediate impact;
most people were not yet ready to accept Copernicus’
thinking. But doubts about the Ptolemaic system were
growing. The next step in destroying the geocentric conception and supporting the Copernican system was taken
by the German scientist Johannes Kepler.
Kepler
The work of Johannes Kepler (1571--1630) illustrates the
narrow line that often separated magic and science in the
early Scientific Revolution. An avid astrologer, Kepler
possessed a keen interest in Hermetic thought and mathematical magic. In a book written in 1596, he elaborated
on his theory that the universe was constructed on the
basis of geometric figures, such as the pyramid and the
cube. Believing that the harmony of the human soul
(a divine attribute) was mirrored in the numerical relationships existing between the planets, he focused much of
his attention on discovering the ‘‘music of the spheres.’’
Kepler was also a brilliant mathematician and astronomer
who took a post as imperial mathematician to Emperor
Rudolf II. Using the detailed astronomical data of his
predecessor, Kepler derived laws of planetary motion that
confirmed the heliocentric theory. In his first law, he
contradicted Copernicus by showing that the orbits of the
planets around the sun were not circular but elliptical, with
the sun at one focus of the ellipse rather than at the center.
Kepler’s work effectively eliminated the idea of
uniform circular motion as well as the idea of crystalline
spheres revolving in circular orbits. The basic structure
of the traditional Ptolemaic system had been destroyed,
and people had been freed to think in new ways of the
paths of planets revolving around the sun. By the end of
Kepler’s life, the Ptolemaic system was rapidly losing
ground to the new ideas. Important questions remained
unanswered, however. What were the planets made of?
And how does one explain motion in the universe? It
was an Italian scientist who achieved the next important
breakthrough to a new cosmology by answering the first
question.
Galileo
Galileo Galilei (1564--1642) taught mathematics, first at
Pisa and later at Padua, one of the most prestigious
universities in Europe. Galileo was the first European
to make systematic observations of the heavens by
means of a telescope, thereby inaugurating a new age
in astronomy. He had heard of a Flemish lens grinder
who had created a ‘‘spyglass’’ that magnified objects seen
at a distance and soon constructed his own. Instead of
peering at terrestrial objects, Galileo turned his telescope
to the skies and made a remarkable series of discoveries:
mountains on the moon, four moons revolving around
Jupiter, the phases of Venus, and sunspots. Galileo’s
observations seemed to destroy yet another aspect of the
traditional cosmology in that the universe seemed to be
composed of a material substance similar to that of
earth rather than an ethereal or perfect and unchanging
substance.
Galileo’s revelations, published in The Starry Messenger in 1610, stunned his contemporaries and probably did more to make Europeans aware of the new
picture of the universe than the mathematical theories
of Copernicus and Kepler. But his newfound acclaim
brought Galileo the increasing scrutiny of the Catholic
church. The Roman Inquisition (or Holy Office) of the
church condemned Copernicanism and ordered Galileo
to abandon the Copernican thesis. The Inquisition’s
report insisted that ‘‘the doctrine that the sun was the
center of the world and immovable was false and absurd, formally heretical and contrary to Scripture,
whereas the doctrine that the earth was not the center of
the world but moved, and has further a daily motion,
was philosophically false and absurd and theologically
at least erroneous.’’3 Thus the church attacked the
Copernican system because it threatened not only Scripture but also the entire prevailing conception of the
universe (see the box on p. 346). The heavens were no
longer a spiritual world but a world of matter. Humans
were no longer at the center, and God was no longer in a
specific place. All this the church found intolerable.
In 1633, Galileo was found guilty of teaching the condemned Copernican system and was forced to recant
his ‘‘errors.’’
The condemnation of Galileo by the Inquisition,
coming at a time of economic decline, seriously undermined further scientific work in Italy, which had been at
the forefront of scientific innovation. Leadership in science now passed to the northern countries, especially
England, France, and the Dutch Netherlands. By the
1630s and 1640s, no reasonable astronomer could overlook that Galileo’s discoveries combined with Kepler’s
mathematical laws had made nonsense of the PtolemaicAristotelian world system and clearly established the
reasonableness of the Copernican model. Nevertheless,
the problem of explaining motion in the universe and
tying together the ideas of Copernicus, Galileo, and
Kepler had not yet been solved. This would be the work of
an Englishman who has long been considered the greatest
genius of the Scientific Revolution.
Newton
Born in the English village of Woolsthorpe, Isaac Newton
(1642--1727) showed little promise until he attended
Cambridge University. In 1669, he accepted a chair in
mathematics at the university. During an intense period
of creativity from 1684 to 1686, he wrote his major work,
Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, known
simply as the Principia, from the first word of its Latin
title. In this work, Newton spelled out the mathematical
proofs demonstrating his universal law of gravitation.
Newton’s work was the culmination of the theories of
Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo. While each had undermined some part of the Ptolemaic-Aristotelian cosmology, no one until Newton had pieced together a coherent
synthesis for a new cosmology.
In the first book of the Principia, Newton defined the
basic concepts of mechanics by elaborating the three laws
of motion: every object continues in a state of rest or
uniform motion in a straight line unless deflected by a
force; the rate of change of motion of an object is proportional to the force acting on it; and to every action there
is always an equal and opposite reaction. In book three,
Newton applied his theories of mechanics to the problems
of astronomy by demonstrating that these three laws of
motion govern the planetary bodies as well as terrestrial
objects. Integral to his whole argument was the universal
law of gravitation to explain why the planetary bodies did
not go off in straight lines but continued in elliptical orbits
about the sun. In mathematical terms, Newton explained
that every object in the universe was attracted to every
other object with a force (gravity) that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distances between them.
The implications of Newton’s universal law of gravitation were enormous, even if it took another century
before they were widely recognized. Newton had demonstrated that one universal law, mathematically proved,
could explain all motion in the universe. At the same
time, the Newtonian synthesis created a new cosmology
in which the world was seen largely in mechanistic terms.
The universe was one huge, regulated, and uniform machine that operated according to natural laws in absolute
time, space, and motion. Although Newton believed that
God was ‘‘everywhere present’’ and acted as the force that
moved all bodies on the basis of the laws he had discovered, later generations dropped his spiritual assumptions. Newton’s world-machine, conceived as operating
absolutely in space, time, and motion, dominated the
modern worldview until the twentieth century, when the
Einsteinian revolution based on a concept of relativity
superseded the Newtonian mechanistic concept.
Newton’s ideas were soon accepted in England but
were resisted on the Continent, and it took much of the
eighteenth century before they were generally accepted
everywhere in Europe. They were also reinforced by
developments in other fields, especially medicine.
Advances in Medicine
and Chemistry
Q Focus Question: What did Vesalius, Harvey, Boyle,
and Lavoisier contribute to a scientific view of
medicine and chemistry?
Although the Scientific Revolution of the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries is associated primarily with the
dramatic changes in astronomy and mechanics that precipitated a new perception of the universe, a third field
that had been dominated by Greek thought in the Later
Middle Ages, medicine, also experienced a transformation. Late medieval medicine was dominated by the
teachings of the Greek physician Galen, who had lived in
the second century A.D.
Galen’s influence on the medieval medical world was
pervasive in anatomy, physiology, and disease. Galen had
relied on animal, rather than human, dissection to arrive
at a picture of human anatomy that was quite inaccurate
in many instances. Even when Europeans began to practice
human dissection in the Later Middle Ages, instruction in
anatomy still relied on Galen. While a professor read a text
of Galen, an assistant dissected a cadaver for illustrative
purposes. Physiology, or the functioning of the body, was
also dominated by Galenic hypotheses, including the belief
that there were two separate blood systems, one controlling muscular activities and containing bright red blood
moving upward and downward through the arteries, the
other governing the digestive functions and containing
dark red blood that ebbed and flowed in the veins.
Vesalius
Two major figures are associated with the changes in
medicine in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries:
Andreas Vesalius and William Harvey. The new anatomy
of the sixteenth century was the work of the Belgian
Andreas Vesalius (1514--1564). After receiving a doctorate in medicine at the University of Padua in 1536,
Vesalius accepted a position there as professor of surgery. In 1543, he published his masterpiece, On the
Fabric of the Human Body. This book was based on his
Paduan lectures, in which he deviated from traditional
practice by personally dissecting a body to illustrate
what he was discussing. Vesalius’ anatomical treatise
presented a careful examination of the individual organs
and general structure of the human body. The book
would not have been feasible without the artistic advances of the Renaissance and the technical developments in the art of printing. Together, these advances
made possible the creation of illustrations superior to
any hitherto produced.
Vesalius’ hands-on approach to teaching anatomy
enabled him to overthrow some of Galen’s most glaring
errors. He did not hesitate, for example, to correct Galen’s
assertion that the great blood vessels originated from the
liver since his own observations made it clear that they
came from the heart. Nevertheless, Vesalius still clung to a
number of Galen’s erroneous assertions, including the
Greek physician’s ideas on the ebb and flow of two kinds
of blood in the veins and arteries. It was not until William
Harvey’s work on the circulation of the blood that this
Galenic misperception was corrected.
Harvey
The Englishman William Harvey (1578--1657) attended
Cambridge University and later Padua, where he earned
a doctorate in medicine in 1602. His reputation rests on
his book On the Motion of the Heart and Blood, published in 1628. Although questions had been raised in
the sixteenth century about Galen’s physiological principles, no major challenge to his system had emerged.
Harvey’s work, based on meticulous observations and
experiments, led him to reject the ancient Greek’s contentions. Harvey demonstrated that the heart was the
beginning point of the circulation of blood in the body,
that the same blood flows in both veins and arteries,
and that the blood makes a complete circuit as it passes
through the body. Although Harvey’s work dealt a severe
blow to Galen’s theories, his ideas did not begin to
achieve general recognition until the 1660s, when the
capillaries, which explained how the blood passed from
the arteries to the veins, were discovered. Harvey’s theory of the circulation of the blood laid the foundation
for modern physiology.
Chemistry
In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, a science of
chemistry emerged. Robert Boyle (1627--1691) was one of
the first scientists to conduct controlled experiments. His
pioneering work on the properties of gases led to Boyle’s
law, which states that the volume of a gas varies with the
pressure exerted on it. Boyle also rejected the medieval
belief that all matter consisted of the same components in
favor of the view that matter is composed of atoms, which
he called ‘‘little particles of all shapes and sizes’’ and which
in various combinations formed the chemical elements.
In the eighteenth century, the Frenchman Antoine Lavoisier
(1743--1794) invented a system for naming the chemical
elements, much of which is still used today. He is regarded by many historians as the founder of modern
chemistry.
Women in the Origins
of Modern Science
Q Focus Question: What role did women play in the
Scientific Revolution?
During the Middle Ages, except for members of religious
orders, women who sought a life of learning were severely
hampered by the traditional attitude that a woman’s
proper role was as a daughter, wife, and mother. But in
the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, new
opportunities for elite women emerged as enthusiasm for
the new secular learning called humanism encouraged
Europe’s privileged and learned men to encourage women
to read and study Classical and Christian texts. The ideal
of a humanist education for some of the daughters of
Europe’s elite persisted into the seventeenth century.
Margaret Cavendish
Much as they were drawn to humanism, women were also
attracted to the Scientific Revolution. Unlike females
educated formally in humanist schools, women interested
in science had to obtain a largely informal education.
European nobles had the leisure and resources that gave
them easy access to the world of learning. This door was
also open to noblewomen, who could participate in the
informal scientific networks of their fathers and brothers.
One of the most prominent female scientists of the
seventeenth century, Margaret Cavendish (1623--1673)
came from an aristocratic background. Cavendish was
not a popularizer of science for women but a participant in the crucial scientific debates of her time. Despite
her achievement, however, she was excluded from
membership in the Royal Society (see ‘‘The Spread of
Scientific Knowledge’’ later in this chapter), although
she was once allowed to attend a meeting. She wrote
a number of works on scientific matters, including
Observations upon Experimental Philosophy and Grounds
of Natural Philosophy. In these works, she did not hesitate
to attack what she considered the defects of the rationalist
and empiricist approaches to scientific knowledge and
was especially critical of the growing belief that humans
through science were the masters of nature: ‘‘We have no
power at all over natural causes and effects . . . for man is
but a small part. . . . His powers are but particular actions
of Nature, and he cannot have a supreme and absolute
power.’’4
As an aristocrat, Cavendish, the duchess of Newcastle, was a good example of the women in France and
England who worked in science. Women interested in
science who lived in Germany came from a different
background. There the tradition of female participation
in craft production enabled some women to become involved in observational science, especially astronomy.
Between 1650 and 1710, one in every seven German astronomers was a woman.
Maria Winkelmann
The most famous of the female astronomers in Germany
was Maria Winkelmann (1670--1720). She was educated
by her father and uncle and received advanced training
from a local self-taught astronomer. When she married
Gottfried Kirch, Germany’s foremost astronomer, she
became his assistant at the astronomical observatory
operated in Berlin by the Academy of Science. She made
some original contributions, including a hitherto undiscovered comet, as her husband related:
Early in the morning (about 2:00 A.M.) the sky was clear and
starry. Some nights before, I had observed a variable star,
and my wife (as I slept) wanted to find and see it for herself.
In so doing, she found a comet in the sky. At which time she
woke me, and I found that it was indeed a comet. . . . I was
surprised that I had not seen it the night before.5
When her husband died in 1710, she applied for a position as assistant astronomer, for which she was highly
qualified. As a woman, with no university degree, she was
denied the post by the Berlin Academy, which feared
that it would establish a precedent if it hired a woman
(‘‘mouths would gape’’).
Winkelmann’s difficulties with the Berlin Academy
reflect the obstacles women faced in being accepted in
scientific work, which was considered a male preserve.
Although there were no formal statutes excluding women
from membership in the new scientific societies, no
woman was invited to join either the Royal Society of
England or the French Academy of Sciences until the
twentieth century. All of these female scientists were exceptional women because a life devoted to any kind of
scholarship was still viewed as at odds with the domestic
duties women were expected to perform.
Debates on the Nature of Women
The nature and value of women had been the subject of
an ongoing, centuries-long debate. Male opinions in the
debate were largely a carryover from medieval times and
were not favorable. Women were portrayed as inherently base, prone to vice, easily swayed, and ‘‘sexually
insatiable.’’ Hence men needed to control them. Learned
women were viewed as having overcome female liabilities to become like men. One man in praise of a woman
scholar remarked that her writings were so good that
you ‘‘would hardly believe they were done by a woman
at all.’’
In the seventeenth century, women joined this debate
by arguing against the distorted images of women held by
men. They argued that women also had rational minds
and could grow from education. Further, since most
women were pious, chaste, and temperate, there was no
need for male authority over them. These female defenders of women emphasized education as the key to
women’s ability to move into the world. How, then, did
the Scientific Revolution affect this debate over the nature
of women? As an era of intellectual revolution in which
traditional authorities were being overthrown, we might
expect significant change in men’s views of women. But
by and large, instead of becoming an instrument for
liberation, science was used to find new support for the
old, traditional views about a woman’s ‘‘true place’’ in the
scheme of things. New views were used to perpetuate old
stereotypes about women.
An important project in the new anatomy of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was the attempt to
illustrate the human body and skeleton. For Vesalius, the
portrayal of physical differences between males and
females was limited to external bodily form (the outlines
of the body) and the sexual organs. Vesalius saw no
difference in skeletons and portrayed them as the same
for men or women. It was not until the eighteenth
century, in fact, that a new anatomy finally prevailed.
Drawings of female skeletons between 1730 and 1790
varied, but females tended to have a larger pelvic area,
and in some instances, female skulls were portrayed as
smaller than those of males. Eighteenth-century studies
on the anatomy and physiology of sexual differences
provided ‘‘scientific evidence’’ to reaffirm the traditional
inferiority of women. The larger pelvic area ‘‘proved’’
that women were meant to be childbearers, and men’s
larger skull ‘‘demonstrated’’ the superiority of the male
mind. Male-dominated science had been used to ‘‘prove’’
male social dominance.
Overall, the Scientific Revolution reaffirmed traditional ideas about women’s nature. Male scientists used
the new science to spread the view that women were inferior by nature, subordinate to men, and suited by nature to play a domestic role as nurturing mothers. The
widespread distribution of books---written primarily by
men, of course---ensured the continuation of these ideas
(see the box above). Jean de La Bruye`re, the seventeenthcentury French moralist, was typical when he remarked
that an educated woman was like a collector’s item
‘‘which one shows to the curious, but which has no use at
all, any more than a carousel horse.’’6
Toward a New Earth:
Descartes, Rationalism, and
a New View of Humankind
Q Focus Question: Why is Descartes considered the
‘‘founder of modern rationalism’’?
The fundamentally new conception of the universe contained in the cosmological revolution of the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries inevitably had an impact on the
Western view of humankind. Nowhere is this more evident than in the work of the Frenchman Rene´ Descartes
(1596--1650), an extremely important figure in Western
history. Descartes began by reflecting the doubt and uncertainty that seemed pervasive in the confusion of the
seventeenth century and ended with a philosophy that
dominated Western thought until the twentieth century.
The starting point for Descartes’ new system was doubt,
as he explained at the beginning of his most famous work,
Discourse on Method, written in 1637:
From my childhood I have been familiar with letters; and as
I was given to believe that by their means a clear and assured
knowledge can be acquired of all that is useful in life, I was
extremely eager for instruction in them. As soon, however,
as I had completed the course of study, at the close of which
it is customary to be admitted into the order of the learned,
I entirely changed my opinion. For I found myself entangled
in so many doubts and errors that, as it seemed to me, the
endeavor to instruct myself had served only to disclose to me
more and more of my ignorance.7
Descartes decided to set aside all that he had learned and
begin again. One fact seemed beyond doubt---his own
existence:
But I immediately became aware that while I was thus disposed to think that all was false, it was absolutely necessary
that I who thus thought should be something; and noting
that this truth I think, therefore I am, was so steadfast and so
assured that the suppositions of the skeptics, to whatever
extreme they might all be carried, could not avail to shake
it, I concluded that I might without scruple accept it as
being the first principle of the philosophy I was seeking.8
With this emphasis on the mind, Descartes asserted that
he would accept only things that his reason said were true.
From his first postulate, Descartes deduced an additional principle, the separation of mind and matter.
Descartes argued that since ‘‘the mind cannot be
doubted but the body and material world can, the two
must be radically different.’’ From this came an absolute
dualism between mind and matter, what has been called
Cartesian dualism. Using mind or human reason, the
path to certain knowledge, and its best instrument, mathematics, humans can understand the material world because it is pure mechanism, a machine that is governed by
its own physical laws because it was created by God---the
great geometrician.
Descartes’ conclusions about the nature of the universe and human beings had important implications. His
separation of mind and matter allowed scientists to view
matter as dead or inert, as something that was totally
separate from themselves and could be investigated independently by reason. The split between mind and body
led Westerners to equate their identity with mind and
reason rather than with the whole organism. Descartes
has rightly been called the father of modern rationalism.
The radical Cartesian split between mind and matter, and
between mind and body, had devastating implications not
only for traditional religious views of the universe but
also for how Westerners viewed themselves.
The Spread of Scientific
Knowledge
Q Focus Question: How were the ideas of the Scientific
Revolution spread, and what impact did they have on
society and religion?
During the seventeenth century, scientific learning and
investigation began to increase dramatically. Major universities in Europe established new chairs of science, especially in medicine. Royal and princely patronage of
individual scientists became an international phenomenon. Of greater importance to the work of science,
however, was the creation of a scientific method and new
learned societies that enabled the new scientists to communicate their ideas to each other and to disseminate
them to a wider, literate public.
The Scientific Method
In the course of the Scientific Revolution, attention was
paid to the problem of establishing the proper means to
examine and understand the physical realm. The development of a scientific method was crucial to the evolution of science in the modern world. Curiously enough, it
was an Englishman with few scientific credentials who
attempted to put forth a new method of acquiring
knowledge that made an impact on English scientists in
the seventeenth century and other European scientists in
the eighteenth century. Francis Bacon (1561--1626), a
lawyer and lord chancellor, rejected Copernicus and Kepler
and misunderstood Galileo. And yet in his unfinished
work The Great Instauration (The Great Restoration), he
called for his contemporaries ‘‘to commence a total reconstruction of sciences, arts, and all human knowledge,
raised upon the proper foundations.’’ Bacon did not doubt
humans’ ability to know the natural world, but he believed
that they had proceeded incorrectly: ‘‘The entire fabric of
human reason which we employ in the inquisition of
nature is badly put together and built up, and like some
magnificent structure without foundation.’’9
Bacon’s new foundation---a correct scientific method---
was to be built on inductive principles. Rather than
beginning with assumed first principles from which logical conclusions could be deduced, he urged scientists
to proceed from the particular to the general. From
carefully organized experiments and systematic, thorough
observations, correct generalizations could be developed.
Bacon was clear about what he believed his method could
accomplish. His concern was more for practical than for
pure science. He stated that ‘‘the true and lawful goal of
the sciences is none other than this: that human life be
endowed with new discoveries and power.’’ He wanted
science to contribute to the ‘‘mechanical arts’’ by creating
devices that would benefit industry, agriculture, and
trade. Bacon was prophetic when he said that ‘‘I am laboring to lay the foundation, not of any sect or doctrine,
but of human utility and power.’’ And how would this
‘‘human power’’ be used? To ‘‘conquer nature in action.’’10
The control and domination of nature
became a central proposition of modern
science and the technology that accompanied it. Only in the twentieth century did
some scientists ask whether this assumption might not be at the heart of the
modern ecological crisis.
Rene´ Descartes proposed a different
approach to scientific methodology by
emphasizing deduction and mathematical
logic. Descartes believed that one could
start with self-evident truths, comparable
to geometrical axioms, and deduce more
complex conclusions. His emphasis on
deduction and mathematical order complemented Bacon’s stress on experiment
and induction. It was Newton who synthesized them into a single scientific methodology by uniting Bacon’s empiricism
with Descartes’ rationalism. This scientific
method began with systematic observations
and experiments, which were used to arrive
at general concepts. New deductions derived from these general concepts could
then be tested and verified by precise
experiments.
The Scientific Societies
The first of the scientific societies appeared in Italy, but
those of England and France were ultimately of more
significance. The English Royal Society evolved out of
informal gatherings of scientists at London and Oxford in
the 1640s, although it did not receive a formal charter
from King Charles II until 1662. The French Royal
Academy of Sciences also arose out of informal scientific
meetings in Paris during the 1650s. In 1666, Louis XIV
bestowed formal recognition on the group. The French
Academy received abundant state support and remained
under government control; its members were appointed
and paid salaries by the state. In contrast, the Royal Society of England received little government encouragement, and its fellows simply co-opted new members.
Early on, both the English and French scientific societies formally emphasized the practical value of scientific
research. The Royal Society created a committee to investigate technological improvements for industry; the French
Academy collected tools and machines. This concern with
the practical benefits of science proved short-lived, however, as both societies came to focus their primary interest
on theoretical work in mechanics and astronomy. The
construction of observatories at Paris in 1667 and at
Greenwich, England, in 1675 greatly facilitated research in
astronomy by both groups. While both the English and
French societies made useful contributions to scientific
knowledge in the second half of the seventeenth century,
their true significance arose from their example that science
should proceed along the lines of a cooperative venture.
Science and Society
The importance of science in the history of modern
Western civilization is usually taken for granted. But how
did science become such an integral part of Western
culture in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries?
One cannot simply assert that people perceived that science was a rationally superior system. An important social factor, however, might help explain the relatively
rapid acceptance of the new science.
It has been argued that the literate mercantile and
propertied elites of Europe were attracted to new science
because it offered new ways to exploit resources for profit.
Some of the early scientists made it easier for these groups
to accept the new ideas by demonstrating how the ideas
could be applied directly to specific industrial and technological needs. Galileo, for example, consciously sought
an alliance between science and the material interests of
the educated elite when he assured his listeners that the
science of mechanics would be quite useful ‘‘when it becomes necessary to build bridges or other structures over
water, something occurring mainly in affairs of great
importance.’’ At the same time, Galileo stressed that science was fit for the ‘‘minds of the wise’’ and not for ‘‘the
shallow minds of the common people.’’ This made science
part of the high culture of Europe’s wealthy elites at a
time when that culture was being increasingly separated
from the popular culture of the lower classes.
Science and Religion
In Galileo’s struggle with the Holy Office of the Catholic
church, we see the beginning of the conflict between science and religion that has marked the history of modern
Western civilization. Since time immemorial, theology had
seemed to be the queen of the sciences. It was natural that
the churches would continue to believe that religion was
the final measure of everything. The emerging scientists,
however, tried to draw lines between the knowledge of
religion and the knowledge of ‘‘natural philosophy’’ or
nature. Galileo had clearly felt that it was unnecessary to
pit science against religion when he wrote that
in discussions of physical problems we ought to begin not
from the authority of scriptural passages, but from senseexperiences and necessary demonstrations; for the holy Bible
and the phenomena of nature proceed alike from the divine
word, the former as the dictate of the Holy Ghost and the
latter as the observant executrix of God’s commands. It is
necessary for the Bible, in order to be accommodated to the
understanding of every man, to speak many things which appear to differ from the absolute truth so far as the bare meaning of the words is concerned. But Nature, on the other hand,
is inexorable and immutable; she never transgresses the laws
imposed upon her, or cares a whit whether her abstruse reasons and methods of operation are understandable to men.11
To Galileo, it made little sense for the church to
determine the nature of physical reality on the basis of
biblical texts that were subject to radically divergent interpretations. The church, however, decided otherwise in
Galileo’s case and lent its great authority to one scientific
theory, the Ptolemaic-Aristotelian cosmology, no doubt
because it fit so well with its own philosophical views of
reality. But the church’s decision had tremendous consequences. For educated individuals, it established a dichotomy between scientific investigations and religious
beliefs. As the scientific beliefs triumphed, it became almost inevitable that religious beliefs would suffer, leading
to a growing secularization in European intellectual life.
Many seventeenth-century intellectuals were both religious and scientific and believed that the implications of
this split would be tragic. Some believed that the split was
largely unnecessary, while others felt the need to combine
God, humans, and a mechanistic universe into a new
philosophical synthesis.
Pascal Blaise Pascal (1623--1662) was a Frenchman
who sought to keep science and religion united. An accomplished scientist and a brilliant mathematician, Pascal
excelled at both the practical (he invented a calculating
machine) and the abstract (he devised a theory of probability and did work on conic sections). After a profound
mystical vision on the night of November 23, 1654, that
assured him that God cared for the human soul, he devoted the rest of his life to religious matters. He planned
to write an ‘‘apology for the Christian religion’’ but died
before he could do so. He did leave a set of notes for the
larger work, however, which in published form became
known as the Pense´es, or Thoughts.
In the Pense´es, Pascal tried to convert rationalists to
Christianity by appealing to both their reason and their
emotions. Humans were, he argued, frail creatures, often
deceived by their senses, misled by reason, and battered
by their emotions. And yet they were beings whose very
nature involved thinking: ‘‘Man is but a reed, the weakest
in nature; but he is a thinking reed.’’12
Pascal was determined to show that the Christian religion was not contrary to reason: ‘‘If we violate the principles of reason, our religion will be absurd, and it will be
laughed at.’’13 To a Christian, a human being was both
fallen and at the same time God’s special creation. But it
was not necessary to emphasize one at the expense of the
other---to view humans as only rational or only hopeless.
Pascal even had an answer for skeptics in his famous wager:
God is a reasonable bet; it is worthwhile to assume that God
exists. If he does, we win all; if he does not, we lose nothing.
Despite his own background as a scientist and
mathematician, Pascal refused to rely on the scientist’s
world of order and rationality to attract people to God:
‘‘If we submit everything to reason, there will be no
mystery and no supernatural element in our religion.’’ In
the new cosmology of the seventeenth century, ‘‘finite
man,’’ Pascal believed, was lost in the new infinite world, a
realization that frightened him: ‘‘The eternal silence of those
infinite spaces strikes me with terror’’ (see the box above).
The world of nature, then, could never reveal God:
‘‘Because they have failed to contemplate these infinites,
men have rashly plunged into the examination of nature,
as though they bore some proportion to her. . . . Their
assumption is as infinite as their object.’’ A Christian
could only rely on a God who through Jesus cared for
human beings. In the final analysis, after providing reasonable arguments for Christianity, Pascal came to rest on
faith. Reason, he believed, could take people only so far:
‘‘The heart has its reasons of which the reason knows
nothing.’’ As a Christian, faith was the final step: ‘‘The
heart feels God, not the reason. This is what constitutes
faith: God experienced by the heart, not by the reason.’’14
CONCLUSION
The Scientific Revolution marked a major turning point in modern
Western civilization as the Western world overthrew the medieval,
Ptolemaic-Aristotelian worldview and arrived at a new conception
of the universe with the sun at the center, the planets as material
bodies revolving around the sun in elliptical orbits, and an infinite
rather than finite world. With the changes in the conception of
heaven came changes in the conception of earth. The work of Bacon
and Descartes left Europeans with the separation of mind and
matter and the belief that they could understand and dominate the
world of nature using reason alone. The development of a scientific
method furthered the work of scientists, and the creation of
scientific societies and learned journals spread their results.
Although traditional churches stubbornly resisted the new ideas
and a few intellectuals pointed to some inherent flaws, nothing was
able to halt the replacement of the traditional ways of thinking by new
ways that marked a more fundamental break with the past than that
represented by the breakup of Christian unity in the Reformation.
The Scientific Revolution forced Europeans to change their
conception of themselves. At first, some were appalled and even
frightened by its implications. Formerly, humans on earth had been
at the center of the universe. Now the earth was only a tiny planet
revolving around a sun that was itself only a speck in a boundless
universe. Most people remained optimistic despite the apparent
blow to human dignity. After all, had Newton not demonstrated
that the universe was a great machine governed by natural laws?
Newton had found one---the universal law of gravitation. Could
others not find other laws? Were there not natural laws governing
every aspect of human endeavor that could be found by the new
scientific method? Thus the Scientific Revolution leads us logically
to the Enlightenment of the eighteenth century.
