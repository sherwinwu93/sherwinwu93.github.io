<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org77f267f">
<p class="verse">
The end of World War II in Europe was met with great joy.<br />
One visitor to Moscow reported,<br />
&#xa0;'I looked out of the window at 2 A.M., almost everywhere there were lights in the window<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#x2014;people were staying awake.<br />
&#xa0;Everyone embraced everyone else, someone sobbed aloud.'<br />
But after the victory parades and celebrations, Europeans awoke to a devastating realization:<br />
&#xa0;their civilization was in ruins.<br />
Some wondered if Europe would ever regain its former prosperity and importance.<br />
Winston Churchill wrote,<br />
&#xa0;'What is Europe now?<br />
&#xa0;A rubble heap, a charnel house, a breeding ground of pestilence and hate.'<br />
There was ample reason for his pessimism.<br />
Forty million people (both soldiers and civilians) had been killed during the last six years.<br />
Massive air raids and artillery bombardments<br />
&#xa0;had reduced many of the great cities of Europe to heaps of rubble.<br />
An American general described Berlin:<br />
&#xa0;'Wherever we looked we saw desolation.<br />
&#xa0;It was like a city of the dead.<br />
&#xa0;Suffering and shock were visible in every face.<br />
&#xa0;Dead bodies still remained in canals and lakes and were being dug out from under bomb debris.'<br />
Millions of Europeans faced starvation<br />
&#xa0;because grain harvests were only half of what they had been in 1939.<br />
Millions were also homeless.<br />
In the parts of the Soviet Union that had been occupied by the Germans,<br />
&#xa0;almost 25 million people were without homes.<br />
The destruction of bridges, roads, and railroads had left transportation systems paralyzed.<br />
Eleven million prisoners of war had to be returned to their native countries,<br />
&#xa0;and fifteen million Germans and Eastern Europeans were driven out of countries<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;where they were no longer wanted.<br />
Yet despite the chaos, Europe was soon on the road to a remarkable recovery.<br />
Already by 1950, Europe's industrial and agricultural output was 30 percent above prewar levels.<br />
<br />
World War II had also destroyed European supremacy in world affairs.<br />
After 1945, the colonial empires of the European nations rapidly disintegrated,<br />
&#xa0;and Europe's place in the world changed radically.<br />
As the Cold War conflict between the world's two superpowers<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#x2014;the United States and the Soviet Union&#x2014;intensified,<br />
&#xa0;the European nations were divided into two armed camps<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;dependent on one or the other of these two major powers.<br />
The United States and the Soviet Union,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;whose rivalry raised the specter of nuclear war,<br />
&#xa0;seemed to hold the survival of Europe and the world in their hands.<br />
