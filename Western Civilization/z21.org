A meeting of the Congress of Vienna
IN SEPTEMBER 1814, hundreds of foreigners began to converge on Vienna, the capital city of the Austrian Empire. Many were
members of European royalty---kings, princes, archdukes, and their
wives---accompanied by their diplomatic advisers and scores of servants. Their congenial host was the Austrian emperor Francis I, who
never tired of regaling Vienna’s guests with concerts, glittering balls,
sumptuous feasts, and hunting parties. One participant remembered,
‘‘Eating, fireworks, public illuminations. For eight or ten days,
I haven’t been able to work at all. What a life!’’ Of course, not every
waking hour was spent in pleasure during this gathering of notables,
known to history as the Congress of Vienna. These people were also
representatives of all the states that had fought Napoleon, and their
real business was to arrange a final peace settlement after almost a
decade of war. On June 8, 1815, they completed their task.
The forces of upheaval unleashed during the French revolutionary and Napoleonic wars were temporarily quieted in 1815 as rulers
sought to restore stability by reestablishing much of the old order to
a Europe weary of war. Kings, landed aristocrats, and bureaucratic
elites regained their control over domestic governments, while internationally the forces of conservatism tried to maintain the new status
quo; some states even used military force to intervene in the internal
affairs of other countries in their desire to crush revolutions.
But the Western world had been changed, and it would not readily go back to the old system. New ideologies, especially liberalism and
nationalism, both products of the revolutionary upheaval initiated in
France, had become too powerful to be contained. Not content with
the status quo, the forces of change gave rise first to the revolts and
revolutions that periodically shook Europe in the 1820s and 1830s and
then to the widespread revolutions of 1848. Some of the revolutions
and revolutionaries were successful; most were not. Although the old
order usually appeared to have prevailed, by 1850 it was apparent that
its days were numbered. This perception was reinforced by the changes
wrought by the Industrial Revolution. Together the forces unleashed
by the French Revolution and the Industrial Revolution made it impossible to turn back. Nevertheless, although these two revolutions
initiated what historians like to call the modern European world,
remnants of the old persisted in the midst of the new.
The Conservative Order,
1815--1830
Q Focus Question: What were the goals of the Congress
of Vienna and the Concert of Europe, and how
successful were they in achieving those goals?
After the defeat of Napoleon, European rulers moved to
restore the old order. This was the goal of the great
powers---Great Britain, Austria, Prussia, and Russia---when
they met at the Congress of Vienna in September 1814 to
arrange a final peace settlement. The leader of the congress
was the Austrian foreign minister, Prince Klemens von
Metternich (1773--1859), who claimed that he was guided
at Vienna by the principle of legitimacy. To keep peace
and stability in Europe, he said it was necessary to restore
the legitimate monarchs who would preserve traditional
institutions. This had already been done in France by restoring the Bourbon monarchy.
In fact, however, the principle of legitimacy was largely
ignored elsewhere. At the Congress of Vienna, the great
powers all grabbed land to add to their states. They believed that they were forming a new balance of power that
would keep any one country from dominating Europe. For
example, to balance Russian gains, Prussia and Austria had
been strengthened (see Map 21.1). According to Metternich, this arrangement had clearly avoided a great danger:
‘‘Prussia and Austria are completing their systems of defence; united, the two monarchies form an unconquerable
barrier against the enterprises of any conquering prince
who might perhaps once again occupy the throne of
France or that of Russia.’’1
Conservative Domination
The peace arrangements of 1815 were the beginning
of a conservative reaction determined to contain the
liberal and nationalist forces unleashed by the French
Revolution. Metternich and his kind were
representatives of the ideology known as
conservatism (see the box on p. 445). As a
modern political philosophy, conservatism
dates from 1790 when Edmund Burke wrote
Reflections on the Revolution in France in
reaction to the French Revolution, especially
its radical republican and democratic ideas.
Burke maintained that society was a contract, but ‘‘the state ought not to be considered as nothing better than a partnership
agreement in a trade of pepper and coffee, to
be taken up for a temporary interest and
to be dissolved by the fancy of the parties.’’
No one generation has the right to destroy this partnership; each generation has the duty to preserve and
transmit it to the next. Burke advised against the violent
overthrow of a government by revolution, but he did not
reject the possibility of change. Sudden change was unacceptable, but that did not eliminate gradual or evolutionary improvements.
Most conservatives favored obedience to political
authority, believed that organized religion was crucial to
social order, hated revolutionary upheavals, and were
unwilling to accept either the liberal demands for civil
liberties and representative governments or the nationalistic aspirations generated by the French revolutionary era.
The community took precedence over individual rights.
After 1815, the political philosophy of conservatism was
supported by hereditary monarchs, government bureaucracies, landowning aristocracies, and revived churches,
Protestant and Catholic alike. The conservative forces
seemed dominant both internationally and domestically
after 1815.
The Concert of Europe One method used by the great
powers to maintain the new status quo they had constructed was the Concert of Europe, according to which
Great Britain, Russia, Prussia, and Austria (and later
France) agreed to meet periodically in conferences to
discuss their common interests and examine measures
that ‘‘will be judged most salutary . . .for the maintenance
of peace in Europe.’’
Eventually, the five great powers formed the Quintuple Alliance and adopted a principle of intervention
that was based on the right of the great powers to send
armies into countries where revolutions were occurring to
restore legitimate monarchs to their thrones. Britain refused to agree to the principle, arguing that it had never
been the intention of the alliance to interfere in the internal affairs of other states. Ignoring the British response,
Austria, Prussia, Russia, and France used military intervention to defeat revolutionary movements in Spain and
Italy and to restore legitimate (and conservative) monarchs to their thrones. This success for the policy of
intervention came at a price, however. The Concert of
Europe had broken down when the British rejected
Metternich’s principle of intervention and ultimately
prevented the Continental powers from intervening in the
revolutions in Latin America.
The Revolt of Latin America Whereas much of North
America had been freed of European domination in the
eighteenth century by the American Revolution, Latin
America remained in the hands of the Spanish and Portuguese. However, when the Bourbon monarchy of Spain
was toppled by Napoleon Bonaparte, Spanish authority in
its colonial empire was weakened. By 1810, the disintegration of royal power in Argentina had led to that
nation’s independence. In Venezuela, a bitter struggle
for independence was led by Simo´n Bolı ´var, hailed as
‘‘the Liberator.’’ His forces freed Colombia in 1819 and
Venezuela in 1821. A second liberator was Jose´ de San
Martı ´n, who freed Chile in 1817 and then in 1821 moved
on to Lima, Peru, the center of Spanish authority. He was
soon joined by Bolı ´var, who assumed the task of crushing
the last significant Spanish army in 1824. Mexico and the
Central American provinces also achieved their freedom,
and by 1825, after Portugal had recognized the independence of Brazil, almost all of Latin America had been
freed of colonial domination (see Map 21.2).
Although political independence brought economic
independence, old patterns were quickly reestablished.
Instead of Spain and Portugal, Great Britain now dominated the Latin American economy. British merchants
moved in in large numbers, while British investors poured
in funds, especially in the mining industry. Old trade
patterns soon reemerged. Because Latin America served
as a source of raw materials and foodstuffs for the
industrializing nations of Europe and the United States,
exports---especially wheat, tobacco, wool, sugar, coffee, and
hides---to the North Atlantic countries increased noticeably.
At the same time, finished consumer goods, especially
textiles, were imported in increasing quantities, causing a
decline in industrial production in Latin America. As in
India, the emphasis on exporting raw materials and importing finished products ensured the ongoing domination
of the Latin American economy by foreigners.
The Greek Revolt The principle of intervention proved
to be a double-edged sword. Designed to prevent revolution, it could also be used to support revolution if the
great powers found it in their interests to do so. In 1821,
the Greeks revolted against their Ottoman Turkish masters. Although subject to Muslim control for four hundred
years, they had been allowed to maintain their language
and their Greek Orthodox faith. A revival of Greek
national sentiment at the beginning of the nineteenth
century added to the
growing desire for
liberation. The Greek
revolt was soon transformed into a noble
cause by an outpouring of European sentiment for the Greeks’
struggle. In 1827, a
combined British and
French fleet went to
Greece and defeated a
large Ottoman armada.
A year later, Russia
declared war on the
Ottoman Empire and
invaded its European
provinces of Moldavia and Wallachia. By
the Treaty of Adrianople in 1829, which ended the Russian-Turkish war, the
Russians received a protectorate over the two provinces.
By the same treaty, the Ottoman Empire agreed to allow
Russia, France, and Britain to decide the fate of Greece. In
1830, the three powers declared Greece an independent
kingdom, and two years later, a new royal dynasty was
established. The revolution in Greece had been successful
only because the great powers themselves supported it.
The conservative domination was still largely intact.
Conservatives in the European States
Between 1815 and 1830, the conservative domination of
Europe evident in the Concert of Europe was also apparent in domestic affairs as conservative governments
throughout Europe worked to preserve the old order.
Great Britain In 1815, Great Britain was governed by
the aristocratic landowning classes that controlled both
houses of Parliament. Within Parliament, there were two
political factions, the Tories and the Whigs. Both were still
dominated by members of the landed classes, although
the Whigs were beginning to gain support from the new
industrial middle class. Tory ministers largely ran the
government until 1830 and had little desire to change the
existing political and electoral system.
Restoration in France In 1814, the Bourbon family
was restored to the throne of France in the person of
Louis XVIII (1814--1824). Louis understood the need to
accept some of the changes brought to France by the
Revolution and Napoleon. He accepted Napoleon’s Civil
Code, with its recognition of the principle of equality
before the law. The property rights of individuals who
had purchased confiscated lands during the Revolution
were also preserved. In 1824, Louis died and was succeeded by his brother, who became Charles X (1824--
1830). Charles’s attempt to restore the old regime as far as
possible led to public outrage. By 1830, France was on the
brink of another revolution.
The Italian States The Congress of Vienna had established nine states in Italy, including the kingdom of Sardinia
in the north, ruled
by the house of Savoy;
the kingdom of the
Two Sicilies (Naples
and Sicily); the Papal
States; a handful of
small duchies ruled
by relatives of the
Austrian emperor; and
the important northern provinces of Lombardy and Venetia,
which were now part
of the Austrian Empire. Italy was largely
under Austria’s thumb,
and all the states had
extremely reactionary governments eager to smother any
liberal or nationalist sentiment.
Repression in Central Europe After 1815, the forces of
repression were particularly successful in central Europe.
The Habsburg empire and its chief agent, Prince Klemens
von Metternich, played an important role. Metternich
boasted, ‘‘You see in me the chief Minister of Police in
Europe. I keep an eye on everything. My contacts are
such that nothing escapes me.’’3 Metternich’s spies were
everywhere, searching for evidence of liberal or nationalist plots. Metternich worried too much in 1815. Although both liberalism and nationalism emerged in the
German states and the Austrian Empire, they were initially weak as central Europe tended to remain under the
domination of aristocratic landowning classes and autocratic, centralized monarchies.
The Vienna settlement in 1815 had recognized the
existence of thirty-eight sovereign states (called the Germanic Confederation) in what had once been the Holy
Roman Empire. Austria and Prussia were the two major
powers; the other, smaller states varied considerably in
size. The confederation had little real power. It had no
true executive, and its only central organ was the federal
diet, which needed the consent of all member states to
take action.
The Austrian Empire was a multinational state, a
collection of different peoples under the Habsburg emperor, who provided a common bond. The empire contained people of eleven ethnicities, including Germans,
Czechs, Slovaks, Magyars (Hungarians), Romanians,
Slovenes, Poles, Serbs, and Italians. The Germans, accounting for only a quarter of the population, were economically the most advanced and played a leading role in
governing Austria. Although these national groups began
to favor the belief that each national group had the right
to its own system of government, Metternich managed to
repress the nationalist forces and hold the empire together.
Russia: Autocracy of the Tsars At the beginning of the
nineteenth century, Russia was overwhelmingly rural, agricultural, and autocratic. The Russian tsar was still regarded as a divine-right monarch. Alexander I (1801--1825)
had been raised in the ideas of the Enlightenment and
initially seemed willing to make reforms. He relaxed censorship, freed political prisoners, and reformed the educational system. But after the defeat of Napoleon, Alexander
became a reactionary, and his government reverted to strict
and arbitrary censorship. His brother Nicholas I (1825--
1855), who succeeded him, became a strict reactionary after
a military revolt at the beginning of his reign. Nicholas
strengthened both the bureaucracy and the secret police to
maintain order. There would be no revolutions in Russia
during the rest of his reign; if he could help it, there would
be none in Europe either. Contemporaries called him the
Policeman of Europe because of his willingness to use
Russian troops to crush uprisings.
The Ideologies of Change
Q Focus Question: What were the main tenets of
conservatism, liberalism, nationalism, and utopian
socialism, and what role did each ideology play in
Europe in the first half of the nineteenth century?
Although conservative forces were in the ascendancy from
1815 to 1830, powerful movements for change were also
at work. These depended on ideas embodied in a series of
political philosophies or ideologies that came into their
own in the first half of the nineteenth century.
Liberalism
One of these ideologies was liberalism, which owed
much to the Enlightenment of the eighteenth century and
the American and French Revolutions. It was based on
the belief that people should be as free from restraint as
possible. This opinion is evident in both economic and
political liberalism.
Economic Liberalism Also called classical economics,
economic liberalism has as its primary tenet the concept
of laissez-faire, the belief that the state should not interrupt the free play of natural economic forces, especially
supply and demand. Government should not interfere
with the economic liberty of the individual and should
restrict itself to only three primary functions: defense of
the country, police protection of individuals, and the
construction and maintenance of public works too expensive for individuals to undertake.
Political Liberalism Politically, liberals came to hold a
common set of beliefs. Chief among them was the protection of civil liberties or the basic rights of all people,
which included equality before the law; freedom of assembly, speech, and the press; and freedom from arbitrary
arrest. All of these freedoms should be guaranteed by a
written document, such as the Bill of Rights appended to
the U.S. Constitution. In addition to religious toleration
for all, most liberals advocated separation of church and
state. The right of peaceful opposition to the government
in and out of parliament and the making of laws by a
representative assembly (legislature) elected by qualified
voters constituted two other liberal demands. Many liberals believed, then, in a constitutional monarchy or
constitutional state with limits on the powers of government in order to prevent despotism and in written
constitutions that would also help guarantee these rights.
Many liberals also advocated ministerial responsibility, a system in which ministers of the king were responsible
to the legislature rather than to the king, giving the legislative branch a check on the power of the executive. Liberals
in the first half of the nineteenth century also believed in a
limited suffrage. While all people were entitled to equal civil
rights, they should not have equal political rights. The right
to vote and hold office would be open only to men who
met certain property qualifications. As a political philosophy, liberalism was tied to middle-class and especially
industrial middle-class men who favored the extension of
voting rights so that they could share power with the
landowning classes. They had little desire to let the lower
classes share that power. Liberals were not democrats.
One of the most prominent advocates of liberalism in
the nineteenth century was the English philosopher John
Stuart Mill (1806--1873). On Liberty, his most famous
work, published in 1859, has long been regarded as a
classic statement on the liberty of the individual (see the
box above). Mill argued for an ‘‘absolute freedom of
opinion and sentiment on all subjects’’ that needed to be
protected from both government censorship and the
tyranny of the majority.
Mill was also instrumental in expanding the meaning
of liberalism by becoming an enthusiastic supporter of
women’s rights. When his attempt to include women in the
voting reform bill of 1867 failed, Mill published an essay
titled On the Subjection of Women, which he had written
earlier with his wife, Harriet Taylor. He argued that ‘‘the
legal subordination of one sex to the other’’ was wrong.
Differences between women and men, he claimed, were due
not to different natures but simply to social practices. With
equal education, women could achieve as much as men. On
the Subjection of Women would become an important work
in the nineteenth-century movement for women’s rights.
Nationalism
Nationalism was an even more powerful ideology for
change in the nineteenth century. Nationalism arose out
of an awareness of being part of a community that has
common institutions, traditions, language, and customs.
This community is called a nation, and the primary political loyalty of individuals would be to the nation. Nationalism did not become a popular force for change until
the French Revolution. From then on, nationalists came
to believe that each nationality should have its own
government. Thus a divided people such as the Germans
wanted national unity in a German nation-state with one
central government. Subject peoples, such as the Hungarians, wanted the right to establish their own autonomy, rather than be subject to a German minority in a
multinational empire.
Because nationalism threatened to upset the existing
political order (see Map 21.3), it was fundamentally
radical. A united Germany or united Italy would upset the
balance of power established in 1815. By the same token,
an independent Hungarian state would mean the breakup
of the Austrian Empire. Because many European states
were multinational, conservatives tried hard to repress the
radical threat of nationalism.
At the same time, in the first half of the nineteenth
century, nationalism and liberalism became strong allies.
Most liberals believed that freedom could be realized only
by peoples who ruled themselves. One British liberal said,
‘‘It is in general a necessary condition of free institutions
that the boundaries of government should coincide in the
main with those of nationalities.’’ Many nationalists believed that once each people obtained its own state, all
nations could be linked into a broader community of all
humanity.
Early Socialism
In the first half of the nineteenth century, the pitiful
conditions found in the slums, mines, and factories of
the Industrial Revolution gave rise to another ideology
for change known as socialism. The term eventually
became associated with a Marxist analysis of human
society (see Chapter 22), but early socialism was largely
the product of political theorists or intellectuals who
wanted to introduce equality into social conditions
and believed that human cooperation was superior to
the competition that characterized early industrial
capitalism. To later Marxists, such ideas were impractical dreams, and they contemptuously labeled the
theorists utopian socialists. The term has endured to
this day.
The utopian socialists were against private property
and the competitive spirit of early industrial capitalism.
By eliminating these things and creating new systems of
social organization, they thought, a better environment
for humanity could be achieved. One prominent utopian
socialist was Robert Owen (1771--1858), a British cotton
manufacturer who believed that humans would reveal
their true natural goodness if they lived in a cooperative
environment. At New Lanark in Scotland, he was successful in transforming a squalid factory town into a
flourishing, healthy community. But when he attempted
to create a self-contained cooperative community at New
Harmony, Indiana, in the United States in the 1820s,
bickering within the community eventually destroyed his
dream.
The utopian socialists’ plans for the reconstruction of
society attracted a number of female supporters who believed that only a reordering of society would help women.
One of Owen’s disciples, a wealthy woman named Frances
Wright, bought slaves in order to set up a model community at Nashoba, Tennessee. The community did not
survive, but Wright continued to work for women’s rights.
Revolution and Reform,
1830--1850
Q Focus Questions: What forces for change were present
in France and Great Britain between 1830 and 1848,
and how did each nation respond? What were the
causes of the revolutions of 1848, and why did the
revolutions fail?
Beginning in 1830, the forces of change began to break
through the conservative domination of Europe, more
successfully in some places than in others.
The Revolutions of 1830
In France, the attempt of the ultraroyalists under the
Bourbon monarch Charles X (1824--1830) to restore the
old regime as far as possible led to a revolt by liberals in
1830 known as the July Revolution. Barricades went up in
Paris as a provisional government led by a group of
moderate, propertied liberals was hastily formed and
appealed to Louis-Philippe, a cousin of Charles X, to
become the constitutional king of France. Charles X fled
to Britain; a new monarchy had been born.
Louis-Philippe (1830--1848) was soon called the
bourgeois monarch because political support for his rule
came from the upper middle class. Louis-Philippe even
dressed like a member of the middle class, in business
suits and hats. Constitutional changes that favored the
interests of the upper bourgeoisie were instituted.
Financial qualifications for voting were reduced yet
remained sufficiently high that the number of voters only
increased from 100,000 to barely 200,000, continuing to
guarantee that only the wealthiest men would vote. To the
upper middle class, the bourgeois monarchy represented
the stopping place for political progress.
Supporters of liberalism played a primary role in the
revolution in France, but nationalism was the crucial force
in three other revolutionary outbursts in 1830. In an effort
to create a stronger, larger state on France’s northern
border, the Congress of Vienna had added the area once
known as the Austrian Netherlands (modern-day Belgium)
to the Dutch Republic. The merger of Catholic Belgium
into the Protestant Dutch Republic never sat well with the
Belgians, however, and in 1830, they rose up against the
Dutch and succeeded in convincing the major European
powers to accept their independence. The revolutionary
scenarios in Poland and Italy were much less successful.
Russian forces crushed the attempt of Poles to liberate
themselves from foreign domination, and Metternich sent
Austrian troops to crush revolts in three Italian states.
The successful July Revolution in France served to
catalyze change in Britain. The Industrial Revolution had
led to an expanding group of industrial leaders who objected to the corrupt British electoral system, which excluded them from political power. The Whigs, though
also members of the landed classes, realized that
concessions to reform were superior to
revolution; the demands of the wealthy
industrial middle class could no longer
be ignored. In 1832, Parliament passed
a reform bill that increased the numbers of male voters, primarily benefiting the upper middle class; the lower
middle class, artisans, and industrial
workers still had no vote. Nevertheless,
a significant step had been taken. The
‘‘monied, manufacturing, and educated elite’’ had been joined to the
landed interest in ruling Britain. As a
result of reforms, Britain would be immune to the revolutionary disturbances
of 1848.
The Revolutions of 1848
Despite the successful revolutions in
France, Belgium, and Greece, the conservative order remained in control of
much of Europe. But liberalism and
nationalism continued to grow. In
1848, these forces of change erupted
once more. Yet again, revolution in
France provided the spark for other
countries, and soon most of central and southern Europe
was ablaze with revolutionary fires. Tsar Nicholas I of
Russia lamented to Queen Victoria in April 1848, ‘‘What
remains standing in Europe? Great Britain and Russia.’’
Another French Revolution A severe industrial and
agricultural depression beginning in 1846 brought great
hardship in France to the lower middle class, workers,
and peasants. Scandals, graft, and corruption were rife,
and the government’s persistent refusal to extend the
suffrage angered the disfranchised members of the middle
class. As Louis-Philippe’s government continued to refuse
to make changes, opposition grew and finally overthrew
the monarchy on February 24, 1848. A group of moderate
and radical republicans established a provisional government and called for the election by universal male
suffrage of a ‘‘constituent assembly’’ that would draw up a
new constitution.
The provisional government also established national
workshops, which were supposed to be cooperative factories run by the workers. In fact, the workshops came to
provide jobs for unemployed workers, consisting primarily
of leaf raking and ditch digging. The cost of the program
became increasingly burdensome to the government.
The result was a growing split between the moderate
republicans, who had the support of most of France,
and the radical republicans, whose main support came
from the Parisian working class. From March to June,
the number of unemployed enrolled in the national
workshops rose from 10,000 to almost 120,000, emptying the treasury and frightening the moderates, who
responded by closing the workshops on June 23. The
workers refused to accept this decision and poured into
the streets. Four days of bitter and bloody fighting by
government forces crushed the working-class revolt.
Thousands were killed, and four thousand prisoners
were deported to the French colony of Algeria in northern
Africa.
The new constitution, ratified in November, established a republic (the Second Republic) with a one-house
legislature with 750 members elected by universal male
suffrage for three years and a president, also elected by
universal male suffrage, for four years. In the elections for
the presidency held in December 1848, Charles Louis
Napoleon Bonaparte, the nephew of the famous French
ruler, won a resounding victory.
Revolution in the Germanic States News of the revolution in Paris in February 1848 led to upheavals in
central Europe as well (see the box on p. 454). Revolutionary cries for change caused many German rulers to
promise constitutions, a free press, jury trials, and other
liberal reforms. Concessions to appease the revolutionaries were also made in Prussia. King Frederick William
IV (1840--1861) agreed to abolish censorship, establish
a new constitution, and work for a united Germany.
This last promise had its counterpart throughout all the
German states as governments allowed elections by
universal male suffrage for deputies to an all-German
parliament. Its purpose was to fulfill a liberal and nationalist dream---the preparation of a constitution for a
new united Germany.
But the Frankfurt Assembly, as the parliament was
called, failed to achieve its goals. Although some members
spoke of using force, they had no real means of compelling the German rulers to accept the constitution they
had drawn up. The attempt of the German liberals at
Frankfurt to create a German state had failed.
Upheaval in the Austrian Empire The Austrian Empire
also had its social, political, and nationalist grievances
and needed only the news of the revolution in Paris to
encourage it to erupt in flames in March 1848. The
Hungarian liberals under Louis Kossuth agitated for
‘‘commonwealth’’ status; they were willing to keep the
Habsburg monarch but wanted their own legislature. In
March, demonstrations in Buda, Prague, and Vienna led
to Metternich’s dismissal, and the archsymbol of the
conservative order fled abroad. In Vienna, revolutionary
forces, carefully guided by the educated and propertied
classes, took control of the capital and insisted that a
constituent assembly be summoned to draw up a liberal
constitution. Hungary was granted its wish for its own
legislature, a separate national army, and control over
foreign policy and budget. In Bohemia, the Czechs began
to demand their own government as well.
Although Emperor Ferdinand I (1835--1848) and
Austrian officials had made concessions to appease the
revolutionaries, they awaited an opportunity to reestablish their firm control. As in the German states, they were
increasingly encouraged by the divisions between radical
and moderate revolutionaries and played on the middleclass fear of a working-class social revolution. Their first
success came in June 1848 when Austrian military forces
under General Alfred Windischgra¨tz ruthlessly suppressed
the Czech rebels in Prague. By the end of October, radical
rebels had been crushed in Vienna. In December, the
feebleminded Ferdinand agreed to abdicate in favor of his
nephew, Francis Joseph I (1848--1916), who worked vigorously to restore the imperial government in Hungary.
The Austrian armies, however, were unable to defeat
Kossuth’s forces, and it was only through the intervention
of Nicholas I, who sent a Russian army of 140,000 men to
aid the Austrians, that the Hungarian revolution was
finally crushed in 1849. The revolutions in the Austrian
Empire had also failed.
Revolts in the Italian States The failure of revolutionary uprisings in Italy in 1830 and 1831 had encouraged the Italian movement for unification to take a new
direction. The leadership of Italy’s resurgence passed into
the hands of Giuseppe Mazzini (1805--1872), a dedicated
Italian nationalist who founded an organization known as
Young Italy in 1831. This group set as its goal the creation
of a united Italian republic. In The Duties of Man, Mazzini
urged Italians to dedicate their lives to the Italian nation:
‘‘O my Brother! Love your country. Our Country is
our home.’’ A number of Italian women also took up
Mazzini’s call. Especially notable was Cristina Belgioioso
(1808--1871), a wealthy aristocrat who worked to bring
about Italian unification. Pursued by the Austrian authorities, she fled to Paris and started a newspaper to
espouse the Italian cause.
The dreams of Mazzini and Belgioioso seemed on the
verge of fulfillment when a number of Italian states rose in
revolt in 1848. Beginning in Sicily, rebellions spread
northward as ruler after ruler granted a constitution to his
people. Citizens in Lombardy and Venetia also rebelled
against their Austrian overlords. The Venetians declared a
republic in Venice. The king of the northern Italian state of
Piedmont, Charles Albert (1831--1849), took up the call
and assumed the leadership for a war of liberation from
Austrian domination. His invasion of Lombardy proved
unsuccessful, however, and by 1849 the Austrians had reestablished complete control over Lombardy and Venetia.
Counterrevolutionary forces also prevailed throughout Italy as Italian rulers managed to recover power on their own.
Only Piedmont was able to keep its liberal constitution.
The Failures of 1848 Throughout Europe in 1848,
popular revolts had initiated revolutionary upheavals that
had prodded the formation of liberal constitutions and
liberal governments. But the failure of the revolutionaries
to stay united soon led to the reestablishment of the old
regimes. In 1848, nationalities everywhere had also revolted in pursuit of self-government. But again, frightfully
little was achieved because divisions among nationalities
proved utterly disastrous. Though the Hungarians demanded autonomy from the Austrians, at the same time
they refused the same to their minorities---the Slovenes,
Croats, and Serbs. Instead of joining together against the
old empire, minorities fought each other.
The Maturing of the United States The United States
Constitution, ratified in 1789, committed the nation to
two of the major philosophies of the first half of the
nineteenth century: liberalism and nationalism. Initially,
the constitutional commitment to national unity was
challenged by divisions over the power of the federal
government vis-a`-vis the individual states. Bitter conflict
erupted between the Federalists and the Republicans. Led
by Alexander Hamilton (1757--1804), the Federalists favored a financial program that would establish a strong
central government. The Republicans, guided by Thomas
Jefferson (1743--1826) and James Madison (1751--1836),
feared centralization and its consequences for popular
liberties. These divisions were intensified by European
rivalries because the Federalists were pro-British and
the Republicans pro-French. The successful conclusion of
the War of 1812 against the British brought an end to the
Federalists, who had opposed the war, while the surge of
national feeling generated by the war served to heal the
nation’s divisions.
Another strong force for national unity came from the
Supreme Court while John Marshall (1755--1835) was chief
justice from 1801 to 1835. Marshall made the Supreme
Court into an important national institution by asserting
the right of the Court to overrule an act of Congress if the
Court found it to be in violation of the Constitution.
Under Marshall, the Supreme Court contributed further to
establishing the supremacy of the national government by
curbing the actions of state courts and legislatures.
The election of Andrew Jackson (1767--1845) as
president in 1828 opened a new era in American politics
characterized by the extension of democratic politics to
the masses. The electorate was expanded by dropping
traditional property qualifications; by the end of Jackson’s
presidency, suffrage had been extended to almost all adult
white males.
Culture in an Age of Reaction
and Revolution: The Mood
of Romanticism
Q Focus Question: What were the characteristics of
Romanticism, and how were they reflected in
literature, art, and music?
At the end of the eighteenth century, a new intellectual
movement known as Romanticism emerged to challenge
the Enlightenment’s preoccupation with reason in discovering truth. The Romantics tried to balance the use of
reason by stressing the importance of feeling, emotion,
and imagination as sources of knowing. As one German
Romantic put it, ‘‘It was my heart that counseled me to
do it, and my heart cannot err.’’
The Characteristics of Romanticism
Romantic writers emphasized emotion, sentiment, and
inner feelings in their works. An important model for
Romantics was the tragic figure in The Sorrows of Young
Werther, a novel by the great German writer Johann
Wolfgang von Goethe (1749--1832), who later rejected
Romanticism in favor of classicism. Werther was a
Romantic figure who sought freedom as the source of
personal fulfillment. Misunderstood and rejected by
society, he continued to believe in his own worth
through his inner feelings, but his deep love for a girl
who did not love him finally led him to commit suicide.
After Goethe’s Sorrows of Young Werther, numerous
novels and plays appeared whose plots revolved around
young maidens tragically carried off at an early age
(twenty-three was most common) by disease (usually
tuberculosis, at that time a protracted disease that was
usually fatal) to the sorrow and sadness of their male
lovers.
Another important characteristic of Romanticism
was individualism, an interest in the unique traits of each
person. The Romantics’ desire to follow their inner drives
led them to rebel against middle-class conventions. Long
hair, beards, and outrageous clothes served to reinforce
the individualism that young Romantics were trying to
express.
Many Romantics possessed a passionate interest in
the past. In Germany, brothers Jacob and Wilhelm
Grimm collected and published local fairy tales, as Hans
Christian Andersen did in Denmark. The revival of
Gothic architecture left European countrysides adorned
with pseudo-medieval castles and cities bedecked with
grandiose neo-Gothic cathedrals, city halls, parliamentary
buildings, and even railway stations. Literature, too, reflected this historical consciousness. The novels of Walter
Scott (1771--1832) became European best-sellers in the
first half of the nineteenth century. Ivanhoe, in which Scott
worked to evoke the clash between Saxon and Norman
knights in medieval England, became one of his most
popular works.
To the historical-mindedness of the Romantics could
be added an attraction to the bizarre and unusual. In an
exaggerated form, this preoccupation gave rise to socalled Gothic literature (see the box on p. 458), chillingly
evident in short stories of horror by the American Edgar
Allan Poe (1808--1849) and in Frankenstein by Mary
Wollstonecraft Shelley (1797--1851). Shelley’s novel was
the story of a mad scientist who brings into being a humanlike monster who goes berserk. Some Romantics even
sought the unusual in their own lives by experimenting
with cocaine, opium, and hashish to achieve altered states
of consciousness.
Romantic Poets and the Love of Nature
To the Romantics, poetry ranked above all other literary
forms because they believed it was the direct expression
of one’s soul. The Romantic poets were viewed as seers
who could reveal the invisible world to others. Their
sense of drama made some of them the most colorful
figures of their era, living intense but short lives. Percy
Bysshe Shelley (1792--1822), expelled from school for
advocating atheism, set out to reform the world. His
Prometheus Unbound, completed in 1820, is a portrait of
the revolt of human beings against the laws and customs
that oppress them. He drowned in a storm in the
Mediterranean. George Gordon, Lord Byron (1788--
1824), dramatized himself as the melancholy Romantic
hero that he had described in his own work, Childe
Harold’s Pilgrimage. He participated in the movement
for Greek independence and died in Greece fighting the
Ottomans.
Romantic poetry gave full expression to one of the
most important characteristics of Romanticism: love of
nature, especially evident in the works of William
Wordsworth (1770--1850). His experience of nature was
almost mystical as he claimed to receive ‘‘authentic tidings
of invisible things’’:
One impulse from a vernal wood
May teach you more of man,
Of Moral Evil and of good,
Than all the sages can.4
To Wordsworth, nature contained a mysterious force
that the poet could perceive and learn from. Nature
served as a mirror into which humans could look to
learn about themselves. Nature was, in fact, alive and
sacred:
To every natural form, rock, fruit or flower,
Even the loose stones that cover the high-way,
I gave a moral life, I saw them feel,
Or link’d them to some feeling: the great mass
Lay bedded in a quickening soul, and all
That I beheld, respired with inward meaning.5
Other Romantics carried this worship of nature further
into pantheism by identifying the great force in nature
with God. As the German Romantic poet Friedrich
Novalis said, ‘‘Anyone seeking God will find him
anywhere.’’
Romanticism in Art
Like the literary arts, the visual arts were also deeply affected by Romanticism. To Romantic artists, all artistic
expression was a reflection of the artist’s inner feelings; a
painting should mirror the artist’s vision of the world and
be the instrument of his own imagination. Moreover,
Romantic artists deliberately rejected the principles of
classicism. Beauty was not a timeless thing; its expression
depended on one’s culture and one’s age. The Romantics
abandoned classical restraint for warmth, emotion, and
movement.
The early life experiences of the German painter
Caspar David Friedrich (1774--1840) left him with a
lifelong preoccupation with God and nature. Friedrich
painted landscapes, but with an interest that transcended
the mere presentation of natural details. His portrayal of
mountains shrouded in mist, gnarled trees bathed in
moonlight, and the stark ruins of monasteries all conveyed a feeling of mystery and mysticism. For Friedrich,
nature was a manifestation of divine life, as is evident in
Man and Woman Gazing at the Moon. To Friedrich, the
artistic process depended on the use of an unrestricted
imagination that could only be achieved through inner
vision. He advised artists, ‘‘Shut your physical eye and
look first at your picture with your spiritual eye, then
bring to the light of day what you have seen in the
darkness.’’
Euge`ne Delacroix (1798--1863) was one of the most
famous French exponents of the Romantic school of
painting. Delacroix’s paintings exhibited a fascination
with the exotic and a passion for color, exemplified
by Death of Sardanapalus. In Delacroix, theatricality
and movement combined with a daring color palette.
Many of his works reflect his belief that ‘‘a painting should
be a feast to the eye.’’
Romanticism in Music
To many Romantics, music was the most Romantic of the
arts because it enabled the composer to probe deeply into
human emotions. Music historians have called the eighteenth century the age of classicism and the nineteenth
the era of Romanticism. One of the greatest composers
of all time, Ludwig van Beethoven, served as a bridge
between the two.
Beethoven (1770--1827) was born in Bonn, Germany,
but soon made his way to Vienna, then the musical capital
of Europe. During his first major period of composing,
from 1792 to 1802, his work was still largely within the
classical framework of the eighteenth century, and the influences of Mozart and Haydn were paramount. But with
the composition of the Third Symphony (1804), the Eroica,
originally intended for Napoleon, Beethoven broke through
to Romanticism in his use of uncontrolled rhythms to create
dramatic struggle and uplifted resolutions. E. T. A. Hoffman, a contemporary composer and writer, said, ‘‘Beethoven’s music opens the flood gates of fear, of terror, of
horror, of pain, and arouses that longing for the eternal
which is the essence of Romanticism. He is thus a pure
Romantic composer.’’6 Beethoven went on to write a vast
quantity of works, but in the midst of this productivity and
growing fame, he was more and more burdened by his
growing deafness. One of the most moving pieces of
music of all time, the chorale finale of his Ninth Symphony, was composed when Beethoven was totally deaf.
CONCLUSION
In 1815, a conservative order was reestablished throughout Europe,
and the cooperation of the great powers, embodied in the Concert
of Europe, tried to ensure its durability. But the revolutionary waves
of the 1820s and early 1830s made it clear that the ideologies of
liberalism and nationalism, unleashed by the French Revolution
and now reinforced by the spread of the Industrial Revolution, were
still alive and active. They faced enormous difficulties, however, as
failed revolutions in Poland, Russia, Italy, and Germany all testify.
At the same time, reform legislation in Britain and successful
revolutions in Greece, France, and Belgium demonstrated the
continuing strength of these forces of change. In 1848, they erupted
once more all across Europe. And once more they failed. But all was
not lost. Both liberalism and nationalism would succeed in the
second half of the nineteenth century, but in ways not foreseen by
the idealistic liberals and nationalists, who were utterly convinced
that their time had come when they manned the barricades in 1848.
