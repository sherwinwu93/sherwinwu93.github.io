CONCLUSION
When the Augustinian monk Martin Luther burst onto the scene
with a series of theses objecting to indulgences, few people
suspected that his observations would eventually split all of Europe
along religious lines. But the yearning for reform of the church and
meaningful religious experience caused a seemingly simple dispute
to escalate into a powerful movement.
Although Luther felt that his revival of Christianity based on
his interpretation of the Bible should be acceptable to all, others
soon appeared who also read the Bible but interpreted it in different
ways. Protestantism fragmented into a number of sects, which,
though united in their dislike of Catholicism, were themselves
divided over the interpretation of the sacraments and religious
practices. As reform ideas spread, religion and politics became ever
more intertwined.
By 1555, Lutheranism had lost much of its momentum;
its energy was largely replaced by the new Calvinist form
of Protestantism, which had a clarity of doctrine and a fervor
that made it attractive to a whole new generation of Europeans.
Although Calvinism’s militancy enabled it to expand across Europe,
Catholicism was also experiencing its own revival and emerged as a
militant faith. This age of religious passion was followed by an age
of religious warfare.
That people who were disciples of the Apostle of Peace would
kill each other over their beliefs aroused skepticism about
Christianity itself. As one German writer put it, ‘‘Lutheran, popish,
and Calvinistic, we’ve got all these beliefs here; but there is some
doubt about where Christianity has got.’’13 It is surely no accident
that the search for a stable, secular order of politics and for order in
the universe through natural laws soon came to play important
roles. Before we look at this search for order in the seventeenth
century, however, we need first to look at the adventures that
plunged Europe into its new role in the world.
