The storming of the Bastille
ON THE MORNING of July 14, 1789, a Parisian mob of some
eight thousand people in search of weapons streamed toward the
Bastille, a royal armory filled with arms and ammunition. The Bastille
was also a state prison, and although it now contained only seven
prisoners, in the eyes of these angry Parisians it was a glaring symbol
of the government’s despotic policies. The armory was defended by
the marquis de Launay and a small garrison of 114 men. The attack
began in earnest in the early afternoon, and after three hours of fighting, de Launay and the garrison surrendered. Angered by the loss of
ninety-eight of their members, the victorious mob beat de Launay to
death, cut off his head, and carried it aloft in triumph through the
streets of Paris. When King Louis XVI was informed of the fall of the
Bastille by the duc de La Rochefoucauld-Liancourt, he exclaimed,
‘‘Why, this is a revolt.’’ ‘‘No, Sire,’’ replied the duke, ‘‘it is a revolution.’’
Historians have long held that the modern history of Europe
began with two significant transformations---the French Revolution
and the Industrial Revolution (on the latter, see Chapter 20). Accordingly, the French Revolution has been portrayed as the major
turning point in European political and social history when the
institutions of the ‘‘old regime’’ were destroyed and a new order was
created based on individual rights, representative institutions, and a
concept of loyalty to the nation rather than the monarch. This perspective has certain limitations, however.
France was only one of a number of places in the Western world
where the assumptions of the old order were challenged. Although
some historians have used the phrase ‘‘democratic revolution’’ to refer
to the upheavals of the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, it is
probably more appropriate to speak not of a democratic movement but
of a liberal movement to extend political rights and power to the bourgeoisie ‘‘possessing capital,’’ people not of the aristocracy who were literate and had become wealthy through capitalist enterprises in trade,
industry, and finance. The years preceding and accompanying the
French Revolution included attempts at reform and revolt in the North
American colonies, Britain, the Dutch Republic, some Swiss cities, and
the Austrian Netherlands. The success of the American and French
Revolutions makes them the center of attention for this chapter.
Not all of the decadent privileges that characterized the old
European regime were destroyed in 1789, however. The revolutionary upheaval of the era, especially in France, did create new liberal and national
political ideals, summarized in the French revolutionary slogan, ‘‘Liberty,
Equality, Fraternity,’’ that transformed France and were then spread
to other European countries through the conquests of Napoleon.
The Beginning of the Revolutionary
Era: The American Revolution
Q Focus Question: What were the causes and results of
the American Revolution, and what impact did it have
on Europe?
At the end of the Seven Years’ War in 1763, Great Britain
had become the world’s greatest colonial power. In North
America, Britain controlled Canada and the lands east of
the Mississippi. After the Seven Years’ War, British policy
makers sought to obtain new revenues from the thirteen
American colonies to pay for British army expenses in
defending the colonists. An attempt to levy new taxes by the
Stamp Act in 1765 led to riots and the law’s quick repeal.
The Americans and the British had different conceptions of empire. The British envisioned a single empire
with Parliament as the supreme authority throughout.
Only Parliament could make laws for all the people in the
empire, including the American colonists. The Americans, in contrast, had their own representative assemblies.
They believed that neither the king nor Parliament had
any right to interfere in their internal affairs and that no
tax could be levied without the consent of the people or
their chosen representatives.
Crisis followed crisis in the 1770s until 1776, when
the colonists decided to declare their independence from
the British Empire. On July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress released a declaration written by Thomas
Jefferson. A stirring political document, the Declaration
of Independence affirmed the Enlightenment’s natural
rights of ‘‘life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness’’ and
declared the colonies to be ‘‘free and independent states
absolved from all allegiance to the British crown.’’ The
war for American independence had begun---not with a
gun but with a page of parchment.
The War for Independence
The war against Great Britain was a huge gamble. Britain
was a strong European military power with enormous
financial resources. The Second Continental Congress had
authorized the formation of the Continental Army under
George Washington as commander in chief. Washington,
who had had political experience in Virginia and military
experience in the French and Indian War, was a good
choice for the job. As a southerner, he brought balance to
an effort that to that point had been led by New Englanders. Nevertheless, compared to the British forces, the
Continental Army consisted of undisciplined amateurs
whose terms of service were usually very brief.
Complicating the war effort were the internal divisions
within the colonies. Fought for independence, the Revolutionary War was also a civil war, pitting family members
and neighbors against one another. The Loyalists, 15 to
30 percent of the population, questioned whether British
policies justified the rebellion.
Since probably half of the people living in the colonies
were apathetic at the start of the struggle, the Patriots, like
the Loyalists, constituted a minority of the population. The
Patriots, however, managed to win over many of the uncommitted, either by persuasion or by force. There were
rich Patriots as well; Washington owned an estate with
15,000 acres and 150 slaves. But the rich Patriots joined an
extensive coalition that included farmers and artisans. The
wide social spectrum in this coalition had an impact on
representative governments in the states after the war. The
right to vote was often broadened; Pennsylvania, for example, dropped all property qualifications for voting.
Of great importance to the colonists’ cause was the
assistance provided by foreign countries that were eager
to gain revenge for earlier defeats at the hands of the
British. The French supplied arms and money to the
rebels from the beginning of the war, and French officers
and soldiers also served in the Continental Army. When
the British army of General Cornwallis was forced to surrender to a combined American and French army and
French fleet under Washington at Yorktown in 1781, the
British government decided to call it quits. The Treaty of
Paris, signed in 1783, recognized the independence of the
American colonies and granted the Americans control of
the territory from the Appalachians to the Mississippi River.
Forming a New Nation
The thirteen American colonies had gained their independence as the United States of America, but a fear of
concentrated power and concern for their own interests
caused them to have little enthusiasm for establishing a
united nation with a strong central government. The
Articles of Confederation, ratified in 1781, gave most
power to the states and little to the central government.
But that arrangement proved unworkable, and a movement
for reform soon arose. In the summer of 1787, fifty-five
delegates attended a convention in Philadelphia to revise
the Articles of Confederation. The convention’s delegates---
wealthy, politically experienced, and well educated---rejected
revision and decided to devise a new constitution.
The proposed constitution created a central government distinct from and superior to the governments of the
individual states. The national government was given the
power to levy taxes, raise a national army, regulate domestic
and foreign trade, and create a national currency. The
central or federal government was divided into three
branches, each with some power to check the functioning
of the others. A president would serve as the chief executive,
with the power to execute laws, veto the legislature’s acts,
supervise foreign affairs, and direct military forces. Legislative power was vested in the second branch of government, a bicameral legislature composed of the Senate,
elected by the state legislatures, and the House of Representatives, elected directly by the people. The Supreme
Court and other courts ‘‘as deemed necessary’’ by Congress
served as the third branch of government. They would
enforce the Constitution as the ‘‘supreme law of the land.’’
The United States Constitution was approved by the
states---by a slim margin---in 1788. Important to its success
was the promise to add to it a ‘‘bill of rights’’ as the new
government’s first piece of business. Accordingly, in March
1789, the new Congress proposed twelve amendments to
the Constitution; the ten that were ratified by the states
have been known ever since as the Bill of Rights. These
guaranteed freedom of religion, speech, the press, petition,
and assembly, as well as the right to bear arms, be protected against unreasonable searches and arrests, trial by
jury, due process of law, and the protection of property
rights. Many of these rights were derived from the natural
rights philosophy of the eighteenth-century philosophes,
which was popular among the American colonists. Many
European intellectuals saw the American Revolution as the
embodiment of the Enlightenment’s political dreams. And
when French officers who had fought in the American
War for Independence returned to France, they did so
with ideas of individual liberties and notions of republicanism and popular sovereignty that would soon play a
role in the early stages of the French Revolution.
Background to the
French Revolution
Q Focus Question: What were the long-range and
immediate causes of the French Revolution?
Although we associate events like the French Revolution
with sudden changes, such events involve long-range
problems as well as immediate precipitating forces. The
causes of the French Revolution must be sought in a multifaceted examination of French society and its problems in
the late eighteenth century.
Social Structure of the Old Regime
The long-range or indirect causes of the French Revolution must first be sought in the condition of French society. Before the Revolution, French society was grounded
in the idea of privilege or an inequality of rights. The
population of 27 million was divided, as it had been since
the Middle Ages, into legal categories known as the three
orders or estates.
The First Estate The First Estate consisted of the clergy
and numbered about 130,000 people. The church owned
approximately 10 percent of the land. Clergy were exempt
from the taille, France’s chief tax, although the church
had agreed to pay a ‘‘voluntary’’ contribution every five
years to the state. Clergy were also radically divided: the
higher clergy, stemming from aristocratic families, shared
the interests of the nobility, while the parish priests were
often poor commoners.
The Second Estate The Second Estate was the nobility,
composed of no more than 350,000 people who nevertheless owned perhaps 30 percent of the land. The nobility had continued to play an important and even
crucial role in French society in the eighteenth century,
holding many of the leading positions in the government,
the military, the law courts, and the higher church offices.
The French nobility was also divided. The ‘‘nobility of the
robe’’ derived its status from officeholding, a pathway that
had often enabled commoners to attain noble rank. These
nobles now dominated the royal law courts and important administrative offices. The ‘‘nobility of the sword’’
claimed to be descended from the original medieval nobility. As a group, the nobles sought to expand their
privileges at the expense of the monarchy---to defend
liberty by resisting the arbitrary actions of monarchy, as
some nobles asserted---and to maintain their monopolistic control over positions in the military, church, and
government. Moreover, the possession of privileges remained a hallmark of the nobility. Common to all nobles
were tax exemptions, especially from the taille.
The Third Estate The Third Estate, the commoners of
French society, constituted the overwhelming majority of
the population. They were divided by vast differences in
occupation, level of education, and wealth. The peasants,
who alone made up 75 to 80 percent of the total population, were by far the largest segment of the Third Estate.
They owned about 35 to 40 percent of the land, although
these holdings varied from area to area and more than
half the peasants had little or no land on which to support
themselves. Serfdom no longer existed on any large scale
in France, but French peasants still had obligations to
their local landlords that they deeply resented. These
‘‘relics of feudalism,’’ survivals from an earlier age, included the payment of fees for the use of village facilities,
such as the flour mill, community oven, and winepress, as
well as tithes to the clergy.
Another part of the Third Estate consisted of skilled
artisans, shopkeepers, and other wage earners in the cities. Although the eighteenth century had been a period of
rapid urban growth, 90 percent of French towns had
fewer than ten thousand inhabitants, and only nine cities
had more than fifty thousand. In the eighteenth century,
consumer prices rose faster than wages, with the result
that these urban groups experienced a decline in purchasing power. In Paris, for example, income lagged behind food prices and well behind a 140 percent rise in
rents for working people in skilled and unskilled trades.
The economic discontent of this segment of the Third
Estate---and often simply the struggle for survival---led the
common people to play an important role in the French
Revolution, especially in the city of Paris.
About 8 percent, or 2.3 million people, constituted
the bourgeoisie or middle class, who owned about 20 to
25 percent of the land. This group included merchants,
bankers, and industrialists who controlled the resources
of trade, finance, and manufacturing and benefited from
the economic prosperity after 1730. The bourgeoisie also
included professional people---lawyers, holders of public
offices, doctors, and writers. Many members of the
bourgeoisie sought security and status through the purchase of land. They had their own set of grievances because they were often excluded from the social and
political privileges monopolized by nobles. At the same
time, remarkable similarities existed at the upper levels of
society between the wealthier bourgeoisie and the nobility. It was still possible for wealthy middle-class individuals to enter the ranks of the nobility by obtaining
public offices and entering the nobility of the robe.
During this century, 6,500 new noble families were created in this way. Moreover, the new and critical ideas of
the Enlightenment proved attractive to aristocrats and
bourgeois alike. Members of both groups shared a common world of liberal political thought. Both aristocratic
and bourgeois elites, long accustomed to a new socioeconomic reality based on wealth and economic achievement, were increasingly frustrated by a monarchical
system resting on privileges and on an old and rigid social
order based on the concept of estates. The opposition of
these elites to the old order ultimately led them to take
drastic action against the monarchical regime, although
they soon split over the problem of how far to proceed in
eliminating traditional privileges. In a real sense, the Revolution had its origins in political grievances.
Other Problems Facing the French Monarchy
The inability of the French monarchy to deal with new
social realities was exacerbated by specific problems in the
1780s. Although France had enjoyed fifty years of growth
overall, periodic economic crises still occurred. Bad harvests in 1787 and 1788 and an incipient manufacturing
depression resulted in food shortages, rising prices for
food and other necessities, and unemployment in the
cities. The number of poor, estimated by some analysts at
almost one-third of the population, reached crisis proportions on the eve of the Revolution.
The immediate cause of the French Revolution was
the near collapse of government finances. In the midst of
the economic crisis, the government found itself drastically short of money. Yet governmental expenditures
continued to grow due to costly wars and royal extravagance. The government responded by borrowing; in the
budget of 1788, the interest on the debt constituted half
of government spending. Total debt had reached 4 billion
livres (roughly $800 million). Financial lenders, fearful
that they would never be repaid, were refusing to lend
additional amounts. On the verge of a complete financial
collapse, the government of Louis XVI was finally forced
to call a meeting of the Estates-General, the French parliamentary body that had not met since 1614.
The French Revolution
Q Focus Questions: What were the main events of the
French Revolution between 1789 and 1799? What role
in the Revolution did each of the following play:
lawyers, peasants, women, the clergy, the Jacobins, the
sans-culottes, the French Revolutionary Army, and the
Committee of Public Safety?
In summoning the Estates-General, the government was
merely looking for a way to solve the immediate financial
crisis. The monarchy had no wish for a major reform of
the government, nor did the delegates who arrived at
Versailles come with plans for the revolutionary changes
that ultimately emerged. Yet over the next years, through
the interplay of the deputies meeting in various legislative
assemblies, the common people in the streets of Paris and
other cities, and the peasants in the countryside, much of
the old regime would be destroyed, and Europe would
have a new model for political and social change.
From Estates-General to National Assembly
The Estates-General consisted of representatives from the
three orders of French society. In the elections for the
Estates-General, the government had ruled that the Third
Estate should get double representation (it did, after all,
constitute 97 percent of the population). Consequently,
while both the First Estate (the clergy) and the Second
Estate (the nobility) had about three hundred delegates
each, the commoners had almost six hundred representatives. Two-thirds of the latter were people with legal
training, and three-fourths were from towns with over
two thousand inhabitants, giving the Third Estate a particularly strong legal and urban representation. Most
members of the Third Estate advocated a regular constitutional government that would abolish the fiscal privileges of the church and nobility as the major way to
regenerate France.
The Estates-General opened at Versailles on May 5,
1789. It was divided from the start over the question of
whether voting should be by order or by head (one vote
per delegate). Traditionally, each order would vote separately; each would have veto power over the other two,
thus guaranteeing aristocratic control over reforms. But
the Third Estate was opposed to this approach and
pushed its demands for voting by head. Since it had
double representation, with the assistance of liberal nobles and clerics, it could turn the three estates into a
single-chamber legislature that would reform France in its
own way. Most delegates still desired to make changes
within a framework of respect for the authority of the
king; revival or reform did not mean the overthrow of
traditional institutions. But when the First Estate declared
in favor of voting by order, the Third Estate felt compelled
to respond in a significant fashion. On June 17, 1789, the
Third Estate voted to constitute itself a ‘‘national assembly’’ and decided to draw up a constitution. Three days
later, on June 20, the deputies of the Third Estate arrived
at their meeting place to find the door locked; thereupon
they moved to a nearby indoor tennis court and swore (in
what became known as the Tennis Court Oath) that they
would continue to meet until they had produced a French
constitution. These actions of June 17 and June 20 constitute the first step in the French Revolution, since the
Third Estate had no legal right to act as the National
Assembly. This bold move, largely the work of the lawyers
of the Third Estate, was soon in jeopardy, however, as the
king sided with the First Estate and threatened to dissolve
the Estates-General. Louis XVI now prepared to use force.
The common people, however, in a series of urban
and rural uprisings in the summer of 1789, saved the
Third Estate from the king’s attempt to stop the Revolution. The most famous of the urban risings was the fall
of the Bastille (see the box on p. 404). Parisians organized
a popular force and on July 14 attacked the Bastille, a
royal armory. But the Bastille had also been a state prison,
and though it now contained only seven prisoners (five
forgers and two insane people), its fall quickly became a
popular symbol of the common people’s triumph over
despotism. Paris was abandoned to the insurgents, and
Louis XVI was soon informed that the royal troops were
unreliable. Louis’s acceptance of that reality signaled the
collapse of royal authority; the king could no longer
enforce his will. The fall of the Bastille had saved the
National Assembly.
At the same time, independent of what was going on
in Paris, popular revolts broke out in numerous cities.
The collapse of royal authority in the cities was paralleled
by peasant insurrections in the countryside. A growing
resentment of the entire landholding system, with its fees
and obligations, created the conditions for a popular
uprising. The fall of the Bastille and the king’s apparent
capitulation to the demands of the Third Estate now
encouraged peasants to take matters into their own
hands. In July and August, peasant rebellions occurred
throughout France. The agrarian revolts served as a
backdrop to the Great Fear, a vast panic that spread
through the country like wildfire between July 20 and
August 6. Fear of invasion by foreign troops, aided by a
supposed aristocratic plot, encouraged the formation of
more citizens’ militias and committees. The greatest impact of the agrarian revolts and the Great Fear was on the
National Assembly meeting in Versailles.
Destruction of the Old Regime
One of the first acts of the National Assembly was to
destroy the relics of feudalism or aristocratic privileges.
On the night of August 4, 1789, the National Assembly in
an astonishing session voted to abolish seigneurial rights
as well as the fiscal privileges of nobles, clergy, towns, and
provinces. On August 26, the assembly provided the
ideological foundation for its actions and an educational
device for the nation by adopting the Declaration of the
Rights of Man and the Citizen (see the box on p. 405).
This charter of basic liberties began with a ringing affirmation of ‘‘the natural and imprescriptible [unalterable]
rights of man’’ to ‘‘liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression.’’ It went on to affirm the destruction
of aristocratic privileges by proclaiming an end to exemptions from taxation, freedom and equal rights for all
men, and access to public office based on talent. The
monarchy was restricted, and all citizens were to have the
right to take part in the legislative process. Freedom of
speech and the press were coupled with the outlawing of
arbitrary arrests.
The Declaration also raised another important issue.
Did the proclamation’s ideal of equal rights for all men
also include women? Many deputies insisted that it did, at
least in terms of civil liberties, provided that, as one said,
‘‘women do not aspire to exercise political rights and
functions.’’ Olympe de Gouges, a playwright and pamphleteer, refused to accept this exclusion of women
from political rights. Echoing the words of the official
declaration, she penned a Declaration of the Rights of
Woman and the Female Citizen, in which she insisted that
women should have all the same rights as men. The
National Assembly ignored her demands (see the box on
p. 405).
In the meantime, Louis XVI had remained inactive at
Versailles. He did refuse, however, to promulgate the
decrees on the abolition of feudalism and the Declaration
of Rights, but an unexpected turn of events soon forced
the king to change his mind. On October 5, thousands of
Parisian women, described by one eyewitness as ‘‘detachments of women coming up from every direction,
armed with broomsticks, lances, pitchforks, swords, pistols and muskets,’’ marched to Versailles, 12 miles away,
and insisted that the royal family return to Paris. On
October 6, the king complied. As a goodwill gesture, he
brought along wagonloads of flour from the palace stores.
All were escorted by women armed with pikes (some of
which held the severed heads of the king’s guards),
singing, ‘‘We are bringing back the baker, the baker’s wife,
and the baker’s boy’’ (the king, the queen, and their son).
The king now accepted the National Assembly’s decrees
and was virtually a prisoner in Paris.
Because the Catholic church was viewed as an important pillar of the old order, it soon felt the impact of
reform. Most of the lands of the church were confiscated,
and the church was also secularized. In July 1790, the
Civil Constitution of the Clergy was put into effect. Both
bishops and priests of the Catholic church were to be
elected by the people and paid by the state. All clergy were
also required to swear an oath of allegiance to the Civil
Constitution. Only 54 percent of the French parish clergy
took the oath, and the majority of bishops refused. The
Catholic church, still an important institution in the life
of the French people, now became an enemy of the
Revolution.
A New Constitution By 1791, the National Assembly
had completed a new constitution that established a
limited constitutional monarchy. There was still a monarch (now called ‘‘king of the French’’), but he enjoyed
few powers not subject to review by the new Legislative
Assembly. The Legislative Assembly, in which sovereign
power was vested, was to sit for two years and consist of
745 representatives chosen by an indirect system of
election that preserved power in the hands of the more
affluent members of society. Only active citizens (men
over the age of twenty-five paying taxes equivalent in
value to three days’ unskilled labor) could vote for electors (men paying taxes equal in value to ten days’ labor).
This relatively small group of fifty thousand electors then
chose the deputies. To qualify as a deputy, one had to pay
taxes equal in value to fifty-four days’ labor.
Opposition from Within By 1791, a revolutionary consensus that was largely the work of the wealthier members
of the bourgeoisie had moved France into a drastic reordering of the old regime. By mid-1791, however, this
consensus faced growing opposition from clerics angered
by the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, lower classes hurt
by a rise in the cost of living, peasants angry that dues had
still not been abandoned, and political clubs like the
Jacobins who offered more radical solutions to France’s
problems. In addition, by mid-1791, the government was
still facing severe financial difficulties due to massive tax
evasion. Despite all of their problems, however, the
bourgeois politicians in charge remained relatively unified
on the basis of their trust in the king. But Louis XVI
disastrously undercut them. Upset with the whole turn of
revolutionary events, he attempted to flee France in disguise in June 1791 and almost succeeded before being
recognized, captured, and brought back to Paris. In this
unsettled situation, with a discredited and seemingly
disloyal monarch, the new Legislative Assembly held its
first session in October 1791. France’s relations with the
rest of Europe soon led to Louis’s downfall.
Opposition from Abroad Over a period of time, some
Europeans had become concerned about the French example and feared that revolution would spread to their countries. On August 27, 1791, Emperor Leopold II of Austria
and King Frederick William II of Prussia invited other European monarchs to use force to reestablish monarchical
authority in France. Insulted by this threat, the Legislative
Assembly declared war on Austria on April 20, 1792.
The French fared badly in the initial fighting. A
French army invaded the Austrian Netherlands (Belgium)
but was routed, and Paris now feared invasion by the
Austrians and Prussians. Alarmed by the turn of events,
the Legislative Assembly called for twenty thousand national guardsmen from the provinces to come and defend
Paris. One such group came from Marseilles singing a
rousing war song, soon known as the ‘‘Marseillaise,’’ that
three years later was made the French national anthem:
Arise, children of the motherland.
The day of glory has arrived.
Against us, tyranny’s
Bloody flag is raised.
Don’t you hear in our countryside
The roar of their ferocious soldiers?
They are coming into your homes
To butcher your sons and your companions.
To arms, citizens! Form your battalions!
We march, we march!
Let their impure blood water our fields.
As fears of invasion grew, a frantic search for scapegoats began; as one observer noted, ‘‘Everywhere you hear
the cry that the king is betraying us, the generals are
betraying us, that nobody is to be trusted; . . . that Paris
will be taken in six weeks by the Austrians. . . . We are on
a volcano ready to spout flames.’’1 Defeats in war coupled
with economic shortages in the spring reinvigorated
popular groups that had been dormant since the previous
summer and led to renewed political demonstrations,
especially against the king. Radical Parisian political groups,
declaring themselves an insurrectionary ‘‘commune,’’
organized a mob attack on the royal palace and Legislative Assembly in August 1792, took the king captive,
and forced the assembly to suspend the monarchy and
call for a national convention, chosen on the basis of
universal male suffrage, to decide on the future form of
government. The French Revolution was about to enter a
more radical stage as power passed from the assembly to
the new Paris Commune, composed of many who
proudly called themselves the sans-culottes, ordinary
patriots without fine clothes (the name literally means
‘‘without knee-breeches,’’ the fashionable men’s attire
of the day). Although it has become customary to
equate the more radical sans-culottes with working
people or the poor, many were merchants and better-off
artisans who were often the elite of their neighborhoods.
The Radical Revolution
In September 1792, the newly elected National Convention began its sessions. Although it was called to draft a
new constitution, it also acted as the sovereign ruling body
of France. Socially, the composition of the National Convention was similar to its predecessors. Dominated by
lawyers, professionals, and property owners, two-thirds of
its deputies were under forty-five, and almost all had had
political experience as a result of the Revolution. Almost all
were also intensely distrustful of the king and his activities.
It was therefore no surprise that the Convention’s first
major step on September 21 was to abolish the monarchy
and establish a republic. At the beginning of 1793, the
National Convention found the king guilty of treason and
sentenced him to death. With Louis XVI’s execution on
January 21, 1793, the destruction of the old regime was
complete. There could be no turning back. But the dispatch of the king produced new challenges by creating new
enemies for the Revolution both at home and abroad while
strengthening groups that were already opposed to it.
In Paris, the local government, the Commune, led by
the newly appointed minister of justice, Georges Danton,
favored drastic change and put constant pressure on the
Convention, pushing it to ever more radical positions.
Moreover, the National Convention still did
not rule all of France. Peasants in the west
and inhabitants of France’s major provincial
cities refused to accept the authority of the
Convention. Domestic turmoil was paralleled by a foreign crisis. By the time the king
was executed, most of Europe---an informal
coalition of Austria, Prussia, Spain, Portugal,
Britain, the Dutch Republic, and Russia---
had aligned against France, and by late
spring, some members of the coalition were
poised to invade France in an effort to destroy the revolutionaries and reestablish the
old regime.
To meet these crises, the Convention
gave broad powers to an executive committee of twelve known as the Committee of
Public Safety, which came to be dominated
by Maximilien Robespierre, the leader of the
Jacobins. For a twelve-month period, this
committee gave the country the leadership it
needed to weather the domestic and foreign
crises of 1793.
A Nation in Arms To meet the foreign crisis
and save the republic from its foreign enemies, the Committee of Public Safety decreed a universal
mobilization of the nation on August 23, 1793:
Young men will fight, young men are called to conquer.
Married men will forge arms, transport military baggage and
guns and prepare food supplies. Women, who at long last are
to take their rightful place in the revolution and follow their
true destiny, will forget their futile tasks: their delicate hands
will work at making clothes for soldiers; they will make tents
and they will extend their tender care to shelters where the
defenders of the [nation] will receive the help that their
wounds require. Children will make lint of old cloth. It is for
them that we are fighting: children, those beings destined to
gather all the fruits of the revolution, will raise their pure
hands toward the skies. And old men, performing their missions again, as of yore, will be guided to the public squares
of the cities where they will kindle the courage of young
warriors and preach the doctrines of hate for kings and the
unity of the Republic.2
In less than a year, the French revolutionary government
had raised an army of 650,000; by September 1794, it
numbered 1,169,000. The Republic’s army---a nation in
arms---was the largest ever seen in European history. It
pushed the allies back across the Rhine and even conquered the Austrian Netherlands to the north (see
Map 19.1).
Historians have focused on the importance of the
French Revolutionary Army as an important step in the
creation of modern nationalism. Previously, wars had
been fought between governments or ruling dynasties by
relatively small armies of professional soldiers. The new
French army, however, was the creation of a ‘‘people’s’’
government; its wars were now ‘‘people’s’’ wars. The
entire nation was to be involved in the war. But when
dynastic wars became people’s wars, warfare increased in
ferocity and lack of restraint. Although innocent civilians
had suffered in the earlier struggles, now the carnage
became appalling at times. The wars of the French revolutionary era opened the door to the total war of the
modern world.
The Committee of Public Safety and the Reign of
Terror To meet the domestic crisis, the National Convention and the Committee of Public Safety established
the Reign of Terror. Revolutionary courts were organized
to protect the republic from its internal enemies (see the
box on p. 410). In the course of nine months, sixteen
thousand people were officially killed under the blade
of the guillotine, a revolutionary device for the quick and
efficient separation of heads from bodies. But the true
number of the Terror’s victims was probably closer to
fifty thousand. The bulk of the Terror’s executions took
place in places that had been in open rebellion against
the authority of the National Convention. The Terror
demonstrated no class prejudice. Estimates are that the
nobles constituted 8 percent of its victims; the middle
classes, 25 percent; the clergy, 6 percent; and the peasant
and laboring classes, 61 percent. To the Committee of
Public Safety, this bloodletting was only a temporary
expedient. After the wars and domestic emergencies were
over, there would arise a ‘‘republic of virtue’’ in which the
Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen would
be fully established.
Military force in the form of revolutionary armies
was used to bring recalcitrant cities and districts back
under the control of the National Convention. Because
Lyons was France’s second city after Paris and had defied
the National Convention during a time when the republic
was in peril, the Committee of Public Safety decided
to make an example of it. By April 1794, a total of
1,880 citizens of Lyons had been executed. When guillotining proved too slow, cannon fire and grapeshot were
used to blow condemned men into open graves. A German
observed:
Whole ranges of houses, always the most handsome, burnt.
The churches, convents, and all the dwellings of the former
patricians were in ruins. When I came to the guillotine, the
blood of those who had been executed a few hours beforehand was still running in the street. . . . I said to a group of
sans-culottes that it would be decent to clear away all this
human blood. Why should it be cleared? one of them said to
me. It’s the blood of aristocrats and rebels. The dogs should
lick it up.3
In western France, revolutionary armies were also brutal
in defeating the rebel armies. The commander of one
revolutionary army ordered that no quarter be given:
‘‘The road to Laval is strewn with corpses. Women,
priests, monks, children, all have been put to death. I have
spared nobody.’’ Perhaps the most notorious act of violence occurred in Nantes, where victims were executed by
sinking them in barges in the Loire River.
The ‘‘Republic of Virtue’’ Along with the Terror, the
Committee of Public Safety took other steps both to
control France and to create a new republican order and
new republican citizens. By spring 1793, it was sending
‘‘representatives on mission’’ as agents of the central
government to all parts of France to implement the laws
dealing with the wartime emergency. The committee also
attempted to provide some economic controls by the Law
of the General Maximum, which established price limits
on goods declared of first necessity, ranging from food
and drink to fuel and clothing. The controls failed to work
very well because the government lacked the machinery to
enforce it.
In its attempts to create a new order, the National
Convention also pursued a policy of de-Christianization.
A new calendar was instituted in which years would no
longer be numbered from the birth of Jesus but from
September 22, 1792, the first day of the French Republic.
The new calendar also eliminated Sundays and church
holidays. The word saint was removed from street names,
churches were pillaged and closed by revolutionary armies, and priests were encouraged to marry. In Paris, the
cathedral of Notre-Dame was designated a ‘‘temple of
reason’’; in November 1793, a public ceremony dedicated
to the worship of Reason was held in the former cathedral
in which patriotic maidens adorned in white dresses
paraded where the high altar had once stood.
Equality and Slavery Early in the French Revolution,
the desire for equality led to a discussion of what to do
about slavery. A club called Friends of the Blacks advocated the abolition of slavery, which was achieved in
France in September 1791. However, French planters in
the West Indies, who profited greatly from the use of
slaves on their sugar plantations, opposed the abolition of
slavery in the French colonies. When the National Convention came to power, the issue was revisited, and on
February 4, 1794, guided by ideals of equality, the government abolished slavery in the colonies.
In one French colony, slaves had already rebelled for
their freedom. In 1791, black slaves in the French sugar
colony of SaintDomingue (the western third of the island
of Hispaniola), inspired by the ideals
of the revolution occurring in France,
revolted against
French plantation
owners, killing the
owners and their
families and burning their buildings. White planters retaliated with equal brutality. One wealthy French settler
reported, ‘‘How can we stay in a country where slaves have
raised their hands against their masters?’’
Eventually, leadership of the revolt was taken over by
Toussaint L’Ouverture (1746--1803), the son of African
slaves, who seized control of all of Hispaniola by 1801.
Although Napoleon (see ‘‘The Age of Napoleon’’ later in
this chapter) had accepted the revolutionary ideal of
equality, he did not deny the reports that the massacres of
white planters by slaves demonstrated the savage nature
of blacks. In 1802, he reinstated slavery in the
French West Indian colonies and sent an army that
captured L’Ouverture, who died in a French
dungeon within a year. But the French soldiers,
weakened by disease, soon succumbed to the slave
forces. On January 1, 1804, the western part of
Hispaniola, now called Haiti, announced its freedom and became the first independent state in
Latin America. Despite Napoleon’s efforts to the
contrary, one of the French revolutionary ideals
had triumphed abroad.
The Decline of the Committee of Public Safety
Maintaining the revolutionary ideals in France,
however, proved not to be easy. By the summer of
1794, the French had been successful on the battlefield against their foreign foes. The military
successes meant that the Terror no longer served
much purpose. But the Terror continued because
Robespierre, now its dominant figure, had become
obsessed with purifying the body politic of all
corruption. Many deputies in the National Convention feared, however, that they were not safe while
Robespierre was free to act. An anti-Robespierre
coalition in the National Convention gathered
enough votes to condemn him. Robespierre was
guillotined on July 28, 1794, beginning a reaction
that brought an end to this radical stage of the French
Revolution.
The National Convention and its Committee of
Public Safety had accomplished a great deal. By creating a
nation in arms, they preserved the French Revolution and
prevented it from being destroyed by its foreign enemies,
who, if they had succeeded, would have reestablished the
old monarchical order. Domestically, the Revolution had
also been saved from the forces of counterrevolution. The
committee’s tactics, however, provided an example for the
use of violence in domestic politics that has continued to
bedevil the Western world to this day.
Reaction and the Directory
After the execution of Robespierre, revolutionary fervor
began to give way to the Thermidorean Reaction, named
after the month of Thermidor on the new French calendar.
The Terror began to abate. The National Convention
curtailed the power of the Committee of Public Safety, shut
down the Jacobin club, and attempted to provide better
protection for its deputies against the Parisian mobs.
Churches were allowed to reopen for public worship.
Economic regulation was dropped in favor of laissez-faire
policies, another clear indication that moderate forces were
again gaining control of the Revolution. In addition, a new
constitution was adopted in August 1795 that reflected this
more conservative republicanism and a desire for a stability
that did not sacrifice the ideals of 1789.
To avoid the dangers of another single legislative
assembly, the Constitution of 1795 established a national
legislative assembly consisting of two chambers: a lower
house, known as the Council of 500, which initiated
legislation, and an upper house, the Council of Elders,
which accepted or rejected the proposed laws. The 750
members of the two legislative bodies were chosen by
electors who had to be owners or renters of property
worth between 100 and 200 days’ labor, a requirement
that limited their number to thirty thousand. The
Council of Elders elected five directors from a list presented by the Council of 500 to act as the executive
committee, known as the Directory.
The period of the Directory was an era of materialistic reaction to the suffering and sacrifices that had been
demanded in the Reign of Terror and the Republic of
Virtue. Speculators made fortunes in property by taking
advantage of the government’s severe monetary problems.
Elaborate fashions, which had gone out of style because of
their identification with the nobility, were worn again.
Gambling and roulette became popular once more.
Groups of ‘‘gilded youth’’---the sons of the wealthy, with
long hair and rumpled clothes---took to the streets to
insult former supporters of the Revolution.
The government of the Directory had to contend with
political enemies from both ends of the political spectrum.
On the right, royalists who dreamed of restoring the
monarchy continued their agitation. On the left, Jacobin
hopes of power were revived by continuing economic
problems. Battered by the left and right, unable to find a
definitive solution to the country’s economic problems,
and still carrying on the wars inherited from the Committee of Public Safety, the Directory increasingly relied
on the military to maintain its power. This led to a coup
d’e´tat in 1799 in which the successful and popular military
general Napoleon Bonaparte was able to seize power.
The Age of Napoleon
Q Focus Question: Which aspects of the French
Revolution did Napoleon preserve, and which did
he destroy?
Napoleon dominated the history of both France and the
rest of Europe from 1799 to 1815. In a sense, Napoleon
brought the Revolution to an end, but he was also its
product; he even called himself the ‘‘Son of the Revolution.’’
The French Revolution had made possible his rise first in
the military and then to supreme power in France. Even
beyond this, Napoleon had once said, ‘‘I am the Revolution,’’ and he never ceased to remind the French that they
owed to him the preservation of all that was beneficial in
the revolutionary program.
The Rise of Napoleon
Napoleon Bonaparte was born in 1769 in Corsica, a few
months after France had annexed the island. The son of a
lawyer whose family stemmed from the Florentine nobility, the young Napoleon obtained a royal scholarship to
study at a military school in France. When the Revolution
broke out in 1789, Napoleon was a lieutenant, but the
Revolution and the European war that followed broadened his sights and presented him with new opportunities.
Napoleon rose quickly through the ranks. In 1794, when
he was only twenty-five, the Committee of Public Safety
promoted him to the rank of brigadier general. Two years
later, he was made commander of the French armies in Italy
(see the box on p. 413), where he won a series of stunning
victories and dictated peace to the Austrians in 1797.
Throughout his Italian campaigns, Napoleon won the confidence of his men by his energy, charm, and ability to
comprehend complex issues quickly
and make decisions rapidly. These
qualities, combined with his keen
intelligence, ease with words, and
supreme confidence in himself, enabled him throughout the rest of his
life to influence people and win their
firm support. Napoleon liked to see
himself as a man of destiny and a
great man who mastered luck. Napoleon also saw himself as a military
genius who had a ‘‘touch for leading,
which could not be learned from
books, nor by practice.’’
In 1797, Napoleon returned
to France as a conquering hero.
Despite a disastrous expedition to
Egypt in 1799, Napoleon returned
to Paris, where he participated in
the coup d’e´tat that ultimately led
to his virtual dictatorship of
France. He was only thirty years
old at the time.
With the coup of 1799, a new
form of the republic was proclaimed
in which, as first consul, Napoleon
directly controlled the entire executive authority of government.
He had overwhelming influence over the legislature, appointed members of the administrative bureaucracy,
controlled the army, and conducted foreign affairs. In
1802, Napoleon was made consul for life and in 1804
returned France to monarchy when he crowned himself
Emperor Napoleon I. The revolutionary era that had begun
with an attempt to limit arbitrary government had ended
with a government far more autocratic than the monarchy of the old regime.
The Domestic Policies of Emperor Napoleon
Napoleon once claimed that he had preserved the gains of
the Revolution for the French people. The ideal of republican liberty had, of course, been destroyed by Napoleon’s thinly disguised autocracy. But were revolutionary
ideals maintained in other ways? An examination of his
domestic policies will enable us to judge the accuracy of
Napoleon’s assertion.
Napoleon and the Catholic Church In 1801, Napoleon
established peace with the oldest and most implacable
enemy of the Revolution, the Catholic church. Both sides
gained from the Concordat that Napoleon arranged with
the pope. Napoleon agreed to recognize Catholicism as the
religion of a majority of the French people. Although
the Catholic church was permitted to hold processions
again and reopen the seminaries, the pope agreed not to
raise the question of the church lands confiscated in the
Revolution. As a result of the Concordat, the Catholic
church was no longer an enemy of the French government. At the same time, the agreement reassured those
who had acquired church lands during the Revolution
that they would not be stripped of them, an assurance
that obviously made them supporters of the Napoleonic
regime.
A New Code of Laws Napoleon’s most famous domestic achievement was his codification of the laws.
Before the Revolution, France did not have a single set of
laws but rather a conglomeration of three hundred legal
systems. During the Revolution, efforts were made to
codify the laws for the entire nation, but it remained for
Napoleon to oversee the project and bring the work to
completion in seven codes, of which the most important
was the Civil Code (or Code Napole´on). This preserved
most of the revolutionary gains by recognizing the
principle of the equality of all citizens before the law,
the right of the individual to choose a profession, religious toleration, and the abolition of serfdom and
feudalism. Property rights continued to be carefully
protected, and the interests of employers were safeguarded
by outlawing trade unions and strikes. The Civil Code
clearly reflected the revolutionary aspirations for a uniform
legal system, legal equality, and protection of property and
individuals.
But the rights of some people were strictly curtailed
by the Civil Code. During the radical phase of the
French Revolution, new laws had made divorce an easy
process for both husbands and wives, restricted the
rights of fathers over their children (they could no
longer have their children put in prison arbitrarily), and
allowed all children (including daughters) to inherit
property equally. Napoleon’s Civil Code undid most of
this legislation. Fathers’ control over their families was
restored. Divorce was still allowed but was made more
difficult for women to obtain. A wife caught in adultery,
for example, could be divorced by her husband and
even imprisoned. A husband, however, could be accused
of adultery only if he moved his mistress into his home.
Women were now ‘‘less equal than men’’ in other ways
as well. When they married, their property passed into
the control of their husbands. In lawsuits, they were
treated as minors, and their testimony was regarded as
less reliable than that of men.
The French Bureaucracy Napoleon also worked on
rationalizing the bureaucratic structure of France by
developing a powerful, centralized administrative machine. Administrative centralization required a bureaucracy of capable officials, and Napoleon worked
hard to develop one. Early on, the regime showed its
preference for experts and cared little whether that expertise had been acquired in royal or revolutionary
bureaucracies. Promotion, in civil as well as military
offices, was to be based not on rank or birth but on
demonstrated abilities. This was, of course, what many
bourgeois had wanted before the Revolution. Napoleon,
however, also created a new aristocracy based on merit in
the state service. Napoleon elevated 3,263 individuals to
the nobility between 1808 and 1814; nearly 60 percent
were military officers; the remainder came from the upper
ranks of the civil service and other state and local officials.
Socially, only 22 percent of Napoleon’s aristocracy came
from the nobility of the old regime; almost 60 percent
were bourgeois in origin.
Napoleon’s Growing Despotism In his domestic policies, then, Napoleon both destroyed and retained aspects of the Revolution. Although equality was
preserved in the law code and in the opening of careers
to talent, the creation of a new aristocracy, the strong
protection accorded to property rights, and the use of
conscription for the military make it clear that much
equality had been lost. Liberty had been replaced by an
initially benevolent despotism that grew increasingly
arbitrary. Napoleon shut down sixty of France’s seventythree newspapers and insisted that all manuscripts be
subjected to government scrutiny before they were
published. Even the mail was opened by government
police.
One prominent writer, Germaine de Stael (1766--
1817), refused to accept Napoleon’s growing despotism.
Educated in Enlightenment ideas, she set up a salon in
Paris that was a prominent intellectual center by 1800.
She wrote novels and political works that denounced
Napoleon’s rule as tyrannical. Napoleon banned her
books in France and exiled her to the German states,
where she continued to write, although not without
considerable homesickness for France. ‘‘The universe is
in France,’’ she once wrote; ‘‘outside it there is nothing.’’
After the overthrow of Napoleon, Germaine de Stael
returned to her beloved Paris, where she died two years
later.
Napoleon’s Empire and the European Response
When Napoleon became first consul in 1799, France
was at war with a second European coalition of Russia,
Great Britain, and Austria. Napoleon realized the need
for a pause and achieved a peace treaty in 1802 that left
France with new frontiers and a number of client territories from the North Sea to the Adriatic. But the
peace did not last because the British and French both
regarded it as temporary and had little intention of
adhering to its terms.
In 1803, war was renewed with Britain, which was
soon joined by Austria and Russia in the Third Coalition. At the Battle of Ulm in southern Germany in 1805,
Napoleon crushed an Austrian army of fifty thousand
men. Proceeding eastward from Ulm, Napoleon attacked
Austrian and Russian forces gathered at Austerlitz and
devastated the combined armies. Austria sued for peace,
and Tsar Alexander I took his remaining forces back to
Russia.
At first, Prussia had refused to join the Third Coalition, but after Napoleon began to reorganize the German
states, Prussia reversed course. Acting quickly, Napoleon
crushed Prussian forces in two battles, at Jena and
Auerstadt, in October 1806 and then moved on to defeat
the Russians, who had decided to reenter the fray, at
Eylau and Friedland in June 1807. Napoleon’s Grand
Army had defeated the Continental members of the coalition, giving him the opportunity to establish a new
European order.
Napoleon’s Grand Empire The Grand Empire was composed of three major parts: the French empire, dependent
states, and allied states (see Map 19.2). The French empire, the inner core of the Grand Empire, consisted of an
enlarged France extending to the Rhine in the east and
including the western half of Italy north of Rome. Dependent states were kingdoms under the rule of Napoleon’s
relatives; these included Spain, the United Provinces of
the Netherlands, the kingdom of Italy, the Swiss Republic,
the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, and the Confederation
of the Rhine, which was a union of all the German states
except Austria and Prussia. Allied states were those defeated by Napoleon and forced to join his struggle against
Britain; they included Prussia, Austria, and Russia. Although the structure of the Grand Empire varied outside
its inner core, Napoleon considered himself the leader of
the whole.
Within his empire, Napoleon sought acceptance everywhere of certain revolutionary principles, including
legal equality, religious toleration, and economic freedom. As he explained to his brother Jerome after naming
him king of the new German state of Westphalia:
What the peoples of Germany desire most impatiently is
that talented commoners should have the same right to your
esteem and to public employments as the nobles, that any
trace of serfdom and of an intermediate hierarchy between
the sovereign and the lowest class of the people should be
completely abolished. The benefits of the Code Napole´on, the
publicity of judicial procedure, the creation of juries must be
so many distinguishing marks of your monarchy. . . . What
nation would wish to return under the arbitrary Prussian
government once it had tasted the benefits of a wise and
liberal administration? The peoples of Germany, the peoples
of France, of Italy, of Spain all desire equality and liberal
ideas. I have guided the affairs of Europe for many years
now, and I have had occasion to convince myself that the
buzzing of the privileged classes is contrary to the general
opinion. Be a constitutional king.4
In the inner core and dependent states of his Grand
Empire, Napoleon tried to destroy the old order. Nobility
and clergy everywhere in these states lost their special
privileges. He decreed equality of opportunity with offices
open to talent, equality before the law, and religious
toleration. This spread of French revolutionary principles
was an important factor in the development of liberal
traditions in these countries.
The Problem of Great Britain Like Hitler 130 years
later, Napoleon hoped that his Grand Empire would last
for centuries; like Hitler’s empire, it collapsed almost as
rapidly as it had been formed. Two major reasons help
explain this: the survival of Great Britain and the force of
nationalism. Britain’s survival was due primarily to its sea
power. As long as Britain ruled the waves, it was almost
invulnerable to military attack. Although Napoleon
contemplated an invasion of Britain and even collected
ships for it, he could not overcome the British navy’s
decisive defeat of a combined French-Spanish fleet at
Trafalgar in 1805. Napoleon then turned to his Continental System to defeat Britain. Put into effect between
1806 and 1808, it attempted to prevent British goods
from reaching the European continent in order to weaken
Britain economically and destroy its capacity to wage war.
But the Continental System failed. Allied states resented
the ever-tightening French economic hegemony; some
began to cheat and others to resist, thereby opening the
door to British collaboration. New markets in the Levant
(Middle East) and in Latin America also provided compensation for the British. Indeed, in 1809 and 1810,
British overseas exports reached near-record highs.
Nationalism The second important factor in the failure
of Napoleon was nationalism. This political creed had
arisen during the French Revolution in the French people’s emphasis on brotherhood (fraternite´) and solidarity
against other peoples. Nationalism involved the unique
cultural identity of a people based on common language,
religion, and national symbols. The spirit of French nationalism had made possible the mass armies of the
revolutionary and Napoleonic eras. But Napoleon’s extending of the principles of the French Revolution beyond
France inadvertently spread nationalism as well. The French
aroused nationalism in two ways: by making themselves
hated oppressors, and thus arousing the patriotism of
others in opposition to French nationalism, and by
showing the people of Europe what nationalism was and
what a nation in arms could do. The lesson was not lost
on other peoples and rulers. A Spanish uprising against
Napoleon’s rule, aided by British support, kept a French
force of 200,000 pinned down for years.
Nationalist movements also arose in the German
states, where a number of intellectuals advocated a cultural nationalism based on the unity of the German
people. In Prussia, feeling against Napoleon led to a serious reform of the old order that had been so easily
crushed by the French emperor. As one Prussian official
argued, the Prussians must learn from the French example and ‘‘place their entire national energies in opposition to the enemy.’’ Under the direction of Baron Stein
and later Prince Hardenberg, Prussia embarked on a series of political and military reforms, including the abolition of serfdom, election of city councils, and creation of
a larger standing army. As a response to Napoleon,
Prussia’s reforms enabled it to again play an important
role in European affairs.
The Fall of Napoleon Napoleon once said, ‘‘If I had
experienced pleasure, I might have rested; but the peril
was always in front of me, and the day’s victory was always forgotten in the preoccupation with the necessity of
winning a new victory on the
morrow.’’5 Never at rest, Napoleon
decided in 1812 to invade Russia.
It was the beginning of his downfall.
Russia’s defection from the
Continental System left Napoleon
with little choice. Although aware
of the risks of invading such a
large country, he also knew that if
the Russians were allowed to
challenge the Continental System
unopposed, others would soon
follow suit. In June 1812, a Grand
Army of more than 600,000 men
entered Russia. Napoleon’s hopes
for victory depended on quickly
meeting and defeating the Russian
armies, but the Russian forces refused to give battle and retreated
across hundreds of miles while
torching their own villages and
countryside to prevent Napoleon’s
army from finding food and shelter. When the Russians did stop to
fight at Borodino, Napoleon’s
forces won an indecisive and costly
victory. When the remaining
troops of the Grand Army arrived
in Moscow, they found the city ablaze. Lacking food and
supplies, Napoleon abandoned Moscow late in October
and made the ‘‘Great Retreat’’ across Russia in terrible
winter conditions. Only one-fifth of the original army
managed to straggle back to Poland in January 1813. This
military disaster then led to a war of liberation all over
Europe, culminating in Napoleon’s defeat in April 1814.
The vanquished emperor of the French was allowed
to play ruler on the island of Elba, off the coast of Tuscany,
while the Bourbon monarchy was restored to France in
the person of Louis XVIII, brother of the executed king.
But the new king had little support, and Napoleon, bored
on Elba, slipped back into France. When troops were sent
to capture him, Napoleon opened his coat and addressed
them: ‘‘Soldiers of the fifth regiment, I am your
Emperor. . . . If there is a man among you would kill his
Emperor, here I am!’’ No one fired a shot. Shouting ‘‘Vive
l’Empereur! Vive l’Empereur,’’ the troops went over to his
side, and Napoleon entered Paris in triumph on March
20, 1815.
The powers who had defeated him pledged once
more to fight this person, whom they called the ‘‘enemy
and disturber of the tranquillity of the world.’’ Having
decided to strike first at his enemies, Napoleon raised yet
another army and moved to attack the nearest allied
forces stationed in Belgium. At Waterloo on June 18,
Napoleon met a combined English and Prussian army
under the duke of Wellington and suffered a bloody defeat. This time the victorious Allies exiled him to Saint
Helena, a small and forsaken island in the South Atlantic,
where he died in 1821. Only Napoleon’s memory would
continue to haunt French political life.

CONCLUSION
The late eighteenth century was a time of dramatic political
transformation. Revolutionary upheavals, beginning in North
America and continuing in France, produced movements for
political liberty and equality. The documents promulgated by these
revolutions, the Declaration of Independence and the Declaration
of the Rights of Man and the Citizen, embodied the fundamental
ideas of the Enlightenment and set forth a liberal political agenda
based on a belief in popular sovereignty---the people as the source of
political power---and the principles of liberty and equality. Liberty,
frequently limited in practice, meant, in theory, freedom from
arbitrary power as well as the freedom to think, write, and worship
as one chose. Equality meant equality in rights and equality of
opportunity based on talent rather than birth. In practice, equality
remained limited; those who owned property had greater
opportunities for voting and officeholding, and there was no
equality between men and women.
The French Revolution established a modern revolutionary
concept. No one had foreseen or consciously planned the upheaval
that began in 1789, but thereafter revolutionaries knew that the
proper mobilization of the masses could succeed in overthrowing
unwanted governments. For these people, the French Revolution
became a symbol of hope; for those who feared such changes,
it became a symbol of dread. The French Revolution became the
classical political and social model for revolution. At the same time,
the liberal and national political ideals fostered by the Revolution
and spread through Europe by Napoleon dominated the political
landscape of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. A new
European era had begun.
