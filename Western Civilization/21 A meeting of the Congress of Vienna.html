<h2 id="org3ca83cf">21 A meeting of the Congress of Vienna</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3ca83cf">
<p class="verse">
In September 1814,<br />
&#xa0;hundreds of foreigners began to converge on Vienna, the capital city of the Austrian Empire.<br />
Many were members of European royalty&#x2014;kings, princes, archdukes, and their wives&#x2014;<br />
&#xa0;accompanied by their diplomatic advisers and scores of servants.<br />
Their congenial host was the Austrian emperor Francis I,<br />
&#xa0;who never tired of regaling Vienna's guests with concerts,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;glittering balls, sumptuous feasts, and hunting parties.<br />
One participant remembered, 'Eating, fireworks, public illuminations.<br />
For eight or ten days, I haven't been able to work at all. What a life!'<br />
Of course, not every waking hour was spent in pleasure during this gathering of notables,<br />
&#xa0;known to history as the Congress of Vienna.<br />
These people were also representatives of all the states that had fought Napoleon,<br />
&#xa0;and their real business was to arrange a final peace settlement after almost a decade of war.<br />
On June 8, 1815, they completed their task.<br />
<br />
The forces of upheaval unleashed during the French revolutionary and Napoleonic wars<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;were temporarily quieted in 1815<br />
&#xa0;as rulers sought to restore stability<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;by reestablishing much of the old order to a Europe weary of war.<br />
Kings, landed aristocrats, and bureaucratic elites regained their control over domestic governments,<br />
&#xa0;while internationally the forces of conservatism tried to maintain the new status quo;<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;some states even used military force<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;to intervene in the internal affairs of other countries in their desire to crush revolutions.<br />
<br />
But the Western world had been changed, and it would not readily go back to the old system.<br />
New ideologies, especially liberalism and nationalism,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;both products of the revolutionary upheaval initiated in France,<br />
&#xa0;had become too powerful to be contained.<br />
Not content with the status quo,<br />
&#xa0;the forces of change gave rise first to the revolts and revolutions<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;that periodically shook Europe in the 1820s and 1830s<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and then to the widespread revolutions of 1848.<br />
Some of the revolutions and revolutionaries were successful; most were not.<br />
Although the old order usually appeared to have prevailed,<br />
&#xa0;by 1850 it was apparent that its days were numbered.<br />
This perception was reinforced by the changes wrought by the Industrial Revolution.<br />
Together the forces unleashed by the French Revolution and the Industrial Revolution<br />
&#xa0;made it impossible to turn back.<br />
Nevertheless,<br />
&#xa0;although these two revolutions initiated what historians like to call the modern European world,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;remnants of the old persisted in the midst of the new.<br />
