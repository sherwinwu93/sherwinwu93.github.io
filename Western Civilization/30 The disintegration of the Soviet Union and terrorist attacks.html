<h2 id="org03bd951">30 The disintegration of the Soviet Union and terrorist attacks</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org03bd951">
<p class="verse">
By 1985, after four decades of the Cold War,<br />
&#xa0;Westerners had become accustomed to a division of Europe between West and East<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that seemed to be permanent.<br />
A prosperous Western Europe allied with the United States<br />
&#xa0;stood opposed to a still-struggling Eastern Europe<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that remained largely subject to the Soviet Union.<br />
The division of Germany symbolized the new and seemingly well-established order.<br />
Yet in just a few years,<br />
&#xa0;a revolutionary upheaval in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;brought an end to the Cold War and to the division of postwar Europe.<br />
Even the Soviet Union ceased to exist as a nation.<br />
And much of this can be traced to the reform efforts of one man, Mikhail Gorbachev.<br />
<br />
On August 19, 1991,<br />
&#xa0;a group of Soviet leaders opposed to reform arrested Gorbachev, the president of the Soviet Union,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and tried to seize control of the government.<br />
Spontaneously, hundreds of thousands of Russians, led by Boris Yeltsin,<br />
&#xa0;poured into the streets of Moscow and Leningrad to protest the attempted coup.<br />
Some army units, sent out to enforce the wishes of the upstart leaders,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;defected to Yeltsin’s side,<br />
&#xa0;and within days, the usurpers were forced to surrender.<br />
This failed attempt to seize power had unexpected results<br />
&#xa0;as Russia and many of the other Soviet republics turned their backs on the government<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and declared their independence.<br />
By the end of 1991, the Soviet Union&#x2014;one of the largest empires in world history&#x2014;<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;had come to an astonishingly swift end,<br />
&#xa0;and a new era of cooperation<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;between the successor states of the old Soviet Union and the nations of the West had begun.<br />
<br />
As the world adjusted to the transformation from Cold War to post&#x2013;Cold War sensibilities,<br />
&#xa0;other changes shaped the Western outlook.<br />
The demographic face of European countries changed<br />
&#xa0;as massive numbers of immigrants created more ethnically diverse populations.<br />
New artistic and intellectual currents, the continued advance of science and technology,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;the emergence of the Digital Age, the surge of the women’s liberation movement&#x2014;<br />
&#xa0;all spoke of a vibrant, ever-changing world.<br />
At the same time, a devastating terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in New York City<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and the Pentagon outside Washington, D.C., in 2001<br />
&#xa0;made the Western world vividly aware of its vulnerability to international terrorism.<br />
But most important of all,<br />
&#xa0;Western nations, like all nations on the planet,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;had become acutely aware of the political and economic interdependence of the world's nations<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;and the global nature of the challenges of the twenty-first century.<br />
