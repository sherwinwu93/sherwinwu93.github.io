<h2 id="org805727d">10 A medieval abbot and his monks</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org805727d">
<p class="verse">
The recovery and growth of European civilization in the High Middle Ages<br />
&#xa0;also affected the state and the church.<br />
Both lords and vassals and the Catholic church<br />
&#xa0;recovered from the invasions and internal dissension of the Early Middle Ages.<br />
Although lords and vassals seemed forever mired in endless petty conflicts,<br />
&#xa0;some medieval kings began to exert a centralizing authority<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and inaugurated the process of developing new kinds of monarchical states.<br />
By the thirteenth century,<br />
&#xa0;European monarchs were solidifying their governmental institutions in pursuit of greater power.<br />
<br />
The recovery of the Catholic church produced a reform movement<br />
&#xa0;that led to exalted claims of papal authority.<br />
This increase in church power, coupled with the rise of monarchical states,<br />
&#xa0;made it almost inevitable that there would be conflicts between church and state.<br />
At the same time,<br />
&#xa0;vigorous papal leadership combined with new dimensions of religious life<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;to make the Catholic church a forceful presence in every area of life.<br />
The role of the church in the new European civilization<br />
&#xa0;was quite evident in the career of a man named Samson,<br />
&#xa0;who became abbot or head of the great English abbey of Bury Saint Edmonds in 1182.<br />
According to Jocelyn of Brakeland, a monk who assisted him,<br />
&#xa0;Abbot Samson was a devout man who wore undergarments of horsehair and a horsehair shirt.<br />
He loved virtue and abhorred liars, drunkards and talkative folk.<br />
His primary concern was the spiritual well-being of his monastery,<br />
&#xa0;but he spent much of his time working on problems in the world beyond the abbey walls.<br />
Since the monastery had fallen into debt under his predecessors,<br />
&#xa0;Abbot Samson toiled tirelessly to recoup the abbey's fortunes by carefully supervising its manors.<br />
He also rounded up murderers to stand trial in Saint Edmunds<br />
&#xa0;and provided knights for the king's army.<br />
But his actions were not always tolerant or beneficial.<br />
He was instrumental in driving the Jews from the town of Saint Edmunds<br />
&#xa0;and was not above improving the abbey's possessions at the expense of his neighbors:<br />
He built up the bank of the fish-pond at Babwell so high,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;for the service of a new mill,<br />
&#xa0;that by the keeping back the water<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;there is not a man, rich or poor, but has lost his garden and his orchards.<br />
The abbot's worldly cares weighed heavily on him,<br />
&#xa0;but he had little choice<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;if his abbey were to flourish and fulfill its spiritual and secular functions.<br />
But he did have regrets; as he remarked to Jocelyn:<br />
&#xa0;If he could have returned to the circumstances he had enjoyed before he became a monk,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;he would never have become a monk or an abbot.<br />

<p>
Because of the development and growth in the High Middle Ages,<br />
	by the thirteenth century,<br />
	monarchs began to exert a centralizing authority<br />
			and inaugurated the process of new monarchical states<br />
		so that they solidified their governmental institutions to pursue greater power.<br />
</p>

<p>
At the same time,<br />
	the papal leadership combined with new dimensions of religious life<br />
		to make the church a vigorous presence in every area of life.<br />
The increase in the Church power, coupled with the rise of monarchical states,<br />
	made it inevitable that there would be conflicts between church and state.<br />
Samson, an abbot in England,<br />
	was a devout man who loved virtues and abhorred liars, drunkards, and talkative folks.<br />
Although his primary concern is the well-being of his monastery,<br />
	he had to spend more time working beyond the abbey walls<br />
		because the monastery had fallen into debt under his predecessors.<br />
He rounded up murders to stand trials and provided knights for the king's army.<br />
However, he also played an important role in driving the Jews from his town<br />
	and built up the bank of his fish pond to make others lose their gardens and orchards.<br />
He regretted that if he had a chance, he would have never become an abbot.<br />
