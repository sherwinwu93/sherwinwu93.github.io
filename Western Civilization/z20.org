THE FRENCH REVOLUTION dramatically altered the political
structure of France; the Napoleonic conquests then spread many of
the revolutionary principles to other parts of Europe. At the same
time, during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, another revolution---an industrial one---was transforming the economic
and social structure of Europe, although somewhat less radically
and rapidly.
The Industrial Revolution initiated a quantum leap in industrial production. New sources of energy and power, especially coal
and steam, replaced wind and water to run laborsaving machines
that dramatically decreased the use of human and animal muscle
power and at the same time increased productivity. This, in turn,
called for new ways of organizing human labor to maximize the
benefits and profits from the new machines as factories replaced
artisanal workshops and the cottage industry. Many early factories
were dreadful places with difficult working conditions. Reformers,
appalled at these conditions, were especially critical of the treatment of married women. One reported, ‘‘We have repeatedly seen
married females, in the last stage of pregnancy, slaving from morning to night beside these never-tiring machines, and when . . . they
were obliged to sit down to take a moment’s ease, and being seen
by the manager, were fined for the offense.’’ But some factories
were well run. William Cobbett described one in Manchester in
1830: ‘‘In this room, which is lighted in the most convenient and
beautiful manner, there were five hundred pairs of looms at work,
and five hundred persons attending those looms; and, owing to
the goodness of the masters, the whole looking healthy and welldressed.’’
During the Industrial Revolution, Europe experienced a shift
from a traditional, labor-intensive economy based on farming
and handicrafts to a more capital-intensive economy based on
manufacturing by machines, specialized labor, and industrial factories. Although the Industrial Revolution took decades to spread, it
was truly revolutionary in the way it fundamentally changed
Europeans, their society, and their relationship to other peoples.
The development of large factories encouraged mass movements of
people from the countryside to urban areas where impersonal coexistence replaced the traditional intimacy of rural life. Higher levels
of productivity led to a search for new sources of raw materials,
new consumption patterns, and a revolution in transportation that
allowed raw materials and finished products to be moved quickly
around the world. The rise of a wealthy industrial middle class and
a huge industrial working class (or proletariat) substantially transformed traditional social relationships.
The Industrial Revolution
in Great Britain
Q Focus Questions: Why did the Industrial Revolution
occur first in Great Britain, and why did it happen
when it did? What were the basic features of the new
industrial system it ushered in?
Historians generally agree that the Industrial Revolution
began in Britain in the second half of the eighteenth
century. By 1850, industry had made Great Britain the
wealthiest country in the world, and the revolution had
spread to the European continent and the New World.
Origins of the Industrial Revolution
A number of factors or conditions came together in
Britain to produce the Industrial Revolution. One of these
was the agricultural revolution of the eighteenth century,
which led to a significant increase in food production.
British agriculture could now feed more people at lower
prices with less labor; even ordinary British families did
not have to use most of their income to buy food, giving
them the potential to purchase manufactured goods. At
the same time, a rapid growth of population in the second half of the eighteenth century provided a substantial
pool of labor for the new factories of the emerging British
industry.
Britain had a ready supply of capital for investment
in the new industrial machines and the factories that were
needed to house them. In addition to profits from trade
and the cottage industry, Britain had an effective central
bank and well-developed, flexible credit facilities. Many
early factory owners were merchants and entrepreneurs
who had profited from the eighteenth-century cottage
industry. But capital is only part of the story; Britain had
a fair number of individuals who were interested in
making profits if the opportunity presented itself (see the
box on p. 423). The British were a people, as one historian
has said, ‘‘fascinated by wealth and commerce, collectively
and individually.’’ Undoubtedly, the English revolutions
of the seventeenth century had helped create an environment in Britain, unlike that of the absolutist states on
the Continent, where political power rested in the hands
of a progressive group of people who favored innovation
in economic matters.
Britain was richly supplied with the important mineral resources, such as coal and iron ore, needed in the
manufacturing process. Britain was also a small country,
and the relatively short distances made transportation
unproblematic. In addition to nature’s provision of
abundant rivers, from the mid-seventeenth century onward, both private and public investment poured into the
construction of new roads, bridges, and waterways. By
1780, roads, rivers, and canals linked the major industrial
centers of the North, the Midlands, London, and the
Atlantic.
Finally, a supply of markets gave British industrialists
a ready outlet for their manufactured goods. British exports quadrupled from 1660 to 1760. In the course of its
eighteenth-century wars and conquests, Great Britain had
developed a vast colonial empire at the expense of its
leading Continental rivals, the Dutch Republic and
France. Britain also possessed a well-developed merchant
marine that was able to transport goods to any place in
the world. A crucial factor in Britain’s successful industrialization was the ability to cheaply produce the articles
that were most in demand abroad. And the best markets
abroad were not in Europe, where countries protected
their own incipient industries, but in the Americas, Africa,
and the East, where people wanted sturdy, inexpensive
clothes rather than costly, highly finished luxury items.
Britain’s machine-produced textile industry fulfilled that
demand. Nor should we overlook the British domestic
market. Britain had the highest standard of living in
Europe and a rapidly growing population. This demand
from both domestic and foreign markets and the inability
of the old system to fulfill it led entrepreneurs to seek and
accept the new methods of manufacturing that a series
of inventions provided. Thus was the Industrial Revolution born.
Technological Changes and New Forms
of Industrial Organization
In the 1770s and 1780s, the cotton textile industry took
the first major revolutionary step by inventing the modern factory.
The Cotton Industry Already in the eighteenth century,
Great Britain had surged ahead in the production of cheap
cotton goods using traditional cottage industry methods.
The development of the flying shuttle had speeded the
process of weaving on a loom and enabled weavers to
double their output. This led to shortages of yarn, however, until James Hargreaves’s spinning jenny, perfected
by 1768, allowed spinners to produce yarn in greater
quantities. Edmund Cartwright’s power loom, invented in
1787, allowed the weaving of cloth to catch up with the
spinning of yarn and presented new opportunities to entrepreneurs. It was much more efficient to bring workers
to the machines and organize their labor collectively in
factories located next to rivers and streams, the sources of
power for many of these early machines, than to leave the
workers dispersed in their cottages. The concentration of
labor in the new factories also brought the laborers and
their families to live in the new towns that rapidly grew up
around the factories.
The Steam Engine What pushed the cotton industry to
even greater heights of productivity was the invention of
the steam engine, which revolutionized the production of
cotton goods and allowed the factory system to spread to
other areas of production, thereby creating whole new
industries. The steam engine secured the triumph of the
Industrial Revolution.
In the 1760s, a Scottish engineer, James Watt (1736--
1819), invented an engine powered by steam that could
pump water from mines three times as quickly as previous engines. In 1782, Watt enlarged those possibilities
when he developed a rotary engine that could turn a shaft
and thus drive machinery. Steam power could now be
applied to spinning and weaving cotton, and before long,
cotton mills using steam engines were multiplying across
Britain. Because steam engines were fired by coal, they did
not need to be located near rivers; entrepreneurs now had
greater flexibility in their choice of location.
The new boost given to cotton textile production by
technological changes became readily apparent. In 1760,
Britain had imported 2.5 million pounds of raw cotton,
which was farmed out to cottage industries. In 1787, the
British imported 22 million pounds of cotton; most of it
was spun on machines, some powered by water in large
mills. By 1840, fully 366 million pounds of cotton---now
Britain’s most important product in value---were imported. By this time, most cotton industry employees
worked in factories. The cheapest labor in India could
not compete in quality or quantity with Britain. British
cotton goods sold everywhere in the world. And in
Britain itself, cheap cotton cloth made it possible for
millions of poor people to wear undergarments, long a
luxury of the rich, who could afford expensive linen cloth.
Cotton clothing was tough, comfortable, cheap, and easily
washable.
The steam engine proved indispensable. Unlike horses,
the steam engine was a tireless source of power and depended for fuel on a substance---coal---that seemed in unlimited supply. The popular saying that ‘‘steam is an
Englishman’’ had real significance by 1850. The success of
the steam engine led to a need for more coal and an expansion in coal production; between 1815 and 1850, the
output of coal quadrupled. In turn, new processes using
coal furthered the development of the iron industry.
The Iron Industry The British iron industry was
radically transformed during the Industrial Revolution.
Britain had large resources of iron ore, but at the beginning of the eighteenth century, the basic process for
producing iron had altered little since the Middle Ages
and still depended heavily on charcoal. In the early eighteenth century, new methods of smelting iron ore to
produce cast iron were devised using coke derived from
coal. Still, a better quality of iron was not attained until
the 1780s, when Henry Cort developed a system called
puddling, in which coke was used to burn away impurities
in pig iron to produce an iron of high quality. A boom
then ensued in the British iron industry. In 1740, Britain
produced 17,000 tons of iron; by the 1840s, over 2 million
tons; and by 1852, almost 3 million tons, more than the
rest of the world combined.
A Revolution in Transportation The high-quality
wrought iron produced by the Cort process encouraged
the use of machinery in other industries, most noticeably
in such new means of transportation as steamboats and
railroads. In 1804, Richard Trevithick pioneered the first
steam-powered locomotive on an industrial rail line in
southern Wales. It pulled 10 tons of ore and seventy
people at 5 miles per hour. Better locomotives soon followed. The engines built by George Stephenson and his
son proved superior, and it was in their workshops in
Newcastle-upon-Tyne that the locomotives for the first
modern railways in Britain were built. George Stephenson’s
Rocket was used on the first public railway line, which
opened in 1830, extending 32 miles from Liverpool to
Manchester. Rocket sped along at 16 miles per hour.
Within twenty years, locomotives had reached 50 miles
per hour, an incredible speed to contemporary passengers. During the same period, new companies were
formed to build additional railroads as the infant industry
proved successful not only technically but also financially.
In 1840, Britain had almost 2,000 miles of railroads; ten
years later, 6,000 miles of track crisscrossed the country
(see Map 20.1).
The railroad contributed significantly to the maturing of the Industrial Revolution. The railroad’s demands for coal and iron furthered the growth of those
industries. Railway construction created new job opportunities, especially for farm laborers and peasants
who had long been accustomed to finding work outside
their local villages. Perhaps most important, the availability of a cheaper and faster means of transportation
had a domino effect on the growth of the industrial
economy. By lowering the price of goods, fast transportation caused markets to grow, and this increased
demand necessitated more factories and more machinery, thereby reinforcing the self-sustaining nature of the
Industrial Revolution. This dynamism marked a fundamental break with the traditional European economy.
The great productivity of the Industrial Revolution enabled entrepreneurs to reinvest their profits in new capital
equipment, further expanding the productive capacity of
the economy. Continuous, self-sustaining economic growth
came to be seen as a fundamental characteristic of the new
industrial economy.
The railroad was the perfect symbol of this aspect of
the Industrial Revolution. The ability to transport goods
and people at dramatic speeds also provided visible
confirmation of a new sense of power. When railway
builders penetrated mountains with tunnels and spanned
chasms with breathtaking bridges, contemporaries experienced a sense of power over nature not felt before in
Western civilization.
The Industrial Factory Another visible symbol of the
Industrial Revolution was the factory, which became the
chief means of organizing labor for the new machines.
From its beginning, the factory system demanded a new
type of discipline from its employees. Factory owners
could not afford to let their expensive machinery stand
idle. Workers were forced to work regular hours and in
shifts to keep the machines producing at a steady pace for
maximum output. This required a massive adjustment on
the part of early factory laborers.
Preindustrial workers were not accustomed to a
‘‘timed’’ format. Agricultural laborers had always kept
irregular hours; hectic work at harvest time might be
followed by days or weeks of inactivity. Even in the
burgeoning cottage industry of the eighteenth century,
weavers and spinners who worked at home might fulfill
their weekly quotas by working around the clock for
two or three days and then proceeding at a leisurely
pace until the next week’s demands forced another work
spurt.
Factory owners therefore faced a formidable task.
They had to create a system of time-work discipline in
which employees became accustomed to working regular, unvarying hours during which they performed a
set number of tasks over and over again as efficiently as
possible. One early industrialist said that his aim was
‘‘to make such machines of the men as cannot err.’’ Such
work, of course, tended to be repetitive and boring, and
factory owners resorted to tough methods to accomplish their goals. Factory regulations were minute and
detailed (see the box on p. 428). Adult workers were
fined for a wide variety of minor infractions, such as
being a few minutes late for work, and dismissed for
more serious misdeeds, especially intoxication. Drunkenness was viewed as particularly offensive because it set
a bad example for younger workers and also courted
disaster around dangerous machinery. Employers found
that dismissals and fines worked well for adult employees; in
a time when great population growth had produced large
masses of unskilled labor, dismissal could be disastrous.
Children were less likely to understand the implications
of dismissal, so they were sometimes disciplined more
directly---by beating. In one crucial sense, the early industrialists proved successful in their efforts. As the nineteenth century progressed, the second and third generations
of workers came to view a regular workweek as a natural way
of life. That attitude sustained Britain’s incredible economic
growth in that century.
The Great Exhibition: Britain in 1851
In 1851, the British organized the world’s first industrial
fair. It was housed at Kensington in London in the Crystal
Palace, an enormous structure made entirely of glass and
iron, a tribute to British engineering skills. Covering 19
acres, the Crystal Palace contained more than 100,000
exhibits that showed the wide variety of products created
by the Industrial Revolution. Six million people visited
the fair in six months. The Great Exhibition displayed
Britain’s wealth to the world; it was a gigantic symbol of
British success. Even trees were brought inside the Crystal
Palace as a visible symbol of how the Industrial Revolution had achieved human domination over nature.
By the year of the Great Exhibition, Great Britain had
become the world’s first and richest industrial nation.
Britain was the ‘‘workshop, banker, and trader of the
world.’’ It produced one-half of the world’s coal and
manufactured goods; its cotton industry alone in 1851
was equal in size to the industries of all other European
countries combined. No doubt Britain’s certainty about
its mission in the world in the nineteenth century was
grounded in its incredible material success.
The Spread of Industrialization
Q Focus Question: What caused the Industrial
Revolution to spread from Great Britain to the
European continent and the United States, and how
did industrialization in those areas differ from
industrialization in Britain?
Industrialization spread from Great Britain to the Continental countries of Europe and America at different times
and speeds during the nineteenth century. First to be industrialized on the Continent were Belgium, France, and
the German states, and in North America, the young
United States. Not until after 1850 did the Industrial
Revolution spread to the rest of Europe and other parts of
the world.
Industrialization on the Continent
Industrialization on the Continent faced numerous hurdles, and as it proceeded in earnest after 1815, it did so
along lines that were somewhat different from Britain’s.
Lack of technical knowledge was initially a major obstacle
to industrialization. But the Continental countries had an
advantage here: they could simply borrow British techniques and practices. Of course, the British tried to prevent
that. Until 1825, British artisans were prohibited from
leaving the country; until 1842, the export of important
machinery and machine parts was forbidden. Nevertheless,
the British were not able to control this situation by legislation. Already by 1825, there were at least two thousand
skilled British mechanics on the Continent, and British
equipment was being sold abroad, legally or illegally.
Gradually, the Continent achieved technological independence as local people learned all the skills their British
teachers had to offer. By the 1840s, a new generation of
skilled mechanics from Belgium and France was spreading
their knowledge to the east and south. More important,
however, Continental countries, especially France and the
German states, began to establish a wide range of technical
schools to train engineers and mechanics.
That government played an important role in this
brings us to a second difference between British and
Continental industrialization. Governments in most of
the Continental countries were accustomed to playing a
significant role in economic affairs. Furthering the development of industrialization was a logical extension of
that attitude. Hence governments provided for the costs
of technical education, awarded grants to inventors
and foreign entrepreneurs, exempted foreign industrial
equipment from import duties, and in some places even
financed factories. Of equal if not greater importance in
the long run, governments actively bore much of the cost
of building roads and canals, deepening and widening
river channels, and constructing railroads. By 1850, a
network of iron rails had spread across Europe, although
only Germany and Belgium had largely completed their
systems by that time.
Centers of Continental Industrialization
As noted earlier, the Industrial Revolution on the Continent occurred in three major centers between 1815 and
1850---Belgium, France, and the German states (see
Map 20.2). Cotton played an important role, although it
was not as significant as heavy industry. The development
of cotton manufacturing on the Continent and Britain
differed in two significant ways. Unlike Britain, where
cotton manufacturing was mostly centered in Lancashire
(in northwestern England) and the Glasgow area of
Scotland, cotton mills in France, Germany, and to a lesser
degree Belgium were dispersed through many regions.
Noticeable, too, was the mixture of old and new. The old
techniques of the cottage system, such as the use of hand
looms, held on much longer. In the French district of
Normandy, for example, in 1849, eighty-three mills were
still driven by hand or animal power.
Heavy industry on the Continent before 1850 was
likewise a mixture of old and new. The adoption of new
techniques, such as coke-smelted iron and puddling furnaces, coincided with the expansion of old-type charcoal
blast furnaces. Before 1850, Germany lagged significantly
behind both Belgium and France in heavy industry, and
most German iron manufacturing remained based on old
techniques. Not until the 1840s was coke-blast iron produced in the Rhineland. At that time, no one had yet
realized the treasure of coal buried in the Ruhr valley. A
German official wrote in 1852 that ‘‘it is clearly not to be
expected that Germany will ever be able to reach the level
of production of coal and iron currently attained in England. This is implicit in our far more limited resource
endowment.’’ Little did he realize that although the industrial development of Continental Europe was about a
generation behind Britain at mid-century, after 1850 an
incredibly rapid growth in Continental industry would
demonstrate that Britain was not, after all, destined to
remain the world’s greatest industrial nation.
The Industrial Revolution in the United States
In 1800, the United States was an agrarian society. There
were no cities with populations of more than 100,000,
and six out of every seven American workers were
farmers. By 1860, however, the population had grown
from 5 to 30 million people, larger than Great Britain.
Almost half of them lived west of the Appalachian
Mountains. The number of states had more than doubled,
from sixteen to thirty-four, and nine American cities had
populations of more than 100,000. Only 50 percent of
American workers were farmers. In those sixty years, the
United States was transformed from a farm-centered
society of small communities to an industrializing, urbanizing nation.
The initial application of machinery to production
was accomplished, as in Continental Europe, by borrowing from Great Britain. A British immigrant, Samuel
Slater, established the first textile factory using waterpowered spinning machines in Rhode Island in 1790.
By 1813, factories with power looms copied from British
versions were being established. Soon thereafter, however,
Americans began to equal or surpass British technical
inventions. The Harpers Ferry arsenal, for example, built
muskets with interchangeable parts. Because the individual parts of various muskets were identical (for example, all triggers were the same), the final product could
be put together quickly and easily; this enabled Americans
to avoid the more costly system in which skilled craftspeople fitted together individual parts made separately.
The so-called American system reduced costs and revolutionized production by saving labor, important to a
society that had few skilled artisans.
Unlike Britain, the United States was a large country.
The lack of a good system of internal transportation
seemed to limit American economic development by
making the transport of goods prohibitively expensive.
This was gradually remedied, however. Thousands of
miles of roads and canals were built linking east and west.
The steamboat facilitated transportation on the Great
Lakes, Atlantic coastal waters, and rivers. It was especially
important to the Mississippi River valley; by 1860, a
thousand steamboats plied the Mississippi (see the box on
p. 431). Most important of all in the development of
an American transportation system was the railroad.
Beginning with 100 miles in 1830, by 1860 there were
more than 27,000 miles of railroad track covering the
United States. This transportation revolution turned the
United States into a single massive market for the manufactured goods of the Northeast, the early center of
American industrialization.
Labor for the growing number of factories in this
area came primarily from rural New England. The United
States did not possess a large number of craftspeople, but
it did have a rapidly expanding farm population; its size
in the Northeast soon outstripped the available farmland.
While some of this excess population, especially men,
went west, others, mostly women, found work in the new
textile and shoe factories of New England. Indeed, women
made up more than 80 percent of the labor force in the
large textile factories. In Massachusetts mill towns,
company boarding houses provided rooms for large
numbers of young women who worked for several years
before marriage. Outside Massachusetts, factory owners
sought entire families, including children, to work in their
mills; one mill owner ran this advertisement in a newspaper in Utica, New York: ‘‘Wanted: A few sober and
industrious families of at least five children each, over the
age of eight years, are wanted at the Cotton Factory in
Whitestown. Widows with large families would do well to
attend this notice.’’ When a decline in rural births
threatened to dry up this labor pool in the 1830s and
1840s, European immigrants, especially poor and unskilled
Irish, English, Scottish, and Welsh, appeared in large
numbers to replace American women and children in the
factories.
By 1860, the United States was well on its way to
being an industrial nation. In the Northeast, the most
industrialized section of the country, per capita income
was 40 percent higher than the national average. Diets, it
has been argued, were better and more varied; machinemade clothing was more abundant. Nevertheless, despite
a growing belief in a myth of social mobility based on
equality of economic opportunity, the reality was that the
richest 10 percent of the population in the cities held 70
to 80 percent of the wealth, compared to 50 percent in
1800. Nevertheless, American historians generally argue
that while the rich got richer, the poor, as a result of
experiencing an increase in their purchasing power, did
not get poorer.
Limiting the Spread of Industrialization
Before 1870, the industrialization that had developed in
western and central Europe and the United States did not
extend in any significant way to the rest of the world.
Even in eastern Europe, industrialization lagged far behind. Russia, for example, remained largely rural and
agricultural with an autocratic regime that kept the
peasants in serfdom. There was not much of a middle
class, and the tsarist regime, fearful of change, preferred
to import industrial goods in return for the export of raw
materials, such as grain and timber. Russia would not
have an Industrial Revolution until the end of the nineteenth century.
The Example of India In other parts of the world
where they had established control, newly industrialized
European states pursued a deliberate policy of preventing
the growth of mechanized industry. A good example is
India. In the eighteenth century, India had become one of
the world’s greatest exporters of cotton cloth produced by
hand labor. In the first half of the nineteenth century,
much of India fell under the control of the British East
India Company (see Chapter 24). With British control
came inexpensive British factory-produced textiles, and
soon thousands of Indian spinners and hand-loom weavers were unemployed. British policy encouraged Indians
to export their raw materials while buying British-made
goods. Although modest industrial factories for making
textiles and jute (used in making rope) were opened in
India in the 1850s, a lack of local capital and the advantages given to British imports limited the growth of
new manufacturing operations. India, then, provides an
excellent example of how some of the rapidly industrializing nations of Europe worked to deliberately thwart
the spread of the Industrial Revolution to their colonial
dominions.
The Social Impact of the
Industrial Revolution
Q Focus Questions: What effects did the Industrial
Revolution have on urban life, social classes, family
life, and standards of living? What were working
conditions like in the early decades of the Industrial
Revolution, and what efforts were made to improve
them?
The Industrial Revolution transfigured the social life of
Europe and the world. Although much of Europe remained
bound by its traditional ways, the social impact of the
Industrial Revolution was already being felt in the first half
of the nineteenth century, and future avenues of growth
were becoming apparent. Vast changes in the number of
people and where they lived were already dramatically
evident.
Population Growth
Population increases had begun in the eighteenth century,
but they became dramatic in the nineteenth century. In
1750, the total European population stood at an estimated
140 million; by 1800, it had increased to 187 million and,
by 1850, to 266 million, almost twice its 1750 level. The
key to the expansion of population was the decline in
death rates evident throughout Europe. Two major factors
explain this decline: fewer premature deaths and better
nutrition. The number of deaths from famines, epidemics,
and war dropped substantially. Major epidemic diseases in
particular, such as plague and smallpox, became less
common, although small-scale epidemics did occur. The
ordinary death rate also declined as a general increase in
the food supply, already evident in the agricultural revolution of Britain in the late eighteenth century, spread to
more areas. More food enabled a greater number of people
to be better fed and therefore more resistant to disease.
Famine largely disappeared from western Europe, although
there were dramatic exceptions in isolated areas where
overpopulation magnified the problem of rural poverty. In
Ireland, it produced the century’s great catastrophe.
The Great Hunger Ireland was one of the most oppressed areas in western Europe. The predominantly
Catholic peasant population rented land from mostly
absentee British Protestant landlords whose primary
concern was collecting their rents. Irish peasants lived in
mud hovels in desperate poverty. The cultivation of the
potato, a nutritious and relatively easy crop to grow that
produced three times as much food per acre as grain, gave
Irish peasants a basic staple that enabled them to survive
and even expand in numbers. Between 1781 and 1845, the
Irish population doubled from four to eight million.
Probably half of this population depended on the potato
for survival. In the summer of 1845, the potato crop in
Ireland was struck by a fungus that turned the potato
black. The resulting Great Famine decimated the Irish
population between 1845 and 1851. More than one million inhabitants died of starvation and disease, and almost two million more emigrated to the United States
and Britain. Of all the European nations, only Ireland lost
population in the nineteenth century.
The flight of so many Irish to America reminds us
that the traditional safety valve for overpopulation has
always been emigration. Between 1821 and 1850, the
number of emigrants from Europe averaged about 110,000
a year. Most of these emigrants came from places like
Ireland and southern Germany, where peasant life had
been reduced to a marginal existence. More often than
emigration, however, the rural masses sought a solution to
their poverty by moving to towns and cities within their
own countries to find work. It should not astonish us then
that the first half of the nineteenth century was a period of
rapid urbanization.
The Growth of Cities
Cities and towns grew dramatically in the first half of the
nineteenth century, a phenomenon related to industrialization. Cities had traditionally been centers for princely
courts, government and military offices, churches, and
commerce. By 1850, especially in Great Britain and Belgium, they were rapidly becoming places for manufacturing and industry. With the steam engine, entrepreneurs
could locate their manufacturing plants in urban centers
where they had ready access to transportation facilities and
influxes of people from the countryside looking for work.
In 1800, Great Britain had one major city, London,
with a population of one million and six cities that were
home to 50,000 to 100,000 people. Fifty years later, London’s population had swelled to 2,363,000, and there were
nine cities with populations over 100,000 and eighteen
with populations between 50,000 and 100,000. More than
50 percent of the British population now lived in towns
and cities. Urban populations also grew on the Continent,
but less dramatically.
Urban Living Conditions in the Early Industrial
Era The dramatic growth of cities in the first half of the
nineteenth century produced miserable living conditions
for many of the inhabitants. Of course, this had been true
for centuries in European cities, but the rapid urbanization
associated with the Industrial Revolution intensified the
problems and made these wretched conditions all
the more apparent. Wealthy, middle-class inhabitants, as
usual, insulated themselves as best they could, often living
in suburbs or the outer ring of the city where they could
have individual houses and gardens. In the inner ring of
the city stood the small row houses, some with gardens,
of the artisans and lower middle class. Finally, located in
the center of most industrial towns were the row houses
of the industrial workers. This report on working-class
housing in the British city of Birmingham in 1843 gives
an idea of the general conditions they faced:
The courts [of working-class row houses] are extremely
numerous; . . . a very large portion of the poorer classes of the
inhabitants reside in them. . . . The courts vary in the number
of the houses which they contain, from four to twenty, and
most of these houses are three stories high, and built, as it is
termed, back to back. There is a wash-house, an ash-pit, and
a privy at the end, or on one side of the court, and not
unfrequently one or more pigsties and heaps of manure.
Generally speaking, the privies in the old courts are in a most
filthy condition. Many which we have inspected were in a
state which renders it impossible for us to conceive how they
could be used; they were without doors and overflowing
with filth.1
Rooms were not large and were frequently overcrowded, as this government report of 1838 revealed:
‘‘I entered several of the tenements. In one of them, on the
ground floor, I found six persons occupying a very small
room, two in bed, ill with fever.
In the room above this were
two more persons in one bed,
ill with fever.’’ Another report
said, ‘‘There were 63 families
where there were at least five
persons to one bed; and there
were some in which even six
were packed in one bed, lying at
the top and bottom---children
and adults.’’2
Sanitary conditions in these
towns were appalling. Due to
the lack of municipal direction,
city streets were often used as
sewers and open drains: ‘‘In the
centre of this street is a gutter,
into which potato parings, the
refuse of animal and vegetable
matters of all kinds, the dirty
water from the washing of clothes and of the houses,
are all poured, and there they stagnate and putrefy.’’3
Unable to deal with human excrement, cities in the new
industrial era smelled horrible and were extraordinarily
unhealthy. The use of coal blackened towns and cities
with soot was well described by Charles Dickens in one
of his novels: ‘‘a long suburb of red brick houses---some
with patches of garden ground, where coal-dust and
factory smoke darkened the shrinking leaves, and coarse
rank flowers; and where the struggling vegetation sickened and sank under the hot breath of kiln and furnace.’’4 Towns and cities were fundamentally death
traps. As deaths outnumbered births in most large cities
in the first half of the nineteenth century, only a constant flow of people from rural areas kept them alive
and growing.
Urban Reformers To many of the well-to-do middle
classes, this situation presented a clear danger to society.
Were not these masses of workers, sunk in crime, filth,
disease, and immorality, a potential threat to their own
well-being? Might not the masses be organized and used
by unscrupulous demagogues to overthrow the established order? Some observers, however, wondered if the
workers could be held responsible for their fate. One of
the best of a new breed of urban reformers was Edwin
Chadwick (1800--1890). Chadwick became obsessed
with eliminating the poverty and squalor of the metropolitan areas. As secretary of the Poor Law Commission,
he initiated a passionate search for detailed facts about
the living conditions of the working classes. After three
years of investigation, Chadwick summarized the results
in his Report on the Condition of the Labouring Population of Great Britain, published in 1842. In it he concluded that ‘‘the various forms of epidemic, endemic,
and other disease’’ were directly caused by the ‘‘atmospheric impurities produced by decomposing animal
and vegetable substances, by damp and filth, and close
overcrowded dwellings [prevailing] amongst the population in every part of the kingdom.’’ Such conditions, he
argued, could be eliminated. As to the means, ‘‘The
primary and most important measures, and at the same
time the most practicable, and within the recognized
province of public administration, are drainage, the removal of all refuse of habitations, streets, and roads, and
the improvement of the supplies of water.’’5 In other
words, Chadwick was advocating a system of modern
sanitary reforms consisting of efficient sewers and a
supply of piped water. Six years after his report and largely
due to his efforts, Britain’s first Public Health Act created
the National Board of Health, which was empowered to
form local boards that would establish modern sanitary
systems.
New Social Classes:
The Industrial Middle Class
The rise of industrial capitalism added a new group to the
middle class. The bourgeoisie or middle class was not
new; it had existed since the emergence of cities in the
Middle Ages. Originally, the bourgeois was a burgher or
town dweller---a merchant, official, artisan, lawyer, or man
of letters---who enjoyed a special set of rights from the
charter of his town. As wealthy townspeople bought land,
the term bourgeois came to include people involved in
commerce, industry, and banking as well as professionals,
such as lawyers, teachers, and physicians, and government
officials at varying levels. At the lower end of the economic scale were master craftspeople and shopkeepers.
Lest we make the industrial middle class too much of
an abstraction, we need to look at who the new industrial
entrepreneurs actually were. These were the people who
constructed the factories, purchased the machines, and
figured out where the markets were. Their qualities included resourcefulness, single-mindedness, resolution,
initiative, vision, ambition, and often greed. As Jedediah
Strutt, a cotton manufacturer said, ‘‘Getting of money . . .is
the main business of the life of men.’’ But this was not an
easy task. The early industrial entrepreneurs were called on
to superintend an enormous array of functions that are
handled today by teams of managers; they raised capital,
determined markets, set company objectives, organized the
factory and its labor, and trained supervisors who could
act for them. The opportunities for making money were
great, but the risks were also tremendous.
By 1850, in Britain at least, the kind of traditional
entrepreneurship that had fueled the Industrial Revolution
was declining and being replaced by a new business
aristocracy. This new generation of entrepreneurs stemmed
from the professional and industrial middle classes,
especially as sons inherited successful businesses established by their fathers. Increasingly, the new industrial
entrepreneurs---the bankers and owners of factories and
mines---came to amass much wealth and play an important
role alongside the traditional landed elites of their societies. The Industrial Revolution began at a time when the
agrarian world was still largely dominated by landed elites.
As members of the new bourgeoisie bought great estates
and acquired social respectability, they also sought political
power, and in the course of the nineteenth century, their
wealthiest members would merge with those old elites.
New Social Classes:
Workers in the Industrial Age
At the same time that the members of the industrial middle
class were seeking to reduce the barriers between themselves
and the landed elite, they were also trying to separate
themselves from the laboring classes below them. The
working class was actually a mixture of groups in the first
half of the nineteenth century. Factory workers would
eventually form an industrial proletariat, but they did not yet
constitute a majority of the working class in any major city,
even in Britain. According to the 1851 census in Britain,
while there were 1.8 million agricultural laborers and 1 million domestic servants, there were only 811,000 workers in
the cotton and woolen industries, and one-third of these
were still working in small workshops or in their own homes.
Working Conditions for the Industrial Working
Class Workers in the new industrial factories faced
wretched working conditions. Unquestionably, in the
early decades of the Industrial Revolution, ‘‘places of
work,’’ as early factories were called, were dreadful. Work
hours ranged from twelve to sixteen hours a day, six days
a week, with a half hour for lunch and dinner. There was
no security of employment and no minimum wage. The
worst conditions were endured by workers in the cotton
mills, where temperatures were especially debilitating.
One report noted that ‘‘in the cotton-spinning work,
these creatures are kept, fourteen hours in each day,
locked up, summer and winter, in a heat of from eighty
to eighty-four degrees.’’ Mills were also dirty, dusty, and
unhealthy:
Not only is there not a breath of sweet air in these truly infernal scenes, but . . . there is the abominable and pernicious
stink of the gas to assist in the murderous effects of the heat.
In addition to the noxious effluvia of the gas, mixed with the
steam, there are the dust, and what is called cotton-flyings or
fuz, which the unfortunate creatures have to inhale;
and . . . the notorious fact is that well constitutioned men are
rendered old and past labour at forty years of age, and that
children are rendered decrepit and deformed, and thousands
upon thousands of them slaughtered by consumptions [wasting away of body tissues, especially the lungs], before they
arrive at the age of sixteen.6
Conditions in the coal mines were also harsh. The
introduction of steam power in the coal mines meant
only that steam-powered engines mechanically lifted coal
to the top. Inside the mines, men still bore the burden of
digging the coal out while horses, mules, women, and
children hauled coal carts on rails to the lift. Dangers
abounded in coal mines; cave-ins, explosions, and gas
fumes (called ‘‘bad air’’) were a way of life. The cramped
conditions---tunnels often did not exceed 3 or 4 feet in
height---and constant dampness in the mines resulted in
deformed bodies and ruined lungs.
Both children and women were employed in large
numbers in early factories and mines. Children had been
an important part of the family economy in preindustrial
times, working in the fields or carding and spinning wool
at home with the growth of the cottage industry. In the
Industrial Revolution, however, child labor was exploited
more than ever and in a considerably more systematic
fashion (see the box above). The owners of cotton factories appreciated certain features of child labor. Children had an especially delicate touch as spinners of
cotton. Their smaller size made it easier for them to
crawl under machines to gather loose cotton. Moreover,
children were more easily accustomed to factory work.
Above all, children represented a cheap supply of labor.
In 1821, half the British population was under twenty
years of age. Hence children made up a particularly
abundant supply of labor, and they were paid only onesixth to one-third of what a man was paid. In the cotton
factories in 1838, children under eighteen made up
29 percent of the workforce; children as young as seven
worked twelve to fifteen hours per day, six days a week,
in the cotton mills.
By 1830, women and children made up two-thirds
of the cotton industry’s labor. However, as the number
of children employed declined under the Factory Act of
1833, their places were taken by women, who came to
dominate the labor forces of the early factories. Women
made up 50 percent of the labor force in textile (cotton
and woolen) factories before 1870. They were mostly
unskilled labor and were paid half or less of what
men received. Excessive working hours for women were
outlawed in 1844, but only in textile factories and
mines; not until 1867 were they outlawed in craft
workshops.
The employment of children and women in large
part represents a continuation of a preindustrial kinship
pattern. The cottage industry had always involved the
efforts of the entire family, and it seemed perfectly natural
to continue this pattern. Men migrating from the countryside to industrial towns and cities took their wives and
children with them into the factory or into the mines. Of
136 employees in Robert Peel’s factory at Bury in 1801, 95
came from twenty-six families. The impetus for this
family work often came from the family itself. The factory
owner Jedediah Strutt was opposed to employing children
under ten but was forced by parents to take children as
young as seven.
The employment of large numbers of women in
factories did not produce a significant transformation in
female working patterns, as was once assumed. Studies
of urban households in France and Britain, for example,
have revealed that throughout the nineteenth century,
traditional types of female labor still predominated
in the women’s work world. In 1851, fully 40 percent of
the working women in Britain were employed as
domestic servants. In France, the largest group of female
workers, 40 percent, worked in agriculture. Only
20 percent of female workers labored in Britain’s factories, and only 10 percent in France. Regional and local
studies have also indicated that most of them were
single women. Few married women worked outside the
home.
The laws that limited the work hours of children
and women also began to break up the traditional
kinship pattern of work and led to a new pattern based
on a separation of work and home. Men were expected
to shoulder the primary work obligations while women
assumed daily control of the family and performed
low-paying jobs such as laundry work that could be
done in the home. Domestic industry made it possible
for women to continue their contributions to family
survival.
Historians have also reminded us that if the treatment of children in the mines and factories seems particularly cruel and harsh, contemporary treatment of
children in general was often brutal. Beatings, for example, had long been regarded, even by dedicated churchmen and churchwomen, as the best way to discipline
children.
The problem of poverty among the working classes
was also addressed in Britain by government action in the
form of the Poor Law Act of 1834, which established
workhouses where jobless poor people were forced to live.
The intent of this policy, based on the assumption that
the poor were responsible for their own pitiful conditions, was ‘‘to make the workhouses as like prisons as
possible . . . to establish therein a discipline so severe and
repulsive as to make them a terror to the poor.’’ Within a
few years, despite sporadic opposition, more than 200,000
poor people were locked up in workhouses, where family
members were separated, forced to live in dormitories,
given work assignments, and fed dreadful food. Children
were often recruited from parish workhouses as cheap
labor in factories.
Efforts at Change: The Workers
Before long, workers in Great Britain began to look to
the formation of labor organizations to gain decent
wages and working conditions. Despite government
opposition, new associations known as trade unions
were formed by skilled workers in a number of new industries, including the cotton spinners, ironworkers, coal
miners, and shipwrights. These unions served two purposes. One was to preserve their own workers’ positions
by limiting entry into their trade; another was to gain
benefits from the employers. These early trade unions
had limited goals. They favored a working-class struggle
against employers, but only to win improvements for the
members of their own trades. The largest and most
successful was the Amalgamated Society of Engineers,
formed in 1850. Its provision of generous unemployment benefits in return for a small weekly payment was
precisely the kind of practical gains these trade unions
sought.
Luddites Trade unionism was not the only type of
collective action by workers in the early decades of the
Industrial Revolution. The Luddites were skilled craftsmen in the Midlands and northern England who in 1812
physically attacked the machines that they believed
threatened their livelihoods. Their actions failed to stop
the industrial mechanization of Britain, but the inability
of twelve thousand troops to track down the culprits
provides stunning evidence of the local support they
enjoyed.
Chartism A more meaningful expression of the attempts of British workers to improve their condition
developed in the movement known as Chartism. Its aim
was to achieve political democracy. It took its name from
the People’s Charter, a document drawn up in 1838 by
the London Working Men’s Association. The charter
demanded universal male suffrage, payment for members
of Parliament, the elimination of property qualifications
for members of Parliament, and annual sessions of
Parliament.
Two national petitions incorporating these demands
gained millions of signatures and were presented to
Parliament in 1839 and 1842. Chartism attempted
to encourage change through peaceful, constitutional
means, although there was an underlying threat of force,
as is evident in the Chartist slogan, ‘‘Peacefully if we can,
forcibly if we must.’’ In 1842, Chartist activists organized
a general strike on behalf of their goals, but it had little
success.
Despite the pressures exerted by Chartists, both national petitions were rejected by the members of Parliament, who were not at all ready for political democracy.
As one member said, universal suffrage would be ‘‘fatal to
all the purposes for which government exists’’ and was
‘‘utterly incompatible with the very existence of civilization.’’ After 1848, Chartism as a movement had largely
played itself out. It had never really posed a serious threat
to the British establishment, but it had not been a total
failure either. Its true significance stemmed from its ability
to arouse and organize millions of working-class men and
women, to give them a sense of working-class consciousness that they had not really possessed before. The political
education of working people was important to the ultimate acceptance of the goals expressed in the People’s
Charter.
Efforts at Change: Reformers and Government
Efforts to improve the worst conditions of the industrial
factory system also came from outside the ranks of the
working classes. Reform-minded individuals, be they
factory owners who felt twinges of conscience or social
reformers in Parliament, campaigned against the evils of
the industrial factory, especially condemning the abuse
of children. Their efforts eventually met with success,
especially in the reform-minded decades of the 1830s
and 1840s. The Factory Act of 1833 stipulated that
children between nine and thirteen could work only
eight hours a day; those between thirteen and eighteen,
twelve hours. Another piece of legislation in 1833 required that children between nine and thirteen have at
least two hours of elementary education during the
working day. In 1847, the Ten Hours Act reduced the
workday for children between thirteen and eighteen to ten
hours. Women were also now included in the ten-hour
limitation. In 1842, the Coal Mines Act eliminated the
employment of boys under ten and all women in mines.
Eventually, men too would benefit from the move to
restrict factory hours.
CONCLUSION
The Industrial Revolution became one of the major forces
of change in the nineteenth century as it led Western civilization
into the industrial era that has characterized the modern world.
Beginning in Britain, its spread to the Continent and the new
American nation ensured its growth and domination of the
Western world.
The Industrial Revolution seemed to prove to Europeans
the underlying assumption of the Scientific Revolution of the
seventeenth century---that human beings were capable of dominating nature. By rationally manipulating the material environment for
human benefit, people could create new levels of material prosperity
and produce machines not dreamed of in their wildest imaginings.
Lost in the excitement of the Industrial Revolution were the voices
that pointed to the dehumanization of the workforce and the
alienation from one’s work, one’s associates, oneself, and the
natural world.

The Industrial Revolution also transformed the social
world of Europe. The rise of an industrial proletariat produced a
whole new force for change. The development of a wealthy
industrial middle class presented a challenge to the long-term
hegemony of landed wealth. Though that wealth had been
threatened by the fortunes of commerce, it had never been
overturned. But the new bourgeoisie was more demanding. How,
in some places, this new industrial bourgeoisie came to play a
larger role in the affairs of state will become evident in the
next chapter.
