WHILE MANY EUROPEANS were occupied with the problems
of dynastic expansion and religious reform, others were taking
voyages that propelled Europeans far beyond the medieval walls in
which they had been enclosed for almost a thousand years. One of
these adventurers was the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan.
Convinced that he could find a sea passage to Asia through America,
Magellan persuaded the king of Spain to finance an exploratory voyage. On August 10, 1519, Magellan set sail on the Atlantic with five
ships and a Spanish crew of 277 men. After a stormy and difficult
crossing of the ocean, Magellan’s fleet moved down the coast of
South America, searching for the strait that would take him
through. His Spanish ship captains thought he was crazy: ‘‘The fool
is obsessed with his search for a strait,’’ one remarked. ‘‘On the
flame of his ambition he will crucify us all.’’ At last, in October
1520, he found it, passing through a narrow waterway (later named
the Strait of Magellan) and emerging into an unknown ocean that
he called the Pacific Sea. Magellan reckoned that it would then be a
short distance to the Spice Islands of the East, but he was badly mistaken. Week after week, he and his crew sailed on across the Pacific
as their food supplies dwindled. According to one account,‘‘When
their last biscuit had gone, they scraped the maggots out of the
casks, mashed them and served them as gruel. They made cakes out
of sawdust soaked with the urine of rats---the rats themselves, as
delicacies, had long since been hunted to extinction.’’ At last they
reached the Philippines (named after King Philip II of Spain), where
Magellan met his death at the hands of the natives. Although only
one of his original fleet of five ships survived and returned to Spain,
Magellan is still remembered as the first person to circumnavigate
the world.

At the beginning of the sixteenth century, European adventurers
like Magellan had begun launching small fleets into the vast reaches
of the Atlantic Ocean. They were hardly aware that they were
launching a new era, not only for Europe, but for the peoples of Asia,
Africa, and the Americas as well. Nevertheless, the voyages of these
Europeans marked the beginning of a process that led to radical
changes in the political, economic, and cultural life of the entire world.

Between 1500 and 1800, European power engulfed the globe. In
the Americas, Europeans established colonies that spread their laws,
religions, and cultures. In the island regions of Southeast Asia, Europeans firmly implanted their rule. Elsewhere in Asia and in many
parts of Africa, their trading activities dramatically affected the lifeways of the local peoples.

On the Brink of a New World
Q Focus Question: Why did Europeans begin to embark
on voyages of discovery and expansion at the end of
the fifteenth century?
Never has the dynamic and at times ruthless energy of
Western civilization been more apparent than during its
sixteenth-century expansion into the rest of the world. By
then the Atlantic seaboard had become a center of commercial activity that raised Portugal and Spain and later
the Dutch Republic, England, and France to worldwide
prominence. Global expansion was a crucial factor in
Europe’s transition from the agrarian economy of the
Middle Ages to a commercial and industrial capitalistic
system that survives to this day. Expansion also led Europeans into new and lasting contacts with non-European
peoples that inaugurated a new interactive age of world
history in the sixteenth century.
The Motives for Expansion
Europeans had long been attracted to lands outside of
Europe as a result of a large body of fantasy literature
about ‘‘other worlds’’ that had blossomed in the Middle
Ages. In The Travels of John Mandeville in the fourteenth
century, the author spoke of lands (which he had never
seen) filled with precious stones and gold. Other lands
were more frightening and considerably less appealing,
‘‘where the folk be great giants of twenty-eight foot long,
or thirty foot long. . . . And they eat more gladly man’s
flesh than any other flesh,’’ as well as lands farther north
full of ‘‘cruel and evil women. And they have precious
stones in their eyes. And they be of that kind that if they
behold any man with wrath they slay him at once with the
beholding.’’1 Other writers, however, added a new way
of attracting Europeans to foreign lands when they spoke
of mysterious Christian kingdoms: the magical kingdom of
Prester John in Africa and a Christian community in
southern India that was supposedly founded by Thomas,
the apostle of Jesus.
Although Muslim control of Central Asia cut Europe
off from the countries farther east, the Mongol conquests
in the thirteenth century had reopened the doors. The
most famous medieval travelers to the East were the Polos
of Venice. Niccolo` and Maffeo, merchants from Venice,
accompanied by Niccolo`’s son Marco, undertook the lengthy
journey to the court of the great Mongol ruler Khubilai
Khan (1259--1294) in 1271. An account of Marco’s experiences, the Travels, proved to be the most informative of
all the descriptions of Asia by medieval European travelers.
Others followed the Polos, but in the fourteenth century,
the conquests of the Ottoman Turks and then the breakup
of the Mongol Empire reduced Western traffic to the East.
With the closing of the overland routes, a number of
people in Europe became interested in the possibility of
reaching Asia by sea to gain access to the spices and other
precious resources of the region. Christopher Columbus
had a copy of Marco Polo’s Travels in his possession when
he began to envision his epoch-making voyage across the
Atlantic Ocean.
An economic motive thus loomed large in Renaissance European expansion. Merchants, adventurers, and
government officials had high hopes of finding precious
metals and new areas of trade. Many European explorers
and conquerors did not hesitate to express their desire for
material gain. One Spanish conquistador explained that
he and his kind went to the New World to ‘‘serve God and
His Majesty, to give light to those who were in darkness,
and to grow rich, as all men desire to do.’’2
This statement expresses another major reason for
the overseas voyages: religious zeal. Herna´n Corte´s, the
conqueror of Mexico, asked his Spanish rulers if it was
not their duty to ensure that the native Mexicans ‘‘are
introduced into and instructed in their holy Catholic
faith.’’3 Spiritual and secular affairs were closely intertwined in the sixteenth century. No doubt grandeur and
glory, as well as plain intellectual curiosity and the spirit
of adventure, also played some role in the European
expansion.
The Means for Expansion
If ‘‘God, glory, and gold’’ were the motives, what made
the voyages possible? First of all, the expansion of Europe
was connected to the growth of centralized monarchies
during the Renaissance. By the second half of the fifteenth
century, European monarchies had increased both their
authority and their resources and were in a position to
direct their energies beyond their borders. At the same
time, by the end of the fifteenth century, European states
had achieved a level of wealth and technology that enabled them to undertake a regular series of voyages beyond Europe. Europeans had developed remarkably
seaworthy ships and reliable navigational aids, such as the
compass and astrolabe (an instrument used to determine
the position of heavenly bodies).
One of the most important world maps available to
Europeans at the end of the fifteenth century was that
of Ptolemy, an astronomer of the second century A.D.
Ptolemy’s work, the Geography, had been known to Arab
geographers as early as the eighth century, but it was not
until the fifteenth century that a Latin translation was
made. Printed editions of Ptolemy’s Geography, which
contained his world map, became available in 1477.
Ptolemy’s map showed the world as spherical with three
major landmasses---Europe, Asia, and Africa---and only
two oceans. In addition to showing the oceans as
considerably smaller than the landmasses, Ptolemy had
also dramatically underestimated the circumference of the
earth, which led Columbus and other adventurers to
believe that it would be feasible to sail west from Europe
to Asia.
New Horizons: The Portuguese
and Spanish Empires
Q Focus Question: How did Portugal and Spain acquire
their overseas empires, and how did their empires
differ?
Portugal took the lead in the European age of expansion
when it began to explore the coast of Africa under the
sponsorship of Prince Henry the Navigator (1394--1460).
He was driven by three primary desires: to seek a
Christian kingdom as an ally against the Muslims, to
acquire trade opportunities for Portugal, and to expand
the reach of Christianity.
The Development of a Portuguese
Maritime Empire
In 1419, Portuguese fleets began probing southward along
the western coast of Africa. Exploration slowed after
Prince Henry’s death in
1460, but Portuguese ships
gradually crept down the
African coast until Bartholomeu Dias finally rounded
the Cape of Good Hope at
the southern tip of Africa in
1488 (see Map 14.1). Ten
years later, a fleet under the
command of Vasco da Gama
rounded the cape and stopped at several ports controlled by Muslim merchants
along the coast of East Africa. Da Gama’s fleet then
crossed the Arabian Sea and
reached the port of Calicut
(today known as Kozhikode)
on the southwestern coast
of India on May 18, 1498.
Upon his arrival, da Gama
announced to his surprised
hosts that he had come in
search of ‘‘Christians and
spices.’’ He did not find the first,
but he did find the second.
Although he lost two ships en route, da Gama’s remaining
vessels returned to Europe with their holds filled with
ginger and cinnamon, a cargo that earned the investors a
profit of several thousand percent. Da Gama’s successful
voyage marked the beginning of an all-water trade route
to India. By 1501, annual Portuguese fleets to India were
making serious inroads into the Mediterranean trade of
the Venetians and Turks.
Under the direction of officials known as viceroys,
Portugal now assembled an overseas empire. Most
important of the viceroys was Alfonso d’Albuquerque
(c. 1462--1515), a tough nobleman who took the lead in
establishing a ring of commercial-military bases centered
at Goa, just north of the Malabar Coast of India. The
Portuguese also reached beyond India by taking the island
of Macao at the mouth of the Pearl River in China. The
Portuguese empire remained a limited one of small enclaves or trading posts on the coasts of India and China.
The Portuguese did not have the power, the people, or the
desire to colonize these regions.
Why were the Portuguese successful? Basically, it was
a combination of guns and seamanship. By the end of the
sixteenth century, Portuguese fleets were heavily armed
and able not only to intimidate but also to inflict severe
defeats if necessary on local naval and land forces. The
Portuguese did not possess a monopoly on the use of
firearms and explosives, but their effective use of naval
technology, heavy guns, and tactics gave them military
superiority over lightly armed rivals that they were able to
exploit until the arrival of other European forces---the
English, Dutch, and French---in the seventeenth century.
Voyages to the New World
While the Portuguese were seeking access to the spice
trade of the Indies by sailing eastward through the Indian
Ocean, the Spanish were attempting to reach the same
destination by sailing westward across the Atlantic. Although the Spanish came to overseas discovery and exploration after the initial efforts of the Portuguese, their
greater resources enabled them to establish a far grander
and quite different overseas empire.
An important figure in the history of Spanish exploration was an Italian known as Christopher Columbus
(1451--1506). Europeans were aware that the world was
round but had little understanding of its circumference or
the size of the continent of Asia. Convinced that the earth
was smaller and Asia larger than people thought, Columbus believed that Asia could be reached by sailing
directly west instead of traveling around Africa. Rebuffed
by the Portuguese, he persuaded Queen Isabella of Spain
to finance his exploratory expedition.
With three ships, the Santa Marı´a, the Nin˜a, and the
Pinta, and a crew of ninety men, Columbus set sail on
August 3, 1492. He reached the Bahamas on October 12
of that year and then went on to explore the coastline of
Cuba and the northern shores of Hispaniola (present-day
Haiti and the Dominican Republic). Columbus believed
that he had reached Asia, and in his reports to Queen
Isabella and King Ferdinand upon his return to Spain, he
assured them not only that he would eventually find gold
but also that they had a golden opportunity to convert the
natives---whom Columbus persisted in calling ‘‘Indians’’---to
Christianity. In three subsequent voyages (1493, 1498, and
1502), Columbus sought in vain to find a route to the
Asian mainland. In his four voyages, Columbus landed on
all the major islands of the Caribbean and the mainland of
Central America, still convinced that he had reached the
Indies in Asia.
Although Columbus clung to his belief until his
death, other explorers soon realized that he had discovered
a new frontier altogether. State-sponsored explorers joined
the race to the New World. AVenetian seaman, John Cabot,
explored the New England coastline of the Americas under a license from King Henry VII of England. The continent of South America was discovered accidentally by the
Portuguese sea captain Pedro Cabral in 1500. Amerigo
Vespucci, a Florentine, accompanied several voyages and
wrote a series of letters describing the geography of the
New World. The publication of these letters led to the use
of the name ‘‘America’’ (after Amerigo) for the new lands.
The first two decades of the sixteenth century witnessed numerous overseas voyages that explored the
eastern coasts of both North and South America. Perhaps
the most dramatic of all these expeditions was the journey
of Ferdinand Magellan (1480--1521) in 1519. After passing through the strait named after him at the southern tip
of South America, he sailed across the Pacific Ocean and
reached the Philippines, where he met his death at the
hands of the natives. Although only one of his original
fleet of five ships survived and returned to Spain, Magellan’s name is still associated with the first known circumnavigation of the earth.
The Europeans referred to the newly discovered territories as the New World, even though they contained
flourishing civilizations populated by millions of people.
But America was indeed new to the Europeans, who
quickly saw opportunities for conquest and exploitation.
The Spanish, in particular, were interested because the
1494 Treaty of Tordesillas had somewhat arbitrarily divided up the newly discovered world into separate Portuguese and Spanish spheres of influence, and it turned
out that most of South America fell within the Spanish
sphere. Hereafter the route east around the Cape of Good
Hope was to be reserved for the Portuguese while the
route across the Atlantic (except for the eastern hump of
South America) was assigned to Spain.
The Spanish Empire in the New World
The Spanish conquistadors were hardy individuals
motivated by a typical sixteenth-century blend of glory,
greed, and religious zeal. Although authorized by the
Castilian crown, these groups were financed and
outfitted privately, not by the government. Their superior weapons, organizational skills, and determination brought the conquistadors incredible success. They
also benefited from rivalries among the native peoples
and the decimation of the native peoples by European
diseases.
Early Civilizations in Mesoamerica Before the Spaniards arrived in the New World, Mesoamerica (modern
Mexico and Central America) had already hosted a
number of flourishing civilizations. Beginning around
A.D. 300, a people
known as the Maya
had developed on the
Yucata´n peninsula
one of the most sophisticated civilizations
in the Americas. The
Maya built splendid
temples and pyramids,
were accomplished artists, and devised a
sophisticated calendar,
as accurate as any in
existence in the world
at that time. The
Maya were an agrarian people who
cleared the dense rain
forests, farmed, and
created a patchwork of
city-states. Mayan civilization came to include much of
Central America and southern Mexico. For a number of
reasons, Mayan civilization began to decline around 800
and collapsed within a century.
Sometime during the early twelfth century A.D., a
people known as the Aztecs began a long migration that
brought them to the Valley of Mexico. They established
their capital at Tenochtitla´n, on an island in the middle of
Lake Texcoco (now the location of Mexico City). For the
next hundred years, the Aztecs built their city, constructing temples, other public buildings, houses, and causeways
of stone across Lake Texcoco to the north, south, and west,
linking the many islands to the mainland.
The Aztecs were
outstanding warriors,
and while they were
building their capital
city, they also set out
to bring the surrounding area under
their control. By the
early fifteenth century, they had become
the leading city-state
in the lake region.
During the remainder
of that century, the
Aztecs consolidated
their rule over much
of what is modern
Mexico, from the
Atlantic to the Pacific
Oceans and as far
south as the Guatemalan border. The new kingdom was
not a centralized state but a collection of semi-independent
territories governed by local lords.
The Spanish Conquest of the Aztec Empire In 1519, a
Spanish expedition under the command of Herna´n
Corte´s (1485--1547) landed at Veracruz, on the Gulf of
Mexico. He marched to the city of Tenochtitla´n (see the
box on p. 296) at the head of a small contingent of
troops (550 soldiers and 16 horses); as he went, he made
alliances with city-states that had tired of the oppressive
rule of the Aztecs. Especially important was Tlaxcala, a
state that the Aztecs had not been able to conquer. In
November, Corte´s arrived at Tenochtitla´n, where he received a friendly welcome from the Aztec monarch
Moctezuma (often called Montezuma). At first, Moctezuma believed that his visitor was a representative of
Quetzalcoatl, the god who had departed from his
homeland centuries before and had promised someday
to return.
But the Spaniards quickly wore out their welcome.
The took Moctezuma hostage and proceeded to pillage
the city. In the fall of 1520, one year after Corte´s had
arrived, the local population revolted and drove the
invaders from the city. Many of the Spaniards were
killed, but the Aztecs soon experienced new disasters.
As one Aztec related, ‘‘At about the time that the
Spaniards had fled from Mexico, there came a great
sickness, a pestilence, the smallpox.’’ With no natural
immunity to the diseases of Europe, many Aztecs fell
sick and died. Meanwhile, Corte´s received fresh soldiers
from his new allies; the state of Tlaxcala alone provided
fifty thousand warriors. After four months, the city capitulated. And then the destruction began. The pyramids, temples, and palaces were leveled, and the stones
were used to build Spanish government buildings and
churches. The rivers and canals were filled in. The
mighty Aztec Empire on mainland Mexico was no more.
Between 1531 and 1550, the Spanish gained control of
northern Mexico.
The Inca and the Spanish In the late fourteenth century, the Inca were a small community in the area of
Cuzco, a city located at an altitude of 10,000 feet in the
mountains of southern Peru. In the 1440s, however, under the leadership of their powerful ruler Pachakuti, the
Inca launched a campaign of conquest that eventually
brought the entire region under their control.
Pachakuti created a highly centralized state. The
capital of Cuzco was transformed from a city of mud and
thatch into an imposing city of stone. Under Pachakuti
and his immediate successors, Topa Inca and Huayna
Inca (the word inca means ‘‘ruler’’), the boundaries of the
Inca Empire were extended as far as Ecuador, central
Chile, and the edge of the Amazon basin. The empire
included perhaps twelve million people.
The Inca were great builders. One major project was
a system of 24,800 miles of roads that extended from the
border of modern-day Colombia to a point south of
modern-day Santiago, Chile. Two major roadways extended in a north-south direction, one through the Andes
Mountains and the other along the coast, with connecting
routes between them. Various types of bridges, including
some of the finest examples of suspension bridges in
premodern times, were built over ravines and waterways.
The Inca Empire was still flourishing when the first
Spanish expeditions arrived in the area. In December
1530, Francisco Pizarro (c. 1475--1541) landed on the
Pacific coast of South America with a band of about 180
men, but like Corte´s, he had steel weapons, gunpowder,
and horses, none of which were familiar to the natives.
Pizarro was also lucky because the Inca Empire had already succumbed to an epidemic of smallpox. Like the
Aztecs, the Inca had no immunities to European diseases,
and all too soon, smallpox was devastating entire villages.
In another stroke of good fortune for Pizarro, even the
Incan emperor was a victim. Upon the emperor’s death,
two sons claimed the throne, leading to a civil war. Pizarro took advantage of the situation by seizing Atahualpa, whose forces had just defeated his brother’s.
Armed only with stones, arrows, and light spears, Incan
soldiers could mount little resistance to the charging
horses of the Spanish, let alone their guns and cannons.
After executing Atahualpa, Pizarro and his soldiers, aided
by their Incan allies, marched on Cuzco and captured the
Incan capital. By 1535, Pizarro had established a capital at
Lima for a new colony of the Spanish Empire.
Administration of the Spanish Empire Spanish policy
toward the native peoples of the New World was a
combination of confusion, misguided paternalism, and
cruel exploitation. Whereas the conquistadors made decisions based on expediency and their own interests,
Queen Isabella declared the natives to be subjects of
Castile and instituted the Spanish encomienda, a system
that permitted the conquering Spaniards to collect tribute
from the natives and use them as laborers. In return, the
holders of an encomienda were supposed to protect the
Indians, pay them wages, and supervise their spiritual
needs. In practice, this meant that the settlers were free to
implement the paternalistic system of the government as
they pleased. Three thousand miles from Spain, Spanish
settlers largely ignored their government and brutally
used the Indians to pursue their own economic interests.
Indians were put to work on plantations and in the lucrative gold and silver mines. In Peru, the Spanish made
use of the mita, a system that allowed authorities to draft
native labor to work in the silver mines.
Forced labor, starvation, and especially disease took a
fearful toll of Indian lives. The natives were ravaged by the
smallpox, measles, and typhus that arrived with the explorers and the conquistadors---perhaps 30 to 40 percent
of them died. Hispaniola was badly devastated: of an
initial population of 100,000 when Columbus landed in
1493, only 300 natives survived by 1570.
In the New World, the Spanish developed an administrative system based on viceroys. Spanish possessions
were initially divided into two major administrative units:
New Spain (Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean
islands), with its center at Mexico City, and Peru (western
South America), governed by a viceroy in Lima. Each
viceroy served as the king’s chief civil and military officer.
By papal agreement, the Catholic monarchs of Spain
were given extensive rights over ecclesiastical affairs in the
New World. They could appoint all bishops and clergy,
build churches, collect fees, and supervise the affairs of
the various religious orders that sought to Christianize
the heathen. Catholic missionaries---especially the Dominicans, Franciscans, and Jesuits---fanned out across the
Spanish Empire, where they converted and baptized
hundreds of thousands of Indians in the early years of the
conquest. Soon after the missionaries came the establishment of dioceses, parishes, cathedrals, schools, and
hospitals---all the trappings of civilized European society.
New Rivals on the World Stage
Q Focus Questions: How did the arrival of the Dutch,
British, and French on the world scene in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries affect Africa,
India, Southeast Asia, China, and Japan? What were
the main features of the African slave trade, and what
effects did it have on Africa?
Portugal and Spain had been the first Atlantic nations to
take advantage of the Age of Exploration, starting in the
late fifteenth century, and both had become great colonial
powers. In the seventeenth century, however, their European
neighbors to the north---first the Dutch and then the French
and British---moved to replace the Portuguese and Spanish
and forge their own colonial empires. This new rivalry
soon had an impact on much of the rest of the world---in
Africa, Asia, and the Americas.
Africa: The Slave Trade
Although the primary objective of the Portuguese in
sailing around Africa was to find a sea route to the Spice
Islands, they soon discovered that profits could be made
in Africa itself. So did other Europeans who also realized
the financial benefits of trade in slaves.
Traffic in slaves was not new, and at first, the Portuguese simply replaced European slaves with African ones.
During the second half of the fifteenth century, about a
thousand slaves were taken to Portugal each year. Most
wound up serving as domestic servants for affluent families
in Europe. But the discovery of the Americas in the 1490s
and the planting of sugarcane in South America and on the
islands of the Caribbean changed the situation drastically.
Cane sugar had first been introduced to Europeans
from the Middle East during the Crusades. During the
sixteenth century, sugarcane plantations were set up along
the eastern coast of Brazil and on several islands in the
Caribbean. Because the growing of cane sugar demands
both skill and large quantities of labor, the new plantations required more workers than could be provided by
the small native population in the New World, decimated
by diseases imported from the Old World. Since the climate and soil of much of West Africa were not conducive
to the cultivation of sugar, African slaves began to be
shipped to Brazil and the Caribbean to work on the
plantations. The first were sent from Portugal, but in
1518, a Spanish ship carried the first boatload of African
slaves directly from Africa to the New World.
Growth in the Slave Trade During the next two centuries, the trade in slaves grew dramatically and became
part of the triangular trade that characterized the new
Atlantic economy connecting Europe, Africa, and the
American continents (see Map 14.2). European merchant
ships (primarily those of Britain, France, Spain, Portugal,
and the Dutch Republic) carried European manufactured
goods, such as guns, gin, and cloth, to Africa, where they
were traded for cargoes of slaves. The slaves were then
shipped to the Americas and sold. European merchants
then bought tobacco, molasses, sugar, rum, coffee, and
raw cotton and shipped them back to Europe to be sold
in European markets.
An estimated 275,000 enslaved Africans were exported to other countries during the sixteenth century,
with two thousand going annually to the Americas. In the
seventeenth century, the total climbed to over a million
and jumped to six million in the eighteenth century,
when the trade spread from West and Central Africa to
East Africa. Altogether as many as ten million African
slaves were transported to the Americas between the early
sixteenth and nineteenth centuries.
One reason for the astonishing numbers of slaves, of
course, was the high death rate. The arduous journey of
slaves from Africa to the Americas became known as the
Middle Passage, the middle leg of
the triangular trade route. African
slaves were closely packed into
cargo ships, 300 to 450 per ship,
and chained in holds without sanitary facilities or enough space to
stand up; there they remained during the voyage to America, which
took at least 100 days (see the box
on p. 300). Mortality rates averaged
10 percent; longer journeys due to
storms or adverse winds resulted in
even higher death rates. The Africans who survived the journey were
subject to high death rates from
diseases to which they had little or
no immunity.
Before the coming of Europeans in the fifteenth century, most
slaves in Africa were prisoners of
war. When Europeans first began to
take part in the slave trade, they
bought slaves from local African
merchants at slave markets in return
for gold, guns, or other European
goods such as textiles or copper or
iron utensils.
Local slave traders originally
obtained their supply from regions
nearby, but as demand increased,
they had to move farther inland to
find their victims. In a few cases,
local rulers became concerned
about the impact of the slave trade
on the well-being of their societies.
In a letter to the king of Portugal in
1526, King Affonso of Congo (Bakongo) complained, ‘‘So
great, Sire, is the corruption and licentiousness that our
country is being completely depopulated.’’4 Protests from
Africans were generally ignored by Europeans as well as
by other Africans.
Effects of the Slave Trade The effects of the slave trade
varied from area to area. Of course, it had tragic effects on
the lives of the slaves and their families. There was also an
economic price as the importation of cheap manufactured goods from Europe undermined local cottage industries and forced countless families into poverty. The
slave trade also led to the depopulation of some areas and
deprived many African communities of their youngest
and strongest men and women.
The political effects of the slave trade were devastating. The need to maintain a constant supply of slaves
led to increased warfare and violence as African chiefs and
their followers, armed with guns acquired from the proceeds of the trade in slaves, increased their raids and wars
on neighboring peoples. A few Europeans lamented what
they were doing to traditional African societies. One
Dutch slave trader remarked, ‘‘From us they have learned
strife, quarrelling, drunkenness, trickery, theft, unbridled
desire for what is not one’s own, misdeeds unknown to
them before, and the accursed lust for gold.’’5 But the
slave trade continued unabated.
Despite a rising chorus of humanitarian sentiments
from European intellectuals, the use of black slaves remained largely acceptable to Western society. Europeans
continued to view blacks as inferior beings fit primarily
for indentured labor. Not until the Society of Friends,
known as the Quakers, began to criticize slavery in the
1770s and exclude from their church any member adhering to slave trafficking did European sentiment against
slavery begin to build. Even then, it was not until the
radical stage of the French Revolution in the 1790s that
the French abolished slavery. The British followed suit in
1807. Despite the elimination of the African source,
slavery continued in the newly formed United States until
the 1860s.
The West in Southeast Asia
Portugal’s efforts to dominate the trade of Southeast Asia
were never totally successful. The Portuguese lacked both
the numbers and the wealth to overcome local resistance
and colonize the Asian regions. Portugal’s empire was
simply too large and Portugal too small to maintain it. By
the end of the sixteenth century, new European rivals had
entered the fray.
One of them was Spain. The Spanish had established
themselves in the region when Magellan had landed in the
Philippines. Although he was killed there, the Spanish
were able to gain control over the Philippines, which
eventually became a major Spanish base in the trade
across the Pacific. Spanish ships carried silk and other
luxury goods to Mexico in return for silver from the
mines of Mexico.
The primary threat to the
Portuguese Empire in Southeast Asia, however, came with
the arrival of the Dutch and
the English, who were better
financed than the Portuguese.
The shift in power began in
the early seventeenth century
when the Dutch seized a Portuguese fort in the Moluccas
and then gradually pushed the
Portuguese out of the spice
trade. During the next fifty
years, the Dutch occupied
most of the Portuguese coastal
forts along the trade routes throughout the Indian Ocean,
including the island of Ceylon (today’s Sri Lanka) and
Malacca. The aggressive Dutch drove the English traders
out of the spice market as well.
The Dutch also began to
consolidate their political and
military control over the entire area. On the island of
Java, where they had established a fort at Batavia
(modern Jakarta) in 1619, the
Dutch found that it was necessary to bring the inland regions under their control to
protect their position. On
Java and the neighboring island of Sumatra, the Dutch
East India Company established pepper plantations,
which soon became the source of massive profits for
Dutch merchants in Amsterdam. By the end of the
eighteenth century, the Dutch had succeeded in bringing
almost the entire Indonesian archipelago under their
control.
The arrival of the Europeans had less impact on
mainland Southeast Asia, where strong monarchies in
Burma (modern Myanmar), Siam (modern Thailand),
and Vietnam resisted foreign encroachment. In the sixteenth century, the Portuguese established limited trade
relations with several mainland states, including Siam,
Burma, Vietnam, and the remnants of the old Angkor
kingdom in Cambodia. By the early seventeenth century,
other nations had followed and had begun to compete
actively for trade and missionary privileges. In general,
however, these states were able to unite and drive the
Europeans out.
In Vietnam, the arrival of Western merchants and
missionaries coincided with a period of internal conflict
among ruling groups in the country. After their arrival
in the mid-seventeenth century, the European powers
began to take sides in local politics, with the Portuguese
and the Dutch supporting rival factions. The Europeans
also set up trading posts for their merchants, but by the
end of the seventeenth century, when it became clear
that economic opportunities were limited, most of them
were abandoned. French missionaries attempted to remain, but their efforts were blocked by the authorities,
who viewed converts to Catholicism as a threat to the
prestige of the Vietnamese emperor (see the box on
p. 303).
The French and British in India
When a Portuguese fleet arrived at the port of Calicut in
the spring of 1498, the Indian subcontinent was divided
into a number of Hindu and Muslim kingdoms. But it
was on the verge of a new era of unity that would be
brought about by a foreign dynasty called the Mughals.
The Mughal Empire The founders of the Mughal Empire were not natives of India but came from the
mountainous region north of the Ganges River valley.
The founder of the dynasty, Babur, had an illustrious
background. His father was descended from the great
Asian conqueror Tamerlane; his mother, from the Mongol conqueror Genghis Khan. It was Akbar, Babur’s
grandson, however, who brought Mughal rule to most of
India, creating the greatest Indian empire since the
Mauryan dynasty nearly two thousand years earlier.
The Impact of the Western Powers As we have seen,
the first Europeans to arrive in India were the Portuguese.
At first, Portugal dominated regional trade in the Indian
Ocean, but at the end of the sixteenth century, the British
and the Dutch arrived on the scene. Soon both powers
were competing with Portugal, and with each other, for
trading privileges in the region.
During the first half of the seventeenth century, the
British presence in India steadily increased. By 1650,
British trading posts had been established at Surat
(a thriving port along the northwestern coast of India),
Fort William (later the great city of Calcutta, modern
Kolkata) near the Bay of Bengal, and Madras (known
today as Chennai) on the southeastern coast. From Madras, British ships carried Indian-made cotton goods to
the East Indies, where they were bartered for spices, which
were shipped back to Britain.
British success in India attracted rivals, including
the Dutch and the French. The Dutch abandoned their
interests to concentrate on the spice trade in the middle
of the seventeenth century, but the French were more
persistent and established their own forts on the east
coast. For a brief period, the French competed successfully with the British, even capturing the British fort
at Madras.
But the British were saved by the military genius of
Sir Robert Clive (1725--1774), an aggressive British
empire-builder who became the chief representative in
India of the East India Company, which had been
founded in 1600. Eventually, the French were restricted
to the fort at Pondicherry (modern Puducherry) and a
handful of small territories on the southeastern coast.
In the meantime, Clive began to consolidate British
control in Bengal, where the local ruler had attacked Fort
William and imprisoned the local British population in
the ‘‘Black Hole of Calcutta’’ (an underground prison for
holding the prisoners, many of whom died in captivity).
In 1757, a small British force numbering about three
thousand men defeated a Mughal-led army more than ten
times its size in the Battle of Plassey. As part of the spoils
of victory, the British East India Company received from
the now-decrepit Mughal court the authority to collect
taxes from lands in the area surrounding Calcutta. During
the Seven Years’ War (1756--1763), the British forced the
French to withdraw completely from India (see Chapter 18).
China
In 1514, a Portuguese fleet dropped anchor off the coast
of China. At the time, the Chinese thought little of the
event. China appeared to be at the height of its power as
the most magnificent civilization on the face of the earth.
Its empire stretched from the steppes of Central Asia to
the China Sea, from the Gobi Desert to the tropical rain
forests of Southeast Asia. From the lofty perspective of the
imperial throne in Beijing, the Europeans could only be
seen as an unusual form of barbarian. To the Chinese
ruler, the rulers of all other countries were simply
‘‘younger brothers’’ of the Chinese emperor, who was
viewed as the Son of Heaven.
By the time the Portuguese fleet arrived off the coast
of China, the Ming dynasty, which ruled from 1369 to
1644, had already begun a new era of greatness in Chinese
history. Under a series of strong rulers, China extended its
rule into Mongolia and Central Asia. The Ming even
briefly reconquered Vietnam. Along the northern frontier,
they strengthened the Great Wall and made peace with
the nomadic tribesmen who had troubled China for
centuries.
But the days of the Ming dynasty were numbered.
After a period of prosperity and growth, the Ming
gradually began to decline. During the late sixteenth
century, a series of weak rulers led to a period of government corruption. As always, internal problems went
hand in hand with unrest along the northern frontier. The
Ming had tried to come to terms with the frontier tribes
by making alliances with them. One of the alliances was
with the Manchus, who lived northeast of the Great Wall
in the area known today as Manchuria. In 1644, the
Manchus overthrew the last Ming
emperor and declared the creation
of a new dynasty with the reign title
of the Qing (Ch’ing, ‘‘Pure’’). The
Qing were blessed with a series of
strong early rulers who pacified the
country, corrected the most serious
social and economic ills, and restored peace and prosperity. Two
Qing monarchs, Kangxi and Qianlong, ruled China for well over a
century, from the middle of the
seventeenth century to the end of
the eighteenth. They were responsible for much of the greatness of
Manchu China.
Western Inroads Although China was at the height of
its power and glory in the mid-eighteenth century, the
first signs of the internal decay of the Manchu dynasty
were beginning to appear. Unfortunately for China, the
decline of the Qing dynasty occurred just as Europe was
increasing pressure for more trade. The first conflict had
come from the north, where Russian traders sought skins
and furs. Formal diplomatic relations between China and
Russia were established in 1689 and provided for regular
trade between the two countries.
Dealing with the foreigners who arrived by sea was more
difficult. By the end of the seventeenth century, the English
had replaced the Portuguese as the dominant force in European trade. Operating through the East India Company,
which served as both a trading unit and the administrator
of English territories in Asia, the English established their
first trading post at Canton (modern Guangzhou) in 1699.
Over the next decades, trade with China, notably the export of tea and silk to England, increased rapidly. To limit
contacts between Europeans and Chinese, the Qing government confined all European traders to a small island
just outside the city walls of Canton and permitted them
to reside there only from October through March.
By the end of the eighteenth century, some British
traders had begun to demand access to other cities along
the Chinese coast and insist that the country be opened to
British manufactured goods. In 1793, a British mission
under Lord Macartney visited Beijing to press for liberalization of trade restrictions. But Emperor Qianlong
expressed no interest in British products. The Chinese
would later pay for their rejection of the British request
(see Chapter 24).
Japan
At the end of the fifteenth century, Japan was at a point of
near anarchy, but in the course of the sixteenth century, a
number of powerful individuals
achieved the unification of Japan.
One of them, Tokugawa Ieyasu
(1543--1616), took the title of shogun
(‘‘general’’) in 1603, an act that initiated the most powerful and longestlasting of all the Japanese shogunates.
The Tokugawa rulers completed the
restoration of central authority and
remained in power until 1868.
Opening to the West Portuguese
traders had landed on the islands of
Japan in 1543, and in a few years,
Portuguese ships began stopping at
Japanese ports on a regular basis to
take part in the regional trade between Japan, China, and
Southeast Asia. The first Jesuit missionary, Francis Xavier,
arrived in 1549 and had some success in converting the
local population to Christianity.
Initially, the visitors were welcomed. The curious
Japanese were fascinated by tobacco, clocks, eyeglasses,
and other European goods, and local nobles were interested in purchasing all types of European weapons and
armaments. Japanese rulers found the new firearms especially helpful in defeating their enemies and unifying
the islands.
The success of Catholic missionaries, however, created a strong reaction against the presence of Westerners.
When missionaries began to interfere in local politics,
Tokugawa Ieyasu, newly come to power, expelled them all
and sanctioned the persecution of Japanese Christians.
European merchants
were the next to go. The
government closed the
two major foreign trading
posts on the island of
Hirado and at Nagasaki.
Only a small Dutch
community in Nagasaki
was allowed to remain in
Japan. The Dutch, unlike
the Spanish and Portuguese, had not allowed
missionary activities to
interfere with their trade
interests. But the conditions
for staying were strict. Dutch ships were allowed to dock
at Nagasaki harbor once a year and could remain for only
two to three months.
The Americas
In the sixteenth century, Spain and Portugal had established large colonial empires in the Americas. Portugal
continued to profit from its empire in Brazil. The Spanish
also maintained an enormous South American empire,
but Spain’s importance as a commercial power declined
rapidly in the seventeenth century because of a drop in
the output of the silver mines and the poverty of the
Spanish monarchy. By the start of the seventeenth century, both Portugal and Spain found themselves facing
new challenges to their American empires from the
Dutch, British, and French,
who increasingly sought to
create their own colonial
empires in the New World.
The West Indies Both
the French and British
colonial empires in the
New World included large
parts of the West Indies.
The British held Barbados,
Jamaica, and Bermuda,
and the French possessed
Saint-Domingue, Martinique, and Guadeloupe.
On these tropical islands, both the British and the French
had developed plantation economies, worked by African
slaves, that produced tobacco, cotton, coffee, and sugar,
all products increasingly in demand in Europe.
The ‘‘sugar factories,’’ as the sugar plantations in the
Caribbean were called, played an especially prominent
role. By the 1780s, Jamaica, one of Britain’s most important colonies, was producing 50,000 tons of sugar
annually with the slave labor of 200,000 blacks. The
French colony of Saint-Domingue (later known as Haiti)
had 500,000 slaves working on three thousand plantations
at the same time. This colony produced 100,000 tons of
sugar a year, but at the expense of a high death rate from
the brutal treatment of the slaves.
British North America The Dutch were among the first
to establish settlements on the North American continent
after Henry Hudson, an English explorer hired by the
Dutch, discovered in 1609 the river that bears his name.
Within a few years, the Dutch had established the
mainland colony of New Netherlands, which stretched
from the mouth of the Hudson River as far north as
Albany, New York. After 1650, competition from the
English and French and years of warfare with those rivals
led to the decline of the Dutch commercial empire. In
1664, the English seized the colony of New Netherlands
and renamed it New York.
In the meantime, the British had begun to establish
their own colonies in North America. The first permanent
English settlement in America was Jamestown, founded
in 1607 in modern Virginia. It barely survived, making it
clear that the colonizing of American lands was not
necessarily conducive to quick profits. But the desire to
practice one’s own religion, combined with economic
interests, could lead to successful colonization, as the
Massachusetts Bay Company demonstrated. The Massachusetts colony had four thousand settlers in its early
years but by 1660 had swelled to forty thousand. By the
end of the seventeenth century, the English had established control over most of the eastern seaboard of the
present United States.
British North America came to consist of thirteen
colonies. They were thickly populated, containing about
1.5 million people by 1750, and prosperous. Ostensibly
run by the British Board of Trade, the Royal Council, and
Parliament, these thirteen colonies had legislatures that
tended to act independently. Merchants in such port cities
as Boston, Philadelphia, New York, and Charleston resented
and resisted regulation from the British government.
French North America The French also established a
colonial empire in North America. In 1663, Canada was
made the property of the French crown and administered
by a French governor like a French province.
French North America was run autocratically as a vast
trading area, where valuable furs, leather, fish, and timber
were acquired. However, the inability of the French government to get people to emigrate to its Canadian possessions left them thinly populated. By 1750, there were
about fifteen thousand French Canadians, most of whom
were hunters, trappers, missionaries, and explorers. The
French failed to provide adequate men or money, allowing
their Continental wars to take precedence over the conquest of the North American continent.
The Impact of European
Expansion
Q Focus Question: How did European expansion affect
both the conquerors and the conquered?
Between 1500 and 1800, the Atlantic nations of Europe
moved into all parts of the world. The first had been
Spain and Portugal, the two great colonial powers of the
sixteenth century, followed by the Dutch, who built their
colonial empire in the seventeenth century as Portugal
and Spain declined. The Dutch were soon challenged by
the British and French, who outstripped the others in the
eighteenth century while becoming involved in a bitter
rivalry. By the end of the eighteenth century, it appeared
that Britain would become the great European imperial
power. European expansion had an enormous impact on
both the conquerors and the conquered.
The Conquered
The native American civilizations, which had their own
unique qualities and a degree of sophistication not much
appreciated by Europeans, were virtually destroyed. In
addition to massive losses of population due to European
diseases, ancient social and political structures were ripped up and replaced by European institutions, religion,
language, and culture. In Africa, European involvement in
the slave trade had devastating effects, especially in coastal
areas. The Portuguese trading posts in the East had little
impact on native Asian civilizations, although Dutch control
of the Indonesian archipelago was more intrusive. China
and Japan were still little affected by Westerners, although
India was subject to ever-growing British encroachment.
In Central and South America, a new civilization
arose that we have come to call Latin America. It was a
multiracial society. Spanish and Portuguese settlers who
arrived in the Western Hemisphere were few in number
compared to the native Indians; many of the newcomers
were males who not only used female natives for their
sexual pleasure but married them as well. Already by
1501, Spanish rulers had authorized intermarriage between Europeans and native American Indians, whose
offspring became known as mestizos. Another group of
people brought to Latin America were the Africans. Over
a period of three centuries, possibly as many as eight
million slaves were brought to Spanish and Portuguese
America to work the plantations. Africans also contributed to Latin America’s multiracial character. Mulattoes---
the offspring of Africans and whites---joined mestizos and
descendants of whites, Africans, and native Indians to
produce a unique society in Latin America. Unlike Europe or British North America, Latin America developed
a multihued society with less rigid attitudes about race.
The ecology of conquered areas was also affected by
the European presence. Europeans brought horses and
cattle to the Americas. Horses revolutionized the life of
the Plains Indians. Europeans brought new crops, such as
wheat and cane sugar, to be cultivated on large plantations by native or imported slave labor. In their trips to
other parts of the world, Europeans also carried New
World plants with them. Thus Europeans introduced
sweet potatoes and maize (Indian corn) to Africa in the
sixteenth century.
Catholic Missionaries Although there were some
Protestant missionaries in the world outside Europe,
Catholic missionaries were far more active in spreading
Christianity. From the beginning of their conquest of the
New World, Spanish and Portuguese rulers were determined to Christianize the native peoples. This policy gave
the Catholic church an important role to play in the New
World, one that added considerably to church power.
Catholic missionaries---especially the Dominicans, Franciscans, and Jesuits---fanned out to different parts of the
Spanish Empire.
To facilitate their efforts, missionaries brought Indians together into villages, where the natives could be
converted, taught trades, and encouraged to grow crops.
These missions enabled the missionaries to control the
lives of the Indians and helped ensure that they would
remain docile members of the empire (see the box on
p. 308). Basically, missions benefited the missionaries
more than the Indians. In frontier districts such as California and Texas, missions also served as military barriers
to foreign encroachment.
The Catholic church constructed hospitals, orphanages, and schools. Monastic schools instructed Indian
students in the rudiments of reading, writing, and
arithmetic. The Catholic church also provided outlets for
women other than marriage. Nunneries were places of
prayer and quiet contemplation, but women in religious
orders, many of them of aristocratic background, often
lived well and worked outside their establishments by
running schools and hospitals. Indeed, one of these nuns,
Sor Juana Ine´s de la Cruz (1651--1695), was one of
seventeenth-century Latin America’s best-known literary
figures. She wrote poetry and prose and urged that women
be educated.
Christian missionaries had also made the long voyage
to China on European merchant ships. The Jesuits were
among the most active and the most effective. Many of
the early Jesuit missionaries to China were highly educated
men who were familiar with European philosophical and
scientific developments. They brought along clocks and
various other instruments that impressed Chinese officials
and made them more open to Western ideas.
The Jesuits used this openness to promote Christianity. To make it easier for the Chinese to accept
Christianity, the Jesuits pointed to similarities between
Christian morality and Confucian ethics. The efforts of
the Christian missionaries reached their height in the
early eighteenth century. Several hundred Chinese officials became Catholics, as did an estimated 300,000 ordinary Chinese. But ultimately the Christian effort was
undermined by squabbling among the religious orders
themselves. To make it easier for the Chinese to convert,
the Jesuits had allowed the new Catholics to continue the
practice of ancestor worship. Jealous Dominicans and
Franciscans complained to the pope, who condemned the
practice. Soon Chinese authorities began to suppress
Christian activities throughout China.
The Jesuits also had some success in Japan, where
they converted a number of local nobles. By the end of
the sixteenth century, thousands of Japanese on the
southernmost islands of Kyushu and Shikoku had become Christians. But the Jesuit practice of destroying
local idols and shrines and turning some temples into
Christian schools or churches caused a severe reaction.
When a new group of Spanish Franciscans continued the
same policies, the government ordered the execution of
nine missionaries and a number of their Japanese converts.
The Conquerors
For some Europeans, expansion abroad brought hopes
for land, riches, and social advancement. One Spaniard
commented in 1572 that many ‘‘poor young men’’ left
Spain for Mexico, where they might hope to acquire
landed estates and call themselves ‘‘gentlemen.’’ Although
some wives accompanied their husbands abroad, many
ordinary European women found new opportunities for
marriage in the New World because of the lack of white
women. Indeed, as one commentator bluntly put it, even
‘‘a whore, if handsome, [can] make a wife for some rich
planter.’’6 In the violence-prone world of early Spanish
America, a number of women also found themselves rich
after their husbands were killed unexpectedly. In one area
of Central America, women owned about 25 percent of
the landed estates by 1700.
European expansion also had other economic effects
on the conquerors. Wherever they went in the New World,
Europeans sought to find sources of gold and silver. One
Aztec commented that the Spanish conquerors ‘‘longed
and lusted for gold. Their bodies swelled with greed, and
their hunger was ravenous; they hungered like pigs for
that gold.’’7 Rich silver deposits were found and exploited
in Mexico and southern Peru (modern Bolivia). When the
mines at Potosı´ in Peru were opened in 1545, the value of
precious metals imported into Europe quadrupled. Between 1503 and 1650, nearly 18,000 tons of silver and
more than 200 tons of gold entered the port of Seville,
setting off a price revolution in the Spanish economy.
But gold and silver were only two of the products
that became part of the exchange between the New World
and the Old. Historians refer to the reciprocal importation and exportation of plants and animals between Europe and the Americas as the Columbian Exchange.
While Europeans were bringing horses, cattle, and wheat
to the New World, they were taking new agricultural
products such as potatoes, chocolate, corn, tomatoes, and
tobacco back to Europe. Potatoes became especially
popular as a basic dietary staple in some areas of Europe.
High in carbohydrates and rich in vitamins A and C,
potatoes could be easily stored for winter use and soon
enabled more people to survive on smaller plots of land.
This improvement in nutrition was soon reflected in a
rapid increase in population.
The European lifestyle was greatly affected by new
products from abroad. In addition to new foods, new drinks
also appeared in Europe. Chocolate, which had been brought
to Spain from Aztec Mexico, became a common drink by
1700. The first coffee and tea houses opened in London in the
1650s and spread rapidly to other parts of Europe. In the
eighteenth century, a craze for Chinese furniture and porcelain spread among the upper classes. Chinese ideas would also
make an impact on intellectual attitudes (see Chapter 17).
European expansion, which
was in part a product of European rivalries, also deepened
those rivalries and increased
the tensions among European
states. Bitter conflicts arose
over the cargoes coming from
the New World and Asia. The
Anglo-Dutch trade wars and
the British-French rivalry over
India and North America became part of a new pattern of
worldwide warfare in the eighteenth century (see Chapter 18). Bitter rivalries also led
to state-sponsored piracy in
which governments authorized private captains to attack
enemy shipping and keep part
of the proceeds for themselves.
In the course of their expansion, Europeans also came
to have a new view of the
world. When the travels began
in the fifteenth century, Europeans were dependent on maps
that were often fanciful and
inaccurate. Their explorations helped them draw new maps
that gave a more realistic portrayal of the world, as well as
devise new techniques called map projections that allowed
them to represent the round surface of a sphere on a flat
piece of paper. The most famous of these is the Mercator
projection, the work of a Flemish cartographer, Gerardus
Mercator (1512--1594). Mercator is what mapmakers call
a conformal projection, which tries to show the true shape
of landmasses, but only of a limited area. On the Mercator
projection, the shapes of lands near the equator are quite
accurate, but the farther away from the equator they lie, the
more exaggerated their size becomes. Nevertheless, the
Mercator projection was valuable to ship captains. Every
straight line on a Mercator projection is a line of true direction, whether north, south, east, or west. For four centuries, ship captains were very grateful to Mercator.
The psychological impact of colonization on the colonizers is awkward to evaluate but hard to deny. Europeans
were initially startled by the discovery of new peoples in
the Americas. Some deemed them inhuman and thus fit
to be exploited for labor. Others, however, found them to
be refreshingly natural and not yet touched by European
corruption. But even most members of the latter group
believed that the Indians should be converted---if not
forcefully, at least peacefully---to Christianity. Overall, the
relatively easy European success in dominating native
peoples (in Africa as well as America) reinforced Christian
Europe’s belief in the inherent superiority of European
civilization and religion. The Scientific Revolution of the
seventeenth century (see Chapter 16), the Enlightenment
of the eighteenth (see Chapter 17), and the imperialism of
the nineteenth (see Chapter 24) would all bolster this
Eurocentric perspective, which has pervaded Western civilization’s relationship with the rest of the world.
Toward a World Economy
Q Focus Question: What was mercantilism, and what
was its relationship to colonial empires?
During the High Middle Ages, Europeans had engaged in
a commercial revolution that created new opportunities
for townspeople in a basically agrarian economy. Although
this commercial thrust was slowed by the crises of the
fourteenth century, Europe’s discovery of the world outside
in the fifteenth century led to an even greater burst of
commercial activity and the inception of a world market.
Economic Conditions in the Sixteenth Century
Inflation was a major economic problem in the sixteenth
and early seventeenth centuries. This so-called price
revolution was a Europe-wide phenomenon, although
different areas were affected at different times. Foodstuffs
were most subject to price increases. But wages failed to
keep up with the rise in prices. Wage earners, especially
agricultural laborers and salaried workers in urban areas,
saw their standard of living drop. At the same time,
landed aristocrats, who could raise rents, managed to
prosper. Commercial and industrial entrepreneurs also
benefited from the price revolution because of rising
prices, expanding markets, and relatively cheaper labor
costs. Some historians regard this profit inflation as a
valuable stimulus to investment and the growth of capitalism, laying the groundwork for the economic expansion
and prosperity of the sixteenth century. Governments
were likewise affected by inflation. They borrowed heavily
from bankers and imposed new tax burdens on their
subjects, often stirring additional discontent.
The Growth of Commercial Capitalism
The flourishing European trade of the sixteenth century
revolved around three major areas: the Mediterranean in
the south, the Low Countries and the Baltic region in the
north, and central Europe, whose inland trade depended
on the Rhine and Danube Rivers. As overseas trade expanded, however, the Atlantic seaboard began to play a
more important role, linking all three trading areas together and making Europe into a more integrated market
that was all the more vulnerable to price shifts.
The commercial expansion of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was made easier by new forms of commercial organization, especially the joint-stock company.
Individuals bought shares in a company and received dividends on their investment while a board of directors ran the
company and made the important business decisions. The
return on investments could be spectacular. During its first
ten years, investors received 30 percent altogether on their
money from the Dutch East India Company, which opened
the Spice Islands and Southeast Asia to Dutch activity. The
joint-stock company made it easier to raise large amounts of
capital for world trading ventures.
Traditional family banking firms were no longer able
to supply the numerous services needed for the commercial capitalism of the seventeenth century, and new
institutions arose to take their place. In 1609, the city of
Amsterdam created the Bank of Amsterdam as both a
depository and a transfer institution and established the
Amsterdam Bourse, or Exchange, where the trading of
stocks replaced the exchange of goods. By the first half of
the seventeenth century, the Amsterdam Exchange had
emerged as the hub of the European business world, just
as Amsterdam had replaced Antwerp as the major commercial and banking center of Europe.
Despite the growth of commercial capitalism, most
of the European economy still depended on an agricultural system that had experienced few changes since the
thirteenth century. At least 80 percent of Europeans still
worked on the land. Almost all of the peasants of western
Europe were free of serfdom, although many still owed a
variety of feudal dues to the nobility. Despite the expanding markets and rising prices, European peasants saw
little or no improvement in their lot as they faced increased
rents and fees and higher taxes imposed by the state.
Mercantilism
Mercantilism is the name historians use to identify a set
of economic tendencies that came to dominate economic
practices in the seventeenth century. Fundamental to
mercantilism was the belief that the total volume of trade
was unchangeable. Since one nation could expand its
trade and hence its prosperity only at the expense of
others, to mercantilists, economic activity was war carried
on by peaceful means.
According to the mercantilists, the prosperity of a
nation depended on a plentiful supply of bullion, or gold
and silver. For this reason, it was desirable to achieve a
favorable balance of trade in which goods exported were
of greater value than those imported, promoting an influx
of gold and silver payments that would increase the
quantity of bullion. Furthermore, to encourage exports,
governments should stimulate and protect export industries and trade by granting trade monopolies, encouraging
investment in new industries through subsidies, importing
foreign artisans, and improving transportation systems by
building roads, bridges, and canals. By placing high tariffs
on foreign goods, they could be kept out of the country
and prevented from competing with domestic industries.
Colonies were also deemed valuable as sources of raw
materials and markets for finished goods.
Mercantilism focused on the role of the state, believing that state intervention in some aspects of the
economy was desirable for the sake of the national good.
Government regulations to ensure the superiority of
export goods, the construction of roads and canals, and
the granting of subsidies to create trade companies were
all predicated on government involvement in economic
affairs.
Overseas Trade and Colonies:
Movement Toward Globalization
Mercantilist theory on the role of colonies was matched
in practice by Europe’s overseas expansion. With the
development of colonies and trading posts in the Americas and the East, Europeans embarked on an adventure
in international commerce in the seventeenth century.
Although some historians speak of a nascent world
economy, we should remember that local, regional, and
intra-European trade still predominated. About one-tenth
of English and Dutch exports were shipped across the
Atlantic; slightly more went to the East. What made the
transoceanic trade rewarding, however, was not the volume but the value of its goods. Dutch, English, and
French merchants were bringing back products that were
still consumed largely by the wealthy but were beginning
to make their way into the lives of artisans and merchants.
Pepper and spices from the Indies, West Indian and
Brazilian sugar, and Asian coffee and tea were becoming
more readily available to European consumers.
Trade within Europe remained strong throughout the
eighteenth century, although this trade increased only slightly
while overseas trade boomed. From 1716 to 1789, total
French exports quadrupled; intra-European trade, which
constituted 75 percent of these exports in 1716, accounted
for only 50 percent of the total in 1789. This increase in
overseas trade has led some historians to proclaim the
emergence of a truly global economy in the eighteenth
century. Trade patterns now interlocked Europe, Africa,
the East, and the Americas.

CONCLUSION
At the end of the fifteenth century, Europeans sailed out into the world
in all directions. Beginning with the handful of Portuguese ships that
ventured southward along the West African coast in the mid-fifteenth
century, the process accelerated with the epochal voyages of Christopher
Columbus to the Americas and Vasco da Gama to the Indian Ocean in
the 1490s. Soon a number of other European states had joined in the
adventure, and by the end of the eighteenth century, they had created a
global trade network dominated by Western ships and Western power.
In less than three hundred years, the European Age of
Exploration changed the shape of the world. In some areas, such as
the Americas and the Spice Islands, it led to the destruction of
indigenous civilizations and the establishment of European
colonies. In others, as in Africa, India, and mainland Southeast Asia,
it left native regimes intact but had a strong impact on local
societies and regional trade patterns.
At the time, many European observers viewed the process in a
favorable light. It not only expanded wealth through world trade and
exchanged crops and discoveries between the Old World and the New,
they believed, but it also introduced ‘‘heathen peoples’’ to the message
of Jesus Christ. The conquest of the Americas and expansion into the
rest of the world brought out most of the worst and some of the best

force to be exported to all corners of the earth.
