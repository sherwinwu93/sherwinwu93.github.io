CRITICAL THINKING

Q In what ways did Renaissance art and the humanist
movement reflect the political, economic, and social
developments of the period?

Michelangelo’s Creation of Adam on the Sistine Chapel ceiling

WERE THE FOURTEENTH and fifteenth centuries a continuation of the Middle Ages or the beginning of a new era? The answer
is that both positions are true. Although the disintegrative patterns
of the fourteenth century continued into the fifteenth, at the same
time there were elements of recovery that made the fifteenth century
a period of significant political, economic, artistic, and intellectual
change. The humanists or intellectuals of the age considered their
period (from the mid-fourteenth to the mid-sixteenth century) an
age of rebirth, believing that they had restored arts and letters to
new glory after they had been ‘‘neglected’’ or ‘‘dead’’ for centuries.
The humanists also saw their age as one of accomplished individuals
who dominated the landscape of their time. Michelangelo, the great
Italian artist of the early sixteenth century, and Pope Julius II, the
‘‘warrior pope,’’ were two such titans. The artist’s temperament and
the pope’s temper led to many lengthy and often loud quarrels between the two. Among other commissions, the pope had hired
Michelangelo to paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome, a
daunting task for a man long accustomed to being a sculptor.
Michelangelo undertook the project but refused for a long time to
allow anyone, including the pope, to see his work. Julius grew anxious, pestering Michelangelo on a regular basis about when the
ceiling would be finished. Exasperated by the pope’s requests,
Michelangelo once replied, according to Giorgio Vasari, his contemporary biographer, that the ceiling would be completed ‘‘when it satisfies me as an artist.’’ The pope responded, ‘‘And we want you to
satisfy us and finish it soon,’’ and then threatened that if Michelangelo did not ‘‘finish the ceiling quickly [the pope] would have him
thrown down from the scaffolding.’’ Fearing the pope’s anger,
Michelangelo ‘‘lost no time in doing all that was wanted’’ and
quickly completed the ceiling, one of the great masterpieces of
Western art.

The humanists’ view of their age as a rebirth of the Classical
civilization of the Greeks and Romans ultimately led historians to
use the French word Renaissance to identify this age. Although recent
historians have emphasized the many elements of continuity between
the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, the latter age was also distinguished by its own unique characteristics.

Characteristics of the Italian
Renaissance

Q Focus Question: What characteristics distinguish the
Renaissance from the Middle Ages?

Renaissance means ‘‘rebirth.’’ Many people who lived in
Italy between 1350 and 1550 believed that they were witnessing a rebirth of antiquity or Greco-Roman civilization,
marking a new age. To them, the thousand or so years
between the end of the Roman Empire and their own era
was a middle period (the ‘‘Middle Ages’’), characterized by
darkness because of its lack of Classical culture. Historians
of the nineteenth century later used similar terminology to
describe this period in Italy. The Swiss historian and art
critic Jacob Burckhardt created the modern concept of the
Renaissance in his celebrated work Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy, published in 1860. He portrayed Italy in
the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries as the birthplace of
the modern world and saw the revival of antiquity, the
‘‘perfecting of the individual,’’ and secularism (‘‘worldliness
of the Italians’’) as its distinguishing features. Burckhardt
established the framework for all modern interpretations
of the period. Although contemporary scholars do not
believe that the Renaissance represents a sudden or dramatic cultural break with the Middle Ages (as Burckhardt
argued)---there was, after all, much continuity between the
two periods in economic, political, and social life---the
Renaissance can still be viewed as a distinct period of
European history that manifested itself first in Italy and
then spread to the rest of Europe. What, then, are the
characteristics of the Italian Renaissance?

Renaissance Italy was largely an urban society. The
city-states, especially those of northern Italy, became the
centers of Italian political, economic, and social life. In
this new urban society, a secular spirit emerged as increasing wealth created new possibilities for the enjoyment of worldly things (see the box on p. 244).

Above all, the Renaissance was an age of recovery
from the ‘‘calamitous fourteenth century.’’ Italy and the
rest of Europe began a slow process of recuperation from
the effects of the Black Death, political disorder, and
economic recession. Recovery was accompanied by a rediscovery of the culture of Classical antiquity. Increasingly
aware of their own historical past, Italian intellectuals
became intensely interested in the Greco-Roman culture
of the ancient Mediterranean world. This revival of
Classical antiquity (the Middle Ages had in fact preserved
much of ancient Latin culture) affected politics and art
and led to new attempts to reconcile the pagan philosophy of antiquity with Christian thought, as well as new
ways of viewing human beings.

A revived emphasis on individual ability became
characteristic of the Italian Renaissance. As the fifteenthcentury Florentine architect Leon Battista Alberti expressed it, ‘‘Men can do all things if they will.’’1 A high
regard for human dignity and worth and a realization of
individual potentiality created a new social ideal of the
well-rounded personality or universal person (l’uomo
universale) who was capable of achievements in many areas
of life.

These general features of the Italian Renaissance were
not characteristic of all Italians but were primarily the
preserve of the wealthy upper classes, who constituted a
small percentage of the total population. The achievements
of the Italian Renaissance were thus the product of an elite,
rather than a mass, movement. Nevertheless, indirectly it
did have some impact on ordinary people, especially in the
cities, where so many of the intellectual and artistic accomplishments of the period were most apparent.

The Making of
Renaissance Society

Q Focus Question: What major social changes occurred
in the Renaissance?

After the severe economic reversals and social upheavals
of the second half of the fourteenth century, the European
economy gradually recovered during the fifteenth century
as manufacturing and trade increased in volume.

Economic Recovery

By the fourteenth century, Italian merchants were carrying
on a flourishing commerce throughout the Mediterranean
and had also expanded their lines of trade north along the
Atlantic seaboard. The great galleys of the Venetian Flanders Fleet maintained a direct sea route from Venice to
England and the Netherlands, where Italian merchants
came into contact with the increasingly powerful Hanseatic League of merchants. Hard hit by the plague, the
Italians lost their commercial preeminence while the
Hanseatic League continued to prosper.

Expansion of Trade

As early as the thirteenth century, a
number of north German coastal towns had formed a
commercial and military alliance known as the Hansa or
the Hanseatic League. By 1500, more than eighty cities
belonged to the League, which established settlements
and commercial bases in northern Europe and England.
For almost two hundred years, the Hansa had a monopoly on northern European trade in timber, fish, grain,
metals, honey, and wines. Its southern outlet in Flanders,
the city of Bruges, became the economic crossroads of
Europe in the fourteenth century because it served as the
meeting place between Hanseatic merchants and the
Flanders Fleet of Venice. In the fifteenth century, however,
the Hanseatic League proved increasingly unable to
compete with the developing larger territorial states.

Overall, trade recovered dramatically from the economic contraction of the fourteenth century. The Italians and especially the Venetians continued to maintain
a wealthy commercial empire. Not until the sixteenth
century, when overseas discoveries gave new importance
to the states facing the Atlantic, did the petty Italian citystates begin to suffer from the competitive advantages of
the ever-growing and more powerful national territorial
states.

Industries Old and New

The economic depression of the
fourteenth century also affected patterns of manufacturing. The woolen industries of Flanders and the northern
Italian cities had been particularly devastated. By the
beginning of the fifteenth century, however, the Florentine woolen industry began to recover. At the same time,
the Italian cities began to develop and expand luxury
industries, including lace and silk, glassware, and handworked items in metal and precious stones.

Other new industries, especially printing, mining,
and metallurgy, began to rival the textile industry in
importance in the fifteenth century. New machinery and
techniques for digging deeper mines and for separating
metals from ore and purifying them were developed, and
entrepreneurs quickly developed large mining operations to produce copper, iron, and silver. Especially
valuable were the rich mineral deposits in central Europe. Expanding iron production and new skills in
metalworking in turn contributed to the development of
firearms that were more effective than the crude weapons
of the fourteenth century.

Banking and the Medici

The city of Florence regained
its preeminence in banking in the fifteenth century, due
primarily to the Medici family. In its best days (in the
fifteenth century), the house of Medici was the greatest
banking establishment in Europe, with branches in Venice, Milan, Rome, Avignon, Bruges, London, and Lyons.
Moreover, the family had controlling interests in industrial enterprises for wool, silk, and the mining of alum,
which was used to dye textiles. Despite its great success,
the Medici bank suffered a sudden decline at the end of
the fifteenth century due to poor leadership and a series
of bad loans, especially to rulers. In 1494, when the
French expelled the Medici from Florence and confiscated
their property, the entire financial edifice collapsed.

Social Changes in the Renaissance

The Renaissance inherited its social structure from the
Middle Ages. Society remained fundamentally divided into
three estates: the First Estate, the clergy, whose preeminence
was grounded in the belief that people should be guided to
spiritual ends; the Second Estate, the nobility, whose privileges were based on the principle that the nobles provided
security and justice for society; and the Third Estate, the
peasants and inhabitants of the towns and cities. This social
order experienced certain adaptations in the Renaissance,
which we can see by examining the Second and Third
Estates (the clergy will be examined in Chapter 13).

The Nobility

Throughout much of Europe, the landholding nobles faced declining real incomes during the
greater part of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. But
many members of the old nobility survived, and new
blood infused its ranks. A reconstruction of the aristocracy
was well under way by 1500. As a result of this reconstruction, the nobles, old and new, who constituted between 2 and 3 percent of the population in most countries,
managed to dominate society as they had done in the
Middle Ages, serving as military officers and holding
important political posts as well as advising the king.

By 1500, the noble or aristocrat was expected to
evince certain ideals. These ideals were best expressed in
The Book of the Courtier by the Italian Baldassare Castiglione (1478--1529). Published in 1528, Castiglione’s
work soon became popular throughout Europe, and it
remained a basic handbook for European aristocrats well
into the twentieth century.

In his book, Castiglione described the three basic attributes of the perfect courtier. First, nobles should possess
fundamental native endowments, such as impeccable character, grace, talents, and noble birth. The perfect courtier
must also cultivate certain achievements. Primarily, he
should participate in military and bodily exercises because
the principal profession of a courtier was arms. But unlike
the medieval knight, the Renaissance courtier was also expected to have a Classical education and adorn his life with
the arts by playing a musical instrument, drawing, and
painting. In Castiglione’s hands, the Renaissance ideal of the
well-developed personality became a social ideal of the aristocracy. Finally, the aristocrat was expected to follow a
certain standard of conduct. Nobles were to make a good
impression; while being modest, they should not hide their
accomplishments but show them with grace.

What was the purpose of these courtly standards?
Castiglione said:

I think that the aim of the perfect Courtier . . . is so to win
for himself, by means of the accomplishments ascribed to
him by these gentlemen, the favor and mind of the prince
whom he serves that he may be able to tell him, and
always will tell him, the truth about everything he needs to
know, without fear or risk of displeasing him; and that
when he sees the mind of his prince inclined to a wrong
action, he may dare to oppose him . . . so as to dissuade
him of every evil intent and bring him to the path of
virtue.

The aim of the perfect noble, then, was to serve his
prince in an effective and honest way. Nobles would
adhere to these principles for hundreds of years while
they continued to dominate European life socially and
politically.

Peasants and Townspeople

Peasants made up the
overwhelming mass of the Third Estate, and except in the
highly urbanized areas of northern Italy and Flanders,
they continued to constitute as much as 85 to 90 percent
of the total European population. The most noticeable
trend produced by the economic crisis of the fourteenth
century was the decline of the manorial system and the
continuing elimination of serfdom. The contraction of
the peasantry after the Black Death simply accelerated the
process of converting servile labor dues into rents paid in
money. By the end of the fifteenth century, primarily in
western Europe, serfdom was declining, and more and
more peasants were becoming legally free.

The remainder of the Third Estate centered around
the inhabitants of towns and cities, originally the merchants and artisans who formed the bourgeoisie. The
Renaissance town or city of the fifteenth century actually
possessed a multitude of townspeople widely separated
socially and economically.

At the top of urban society were the patricians, whose
wealth from capitalistic enterprises in trade, industry, and
banking enabled them to dominate their urban communities economically, socially, and politically. Below them
were the petty burghers, the shopkeepers, artisans, guildmasters, and guildsmen who were largely concerned with
providing goods and services for local consumption. Below these two groups were the propertyless workers
earning pitiful wages and the unemployed, living squalid
and miserable lives; these people constituted as much as
30 to 40 percent of the urban population. Everywhere in
Europe in the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, urban poverty had increased dramatically. One rich merchant of Florence wrote:

Those that are lazy and indolent in a way that does harm to
the city, and who can offer no just reason for their condition,
should either be forced to work or expelled from the Commune. The city would thus rid itself of that most harmful
part of the poorest class. . . . If the lowest order of society
earn enough food to keep them going from day to day, then
they have enough.3

But even this large group was not at the bottom of the
social scale; beneath it stood a significantly large group of
slaves, especially in the cities of Italy.

Family and Marriage in Renaissance Italy

The family bond was a source of great security in the
urban world of Renaissance Italy. To maintain the family,
careful attention was given to marriages that were arranged by parents, often to strengthen business or family
ties. Details were worked out well in advance, sometimes
when children were only five or six years old, and reinforced by a legally binding marriage contract (see the
box on p. 247). The important aspect of the contract was
the size of the dowry, a sum of money presented by the
wife’s family upon marriage. The dowry could involve
large sums of money and was expected of all families.

The father-husband was the center of the Italian family.
He gave it his name, was responsible for it in all legal
matters, managed all finances (his wife had no share in his
wealth), and made the crucial decisions in his children’s
lives. A father’s authority over his children was absolute
until he died or formally freed his children. The age of
emancipation varied from early teens to late twenties.

The wife managed the household, a position that
gave women a certain degree of autonomy in their daily
lives. Most wives, however, also knew that their primary
function was to bear children. Upper-class wives were
frequently pregnant; Alessandra Strozzi of Florence, for
example, who had been married at the age of sixteen, bore
eight children in ten years.

For women in the Renaissance, childbirth was a
fearful occasion. Not only was it painful, but it could be
deadly; possibly as many as 10 percent of mothers died in
childbirth. In his memoirs, the Florentine merchant
Gregorio Dati recalled that three of his four wives died in
childbirth. His third wife, after delivering eleven children
in fifteen years, ‘‘died in childbirth after lengthy suffering,
which she bore with remarkable strength and patience.’’4
Nor did the tragedies end with childbirth. Surviving
mothers often faced the death of their children. In Florence in the fifteenth century, for example, almost half of
the children born to merchant families died before the age
of twenty. Given these mortality rates, many upper-class
families sought to have as many children as possible in
order to ensure a surviving male heir to the family fortune. This concern is evident in the Florentine humanist
Leon Battista Alberti’s treatise On the Family, when one of
the characters remarks, ‘‘How many families do we see
today in decadence and ruin! . . . Of all these families not
only the magnificence and greatness but the very men, not
only the men but the very names are shrunk away and
gone. Their memory . . . is wiped out and obliterated.’’

The Italian States
in the Renaissance

Q Focus Question: How did Machiavelli’s works reflect
the political realities of Renaissance Italy?

By the fifteenth century, five major powers dominated the
Italian peninsula: the duchy of Milan, Venice, Florence, the
Papal States, and the kingdom of Naples (see Map 12.1).
Northern Italy was divided between Milan and Venice.
After the death of the last Visconti ruler of Milan in 1447,
Francesco Sforza, one of the leading condottieri (a condottiere was the leader of a mercenary band) of the time,
turned on his Milanese employers, conquered the city, and
became its new duke. Both the Visconti and Sforza rulers
worked to create a highly centralized territorial state. They
were especially successful in devising systems of taxation
that generated enormous revenues for the government.
The maritime republic of Venice remained an extremely
stable political entity governed by a small oligarchy of
merchant-aristocrats. Its commercial empire brought in
enormous revenues and gave it the status of an international power.

The republic of Florence dominated the region of
Tuscany. In 1434, Cosimo de’ Medici (1434--1464) took
control of the ruling oligarchy. Although the wealthy
Medici family maintained republican forms of government for appearance’s sake, it ran the government from
behind the scenes. Through lavish patronage and careful
courting of political allies, Cosimo and later his grandson
Lorenzo the Magnificent (1469--1492) were successful in
dominating the city at a time when Florence was the
center of the cultural Renaissance.

The Papal States lay in central Italy. Nominally under
the control of the popes, papal residence in Avignon and the
Great Schism had enabled individual cities
and territories, such as Urbino and Ferrara, to become independent of papal
authority. The popes of the fifteenth century directed much of their energy toward
reestablishing their control over the Papal
States. The kingdom of Naples, which
encompassed most of southern Italy and
usually the island of Sicily, remained a
backward monarchy that shared little in
the cultural glories of the Renaissance.

A number of independent city-states
under the control of powerful ruling
families also became brilliant centers of
Renaissance culture in the fifteenth century. Perhaps most famous was Urbino,
ruled by the Montefeltro dynasty. Federigo da Montefeltro, who ruled Urbino
from 1444 to 1482, received a Classical
education. He had also learned the skills of
fighting, since the Montefeltro family
compensated for the poverty of Urbino by
hiring themselves out as condottieri. Federigo was not only a good ruler but also a
rather unusual condottiere by fifteenthcentury standards. Although not a brilliant general, he was reliable and honest.
At the same time, Duke Federigo was one
of the greatest patrons of Renaissance
culture. Under his direction, Urbino became a well-known cultural and intellectual center.

A noticeable feature of these smaller
Italian courts was the important role
played by women. The most famous of
the Italian ruling women was Isabella d’Este (1474--1539),
daughter of the duke of Ferrara, who married Francesco
Gonzaga, marquis of Mantua. Their court was another
important center of art and learning in the Renaissance.
Educated at the brilliant court of Ferrara, Isabella was
known for her intelligence and political wisdom. Called
the ‘‘first lady of the world,’’ she attracted artists and intellectuals to the Mantuan court and was responsible for
amassing one of the finest libraries in all of Italy. Her
numerous letters to friends, family, princes, and artists all
over Europe disclose her political acumen as well as a
good sense of humor. Both before and after the death of
her husband Francesco, she effectively ruled Mantua.

The growth of powerful monarchical states led to
trouble for the Italians and brought an end to the independence of the Italian states. Attracted by the riches of
Italy, the French king Charles VIII (1483--1498) led an
army of thirty thousand men into Italy in 1494 and occupied the kingdom of Naples. Other Italian states turned
for help to the Spanish, who gladly complied. For the next
thirty years, the French and Spanish competed to dominate Italy, which was merely a pawn for the two great
powers, a convenient arena for fighting battles. The terrible sack of Rome in 1527 by the armies of the Spanish
king Charles I brought a temporary end to the Italian
wars. From then on, the Spaniards dominated Italy; the
Renaissance in Italy was over.

Machiavelli and the New Statecraft

No one gave better expression to the Renaissance preoccupation with political power than Niccolo` Machiavelli
(1469--1527). Although he ably served as a diplomat for
Florence, he was eventually forced into exile. Embittered by
this and compelled by the great love of his life---politics---he
wrote The Prince, one of the most influential works on
political power in the Western world.

Machiavelli’s major concerns in The Prince were the
acquisition, maintenance, and expansion of political power
as the means to restore and maintain order in his time. In
the Middle Ages, many political theorists stressed the
ethical side of a prince’s activity---how a ruler ought to
behave based on Christian moral principles. Machiavelli
bluntly contradicted this approach:

My hope is to write a book that will be useful, at least to
those who read it intelligently, and so I thought it sensible to
go straight to a discussion of how things are in real life and
not waste time with a discussion of an imaginary world . . . for
the gap between how people actually behave and how they
ought to behave is so great that anyone who ignores everyday
reality in order to live up to an ideal will soon discover he
had been taught how to destroy himself, not how to preserve
himself.

Machiavelli considered his approach far more realistic
than that of his medieval forebears.

From Machiavelli’s point of view, a prince’s attitude
toward power must be based on an understanding of human nature, which he perceived as basically self-centered.
He said, ‘‘Of men one can, in general, say this: They are
ungrateful, fickle, deceptive and deceiving, avoiders of
danger, eager to gain.’’ Political activity, therefore, could
not be restricted by moral considerations. The prince acts
on behalf of the state and for the sake of the state must be
willing to let his conscience sleep. As Machiavelli put it:

You need to understand this: A ruler, and particularly a ruler
who is new to power, cannot conform to all those rules that
men who are thought good are expected to respect, for he is
often obliged, in order to hold on to power, to break his
word, to be uncharitable, inhumane, and irreligious. So he
must be mentally prepared to act as circumstances and
changes in fortune require. As I have said, he should do
what is right if he can; but he must be prepared to do wrong
if necessary.

Machiavelli found a good example of the new Italian
ruler in Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander VI
(popes were supposed to be celibate), who used ruthless
measures to achieve his goal of carving out a new state in
central Italy. As Machiavelli said, ‘‘Anyone who decides
that the policy to follow when one has newly acquired
power is to destroy one’s enemies, to secure some allies, to
win wars, whether by force or by fraud, to make oneself
both loved and feared by one’s subjects, . . . cannot hope
to find, in the recent past, a better model to imitate than
Cesare Borgia.’’8 Machiavelli was among the first to
abandon morality as the basis for the analysis of political
activity (see the box on p. 251).

The Intellectual
Renaissance in Italy

Q Focus Question: What was humanism, and what effect
did it have on philosophy, education, and attitudes
toward politics?

Individualism and secularism---two characteristics of the
Italian Renaissance---were most noticeable in the intellectual and artistic realms. Italian culture had matured by
the fourteenth century. For the next two centuries, Italy
was the cultural leader of Europe. This new Italian culture
was primarily the product of a relatively wealthy, urban
lay society. The most important literary movement associated with the Renaissance is humanism.

Italian Renaissance Humanism

Renaissance humanism was an intellectual movement
based on the study of the Classical literary works of Greece
and Rome. Humanists studied the liberal arts---grammar,
rhetoric, poetry, moral philosophy or ethics, and history---
all based on the writings of ancient Greek and Roman
authors. These are the subjects we call the humanities.
Petrarch (1304--1374), often called the father of
Italian Renaissance humanism, did more than any other
individual in the fourteenth century to foster development of the movement. Petrarch sought to find forgotten
Latin manuscripts and set in motion a search of monastic
libraries throughout Europe. In his preoccupation with
the classics and their secular content, Petrarch doubted at
times whether he was sufficiently attentive to spiritual
ideals. His qualms, however, did not prevent him from
inaugurating the humanist emphasis on the use of pure
Classical Latin, making it fashionable for humanists to
use Cicero as a model for prose and Virgil for poetry.
Petrarch said, ‘‘Christ is my God; Cicero is the prince of
the language.’’

In Florence, the humanist movement took a new
direction at the beginning of the fifteenth century when it
became closely tied to Florentine civic spirit and pride,
giving rise to what has been labeled civic humanism.
Fourteenth-century humanists such as Petrarch had described the intellectual life as one of solitude. They rejected family and a life of action in the community. In the
busy civic world of Florence, however, intellectuals began
to take a new view of their role as intellectuals. The
Classical Roman statesman and intellectual Cicero became their model. Leonardo Bruni (1370--1444), a humanist, Florentine patriot, and chancellor of the city,
wrote a biography of Cicero titled the New Cicero, in
which he waxed enthusiastic about the fusion of political
action and literary creation in Cicero’s life. From Bruni’s
time on, Cicero served as the inspiration for the Renaissance ideal that it was the duty of an intellectual to live an
active life for one’s state. An individual only ‘‘grows to
maturity---both intellectually and morally---through participation’’ in the life of the state. Civic humanism reflected the values of the urban society of the Italian
Renaissance. Humanists came to believe that their study
of the humanities should be put to the service of the state.
It is no accident that humanists served the state as
chancellors, councillors, and advisers.

Also evident in the humanism of the first half of the
fifteenth century was a growing interest in Classical
Greek civilization. Bruni was one of the first Italian
humanists to gain a thorough knowledge of Greek. He
became an enthusiastic pupil of the Byzantine scholar
Manuel Chrysoloras, who taught in Florence from 1396
to 1400. Humanists eagerly perused the works of Plato as
well as Greek poets, dramatists, historians, and orators,
such as Thucydides, Euripides, and Sophocles, all of
whom had been neglected by the scholastics of the High
Middle Ages.

Humanism and Philosophy

In the second half of the
fifteenth century, a dramatic upsurge of interest in the
works of Plato occurred. Cosimo de’ Medici, the de
facto ruler of Florence, encouraged this development by
commissioning a translation of Plato’s dialogues by
Marsilio Ficino (1433--1499), who dedicated his life to
the translation of Plato and the exposition of the Platonic philosophy known as Neoplatonism.

In two major works, Ficino undertook the synthesis of Christianity and Platonism into a single system. His Neoplatonism was based on two primary
ideas, the Neoplatonic hierarchy of substances and a
theory of spiritual love. The former postulated a hierarchy of substances, or great chain of being, from the
lowest form of physical matter (plants) to the purest
spirit (God), in which humans occupied a central or
middle position. They were the link between the material world (through the body) and the spiritual world
(through the soul), and their highest duty was to ascend toward that union with God that was the true end
of human existence. Ficino’s theory of spiritual or
Platonic love maintained that just as all people are
bound together in their common humanity by love, so
are all parts of the universe held together by bonds of
sympathetic love.

Renaissance Hermeticism

Hermeticism was another
product of the Florentine intellectual environment of the
late fifteenth century. At the request of Cosimo de’
Medici, Ficino translated into Latin a Greek work titled
Corpus Hermeticum. The Hermetic manuscripts offered
Renaissance intellectuals a new view of humankind. They
believed that humans had been created as divine beings
endowed with divine creative power but had freely chosen
to enter the material world (nature). Humans could recover their divinity, however, through a regenerative experience or purification of the soul. Thus regenerated,
they became true sages or magi, as the Renaissance called
them, who had knowledge of God and of truth. In regaining their original divinity, they reacquired an intimate knowledge of nature and the ability to employ the
powers of nature for beneficial purposes.

In Italy, the most prominent magi in the late fifteenth
century were Ficino and his friend and pupil Giovanni
Pico della Mirandola (1463--1494). Pico produced one of
the most famous treatises of the Renaissance, Oration on
the Dignity of Man. Pico combed diligently through the
writings of many philosophers of different backgrounds
for the common ‘‘nuggets of universal truth’’ that he
believed were all part of God’s revelation to humanity. In
the Oration, Pico offered a ringing statement of unlimited
human potential: ‘‘To him it is granted to have whatever
he chooses, to be whatever he wills.’’9 Like Ficino, Pico
took an avid interest in Hermetic philosophy, accepting it
as the ‘‘science of the Divine,’’ which ‘‘embraces the
deepest contemplation of the most secret things, and at
last the knowledge of all nature.’’10

Education in the Renaissance

The humanist movement had a profound effect on education. Renaissance humanists believed that human beings could be dramatically changed by education, and as a
result, they wrote treatises on education and opened
schools based on their ideas. At the core of humanist
schools were the ‘‘liberal studies.’’ Humanists believed that
the ‘‘liberal studies’’ (what we call the liberal arts) were the
key to true freedom, enabling individuals to reach their
full potential. The liberal studies included history, moral
philosophy, eloquence (rhetoric), letters (grammar and
logic), poetry, mathematics, astronomy, and music. The
purpose of a liberal education was thus to produce individuals who followed a path of virtue and wisdom and
possessed the rhetorical skills by which they could persuade others to do the same. Following the Greek precept
of a sound mind in a sound body, humanist educators
also stressed physical education. Pupils were taught the
skills of javelin throwing, archery, and dancing and encouraged to run, wrestle, hunt, and swim.

The purpose of these humanist schools was to educate an elite, the ruling classes of their communities.
Largely absent from such schools were females. The few
female students who did attend humanist schools studied
the classics and were encouraged to know some history
and to ride, dance, sing, play the lute, and appreciate
poetry. But they were told not to learn mathematics and
rhetoric. Religion and morals were thought to hold first
place in the education of Christian ladies and help prepare them for their roles as mothers and wives.

Nevertheless, some women in Italy who were educated in the humanist fashion went on to establish their
own literary careers. Isotta Nogarola, born to a noble
family in Verona, mastered Latin and wrote numerous
letters and treatises that brought her praise from male
Italian intellectuals. Laura Cereta was educated in Latin
by her father, a physician from Brescia. Laura defended
the ability of women to pursue scholarly pursuits (see the
box on p. 253).

Humanist education was thought to be a practical
preparation for life. Its aim was the creation not of a great
scholar but of a complete citizen. As one humanist said,
‘‘Not everyone is obliged to excel in philosophy, medicine,
or the law, nor are all equally favored by nature; but all are
destined to live in society and to practice virtue.’’11 Humanist schools provided the model for the basic education
of the European ruling classes until the twentieth century.

The Impact of Printing

The Renaissance period witnessed the development of
printing, one of the most important technological
innovations of Western civilization. The art of printing
had an immediate impact on European intellectual life
and thought. Printing from hand-carved wooden blocks
had been done in the West since the twelfth century and
in China even before that. What was new to Europe in the
fifteenth century was repeatable printing with movable
metal type. The development of printing from movable
type was a gradual process that culminated between 1445
and 1450; Johannes Gutenberg of Mainz played an important role in bringing the process to completion.
Gutenberg’s Bible, completed in 1455 or 1456, was the
first true book in the West produced with movable type.

The new printing capability spread rapidly throughout Europe in the second half of the fifteenth century. By
1500, there were more than a thousand printers in Europe
who had published almost forty thousand titles (between
eight and ten million copies). Probably 50 percent of these
books were religious---Bibles, books of devotion, and sermons. Next in importance were the Latin and Greek
classics, medieval grammars, legal handbooks, works on
philosophy, and an ever-growing number of popular
romances.

Printing became one of the largest industries in
Europe, and its effects were soon felt in many areas of
European life. The printing of books encouraged the
development of scholarly research and the desire to attain knowledge. Moreover, printing facilitated cooperation among scholars and helped produce standardized
and definitive texts. Printing also stimulated the development of an ever-expanding lay reading public, a development that had an enormous impact on European
society. Indeed, the new religious ideas of the Reformation would never have spread as rapidly as they did in the
sixteenth century without the printing press.

The Artistic Renaissance

Q Focus Question: What were the chief characteristics of
Renaissance art, and how did it differ in Italy and
northern Europe?

Leonardo da Vinci, one of the great Italian Renaissance
artists, once explained, ‘‘The painter will produce pictures
of small merit if he takes for his standard the pictures of
others, but if he will study from natural objects he will
bear good fruit. . . . Those who take for their standard any
one but nature . . . weary themselves in vain.’’12 Renaissance artists considered the imitation of nature their
primary goal. Their search for naturalism became an end
in itself: to persuade onlookers of the reality of the object
or event they were portraying. At the same time, the new
artistic standards reflected a new attitude of mind as well,
one in which human beings became the focus of attention, the ‘‘center and measure of all things, as one artist
proclaimed.

Early Renaissance Art

The frescoes by Masaccio (1401--1428) in the Brancacci
Chapel in Florence have long been regarded as the first
masterpieces of Early Renaissance art. In his use of
monumental figures, the demonstration of a more realistic
relationship between figures and landscape, and the visual
representation of the laws of perspective, a new realistic
style of painting was born. Onlookers became aware of a
world of reality that appeared to be a continuation of their
own world.

This new or Renaissance style was absorbed and
modified by other Florentine painters in the fifteenth
century. Especially important was the development of an
experimental trend that took two directions. One emphasized the mathematical side of painting, the working
out of the laws of perspective and the organization of
outdoor space and light by geometry and perspective.
The other aspect of the experimental trend involved the
investigation of movement and anatomical structure.
Indeed, the realistic portrayal of the human nude became
one of the foremost preoccupations of Italian Renaissance
art. The fifteenth century, then, was a period of experimentation and technical mastery.

The revolutionary achievements of Florentine painters
in the fifteenth century were matched by equally stunning
advances in sculpture and architecture. Donato di Donatello (1386--1466) spent time in Rome, studying and
copying the statues of antiquity. His subsequent work in
Florence reveals how well he had mastered the essence of
what he saw. Among his numerous works was a statue of
David that was the first known life-size freestanding bronze
nude in European art since antiquity. Like Donatello’s
other statues, David radiated a simplicity and strength that
reflected the dignity of humanity.

Filippo Brunelleschi (1377--1446) was a friend of Donatello’s who accompanied him to Rome. Brunelleschi drew
much inspiration from the architectural monuments of
Roman antiquity, and when he returned to Florence, the
Medici commissioned him to design the church of San
Lorenzo. Inspired by Roman models, Brunelleschi created a
church interior very different from that of the great medieval cathedrals. San Lorenzo’s Classical columns, rounded
arches, and coffered ceiling created an environment that
did not overwhelm the worshiper, materially or psychologically, as Gothic cathedrals did; instead, it comforted
in that it was a space created to fit human, not divine,
measurements.

The Artistic High Renaissance

By the end of the fifteenth century, Italian painters,
sculptors, and architects had created a new artistic
environment. Many artists had mastered the new techniques for a scientific observation of the world around
them and were now ready to move into individualistic
forms of creative expression. This final stage of Renaissance art, which flourished between 1480 and 1520, is
called the High Renaissance. The High Renaissance was
marked by the increasing importance of Rome as a
cultural center.

The High Renaissance was dominated by the work
of three artistic giants: Leonardo da Vinci (1452--1519),
Raphael (1483--1520), and Michelangelo (1475--1564).
Leonardo represents a transitional figure in the shift to
High Renaissance principles. He stressed the need to
advance beyond such realism and initiated the High
Renaissance’s preoccupation with the idealization of
nature, or the attempt to generalize from realistic portrayal to an ideal form. Leonardo’s Last Supper, painted
in Milan, is a brilliant summary of fifteenth-century
trends in its organization of space and use of perspective
to depict subjects three dimensionally. But it is also
more. The figure of Philip is idealized, and there are
profound psychological dimensions to the work. Jesus’
words---‘‘One of you shall betray me’’---are experienced
directly as each of the apostles reveals his personality
and his relationship to the Savior. Through gestures
and movement, Leonardo hoped to reveal a person’s
inner life.

Raphael blossomed as a painter at an early age; at
twenty-five, he was already regarded as one of Italy’s best.
Raphael was acclaimed for his numerous madonnas
(portraits of the Virgin Mary), in which he attempted to
achieve an ideal of beauty far surpassing human standards. He is well known for his frescoes in the Vatican
Palace; his School of Athens reveals a world of balance,
harmony, and order---the underlying principles of the art
of Classical Greece and Rome.

Michelangelo, an accomplished painter, sculptor, and
architect, was another giant of the High Renaissance.
Fiercely driven by his desire to create, he worked with
great passion and energy on a remarkable number of
projects. Michelangelo was influenced by Neoplatonism,
especially evident in his figures on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome. In 1508, Pope Julius II had called
Michelangelo to Rome and commissioned him to decorate the chapel ceiling. This colossal project was not
completed until 1512. Michelangelo attempted to tell the
story of the Fall of Man by depicting nine scenes from the
biblical book of Genesis. In his Creation of Adam (reproduced at the start of this chapter), the well-proportioned
figure of Adam awaits the divine spark. Adam, like the
other muscular figures on the ceiling, reveals an ideal type
of human being with perfect proportions. In good Neoplatonic fashion, the beauty of these figures is meant to be
a reflection of divine beauty; the more beautiful the body,
the more God-like the figure.

Another manifestation of Michelangelo’s search for
ideal beauty was his David (on p. 258), a colossal marble
statue commissioned by the Florentine government in
1501 and completed in 1504. Michelangelo maintained
that the form of a statue already resided in the uncarved
piece of stone: ‘‘I only take away the surplus; the statue
is already there.’’13 Out of a piece of marble that had
remained unused for fifty years, Michelangelo created a
14-foot-high figure, the largest sculpture in Italy since
Roman times. An awe-inspiring hero, Michelangelo’s
David proudly proclaims the beauty of the human body
and the glory of human beings.

The Northern Artistic Renaissance

In trying to provide an exact portrayal of their world, the
artists of the north (especially the Low Countries) and
Italy took different approaches. In Italy, the human form
became the primary vehicle of expression as Italian artists
sought to master the technical skills that allowed them to
portray humans in realistic settings. The large wall spaces
of Italian churches had given rise to the art of fresco
painting, but in the north, the prevalence of Gothic cathedrals with their stained-glass windows resulted in
more emphasis on illuminated manuscripts and wooden
panel painting for altarpieces. The space available in these
works was limited, and great care was required to depict
each object, leading northern painters to become masters
at rendering details.

The most influential northern school of art in the
fifteenth century was centered in Flanders. Jan van Eyck
(c. 1380--1441) was among the first to use oil paint, a
medium that enabled the artist to use a varied range of
colors and make changes to create fine details. In the famous Giovanni Arnolfini and His Bride, van Eyck’s attention to detail is staggering in the precise portraits, a
glittering chandelier, and a mirror reflecting the objects in
the room. Although each detail was rendered as observed,
it is evident that van Eyck’s comprehension of perspective
was still uncertain. His work is truly indicative of northern
Renaissance painters, who, in their effort to imitate nature,
did so not by mastery of the laws of perspective and
proportion but by empirical observation of visual reality
and the accurate portrayal of details. Moreover, northern
painters placed great emphasis on the emotional intensity
of religious feeling and created great works of devotional
art, especially in their altarpieces. By the end of the fifteenth century, however, artists from the north began to
study in Italy and were visually influenced by what artists
were doing there.

One northern artist of this later period who was
greatly influenced by the Italians was Albrecht Du¨rer
(1471--1528) from Nuremberg. Du¨rer made two trips to
Italy and absorbed most of what the Italians could teach,
as is evident in his mastery of the laws of perspective and
Renaissance theories of proportion. He wrote detailed
treatises on both subjects. At the same time, as in his
famous Adoration of the Magi, Du¨rer did not reject the
use of minute details characteristic of northern artists.
He did try, however, to integrate those details more
harmoniously into his works and, like the Italian artists
of the High Renaissance, tried to achieve a standard of
ideal beauty by a careful examination of the human
form.

The European State
in the Renaissance

Q Focus Question: Why do historians sometimes refer to
the monarchies of the late fifteenth century as ‘‘new
monarchies’’ or ‘‘Renaissance states’’?

In the first half of the fifteenth century, European states
continued the disintegrative patterns of the previous
century. In the second half of the century, however,
recovery set in, and attempts were made to reestablish the
centralized power of monarchical governments. To characterize the results, some historians have used the label
‘‘Renaissance states’’; others have spoken of the ‘‘new
monarchies,’’ especially those of France, England, and
Spain at the end of the fifteenth century. Whereas monarchs succeeded to varying degrees at extending their
political authority in western Europe, rulers in central
and eastern Europe were often weak and unable to impose their will.

The Renaissance State in Western Europe

Although the Hundred Years’ War (1337--1453; see
Chapter 11) had made it difficult for French kings to
assert their authority, the war had also developed a strong
degree of French national feeling toward a common enemy that the kings could use to reestablish monarchical
power. The process of developing a French territorial state
was greatly advanced by King Louis XI (1461--1483),
known as the Spider because of his devious ways. Louis
strengthened the use of the taille---an annual direct tax,
usually on land or property---as a tax imposed by royal authority, giving him a regular and reliable source of income.
Louis repressed the French nobility and brought the provinces of Anjou, Maine, Bar, and Provence under royal
control.

England

The Hundred Years’ War also strongly affected
the other protagonist in that conflict, England. The cost
of the war in its final years and the losses in manpower
strained the English economy. Moreover, the end of the
war brought even greater domestic turmoil to England
when the War of the Roses broke out in the 1450s. This
civil war pitted the ducal house of Lancaster, whose
symbol was a red rose, against the ducal house of York,
whose symbol was a white rose. Many aristocratic families
of England were drawn into the conflict. Finally, in 1485,
Henry Tudor, duke of Richmond, defeated the last Yorkist
king, Richard III (1483--1485), at Bosworth Field and
established a new dynasty.

As the first Tudor king, Henry VII (1485--1509)
worked to reduce internal dissension and establish a
strong monarchical government. The new king was particularly successful in obtaining sufficient income from
the traditional financial resources of the English monarch,
such as the crown lands, judicial fees and fines, and
customs duties. By using diplomacy to avoid wars, which
are always expensive, the king avoided having to call
Parliament on any regular basis to grant him funds. By
not overburdening the landed gentry and middle class
with taxes, Henry won their favor, and they provided
much support for his monarchy. Henry’s policies gave
England a stable and prosperous government and enhanced the status of the monarchy.

Spain

Spain, too, experienced the growth of a strong
national monarchy by the end of the fifteenth century.
During the Middle Ages, several independent Christian
kingdoms had emerged in the course of the long reconquest of the Iberian peninsula from the Muslims (see
Map 12.2). Aragon and Castile were the strongest Spanish
kingdoms; in the west was the independent monarchy of
Portugal; in the north, the small kingdom of Navarre; and
in the south, the Muslim kingdom of Granada.

A major step toward the unification of Spain was
taken with the marriage of Isabella of Castile (1474--1504)
and Ferdinand of Aragon (1479--1516) in 1469. This was a
dynastic union of two rulers, not a political union. Both
kingdoms maintained their own parliaments (each known
as the Cortes), courts, laws, coinage, speech, customs,
and political organs. Nevertheless, the two rulers worked
to strengthen royal control of government, especially in
Castile. The royal council, which was supposed to supervise local administration and oversee the implementation of government policies, was stripped of aristocrats
and filled primarily with middle-class lawyers. Trained in
the principles of Roman law, these officials operated on
the belief that the monarchy embodied the power of the
state.

Ferdinand and Isabella reorganized the military
forces of Spain, seeking to replace the undisciplined
feudal levies they had inherited with a more professional
royal army. The development of a strong infantry force as
the heart of the new Spanish army made it the best in
Europe by the sixteenth century, and Spain emerged as an
important power in European affairs.
Ferdinand and Isabella also pursued a policy of strict
religious uniformity. Spain had two large religious minorities, Jews and Muslims, both of whom had been largely
tolerated in medieval Spain. Increased persecution in the
fourteenth century, however, led the majority of Spanish
Jews to convert to Christianity. But complaints about the
sincerity of these Jewish converts prompted Ferdinand and
Isabella to ask the pope to introduce the Inquisition into
Spain in 1478. Under royal control, the Inquisition worked
with cruel efficiency to guarantee the orthodoxy of the
converts but had no authority over practicing Jews. Consequently, in 1492, flush with the success of the conquest of
Muslim Granada, Ferdinand and Isabella took the drastic
step of expelling all professed Jews from Spain. It is estimated that 150,000 out of possibly 200,000 Jews fled.
Muslims, too, were then ‘‘encouraged’’ to convert to
Christianity, and in 1502, Isabella issued a decree expelling
all professed Muslims from her kingdom. To a very large
degree, the ‘‘most Catholic’’ monarchs had achieved their
goal of absolute religious orthodoxy as a basic ingredient
of the Spanish state. To be Spanish was to be Catholic, a
policy of uniformity enforced by the Inquisition.

Central Europe: The Holy Roman Empire

After 1438, the position of Holy Roman Emperor was in
the hands of the Habsburg dynasty. Having gradually acquired a number of possessions along the Danube, known
collectively as Austria, the house of Habsburg had become
one of the wealthiest landholders in the empire and by the
mid-fifteenth century began to play an important role in
European affairs. Much of the Habsburg success in the
fifteenth century was due not to military victories but to a
well-executed policy of dynastic marriages.

Much was expected of the flamboyant Maximilian I
(1493--1519) when he became emperor. Through the
Reichstag, the imperial diet or parliament, Maximilian
attempted to centralize the administration by creating
new institutions common to the entire empire. Opposition from the German princes doomed these efforts,
however. Maximilian’s only real success lay in his marriage
alliances, which led to a grandson, Charles V, inheriting
the traditional lands of the Habsburg, Burgundian, and
Spanish monarchical lines at the beginning of the sixteenth century, making him the leading monarch of his
age (see Chapter 13).

The Struggle for Strong Monarchy
in Eastern Europe

In eastern Europe, rulers struggled to achieve the centralization of their territorial states but faced serious obstacles. Although the population was mostly Slavic, there
were islands of other ethnic groups that caused difficulties.
Religious differences also troubled the area, as Roman
Catholics, Greek Orthodox Christians, and pagans came
into conflict.

Much of Polish history revolved around a bitter
struggle between the crown and the landed nobility until
the end of the fifteenth century, when the preoccupation
of the Polish monarchy with problems in Bohemia and
Hungary as well as war with the Russians and Turks
enabled the aristocrats to reestablish their power.
Through their control of the Sejm, the national parliament, the magnates reduced the peasantry to serfdom by
1511 and established the right to elect their kings. The
Polish kings proved unable to establish a strong royal
authority.

Since the conversion of Hungary to Roman Catholicism by German missionaries, its history had been closely
tied to that of central and western Europe. The church
became a large and prosperous institution. Wealthy bishops, along with great territorial lords, became powerful,
independent political figures. For a brief while, Hungary
developed into an important European state, the dominant power in eastern Europe. King Matthias Corvinus
(1458--1490) broke the power of the wealthy lords and
created a well-organized central administration. After his
death, Hungary returned to weak rule, however, and the
work of Corvinus was largely undone.

Since the thirteenth century, Russia had been under
the domination of the Mongols. Gradually, the princes of
Moscow rose to prominence by using their close relationship to the Mongol khans to increase their wealth and
expand their possessions. In the reign of the great prince
Ivan III (1462--1505), a new Russian state was born. Ivan
III annexed other Russian principalities and took advantage of dissension among the Mongols to throw off
their yoke by 1480.

The Ottoman Turks and the End
of the Byzantine Empire

Eastern Europe was increasingly threatened by the
steadily advancing Ottoman Turks. The Byzantine Empire
had served as a buffer between the Muslim Middle East
and the Latin West for centuries, but it was severely
weakened by the sack of Constantinople in 1204 and its
occupation by the West. Although the Paleologus dynasty
(1260--1453) had tried to reestablish Byzantine power in
the Balkans, the threat from the Turks finally doomed the
long-lasting empire.

Beginning in northeastern Asia Minor in the thirteenth century, the Ottoman Turks spread rapidly, seizing
the lands of the Seljuk Turks and the Byzantine Empire.
In 1345, they bypassed Constantinople and moved into
the Balkans. Under Sultan Murad, Ottoman forces moved
through Bulgaria and into the lands of the Serbians, who
provided a strong center of opposition under King Lazar.
But in 1389, at the Battle of Kosovo, Ottoman forces
defeated the Serbs; both King Lazar and Sultan Murad
perished in the battle. Kosovo became a battlefield long
revered and remembered by the Serbs. Not until 1480
were Bosnia, Albania, and the rest of Serbia added to the
Ottoman Empire in the Balkans.

In the meantime, in 1453, the Ottomans also completed the demise of the Byzantine Empire. With eighty
thousand troops ranged against only seven thousand
defenders, Sultan Mehmet II laid siege to Constantinople.
In their attack on the city, the Turks made use of massive
cannons with 26-foot barrels that could launch stone
balls weighing up to 1,200 pounds each. Finally, the walls
were breached; the Byzantine emperor died in the final
battle. Mehmet II, standing before the palace of the
emperor, paused to reflect on the passing nature of human glory.

After consolidating their power, the Turks prepared
to exert renewed pressure on the West, both in the
Mediterranean and up the Danube valley toward Vienna.
By the end of the fifteenth century, they were threatening
Hungary, Austria, Bohemia, and Poland.

The Church in the Renaissance

Q Focus Question: What were the policies of the
Renaissance popes, and what impact did those policies
have on the Roman Catholic Church?

As a result of the efforts of the Council of Constance, the
Great Schism of the Catholic church had finally been
brought to an end in 1417. Ending the schism proved to
be the council’s easiest task; it was much less successful in
dealing with the problems of heresy and reform.

The Problems of Heresy and Reform

Heresy was not a new problem, and in the thirteenth
century, the church had developed inquisitorial machinery to deal with it. But two widespread movements in the
fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries---Lollardy and
Hussitism---posed new threats to the church.

Wyclif and Lollardy

English Lollardy was a product of
the Oxford theologian John Wyclif (c. 1328--1384),
whose disgust with clerical corruption led him to a farranging attack on papal authority and medieval Christian beliefs and practices. Wyclif alleged that there was
no basis in Scripture for papal claims of temporal authority and advocated that the popes be stripped of their
authority and their property. Believing that the Bible
should be a Christian’s sole authority, Wyclif urged that
it be made available in the vernacular languages so that
every Christian could read it. Rejecting all practices not
mentioned in Scripture, Wyclif condemned pilgrimages
and the veneration of saints. Wyclif attracted a number
of followers who came to be known as Lollards (literally,
‘‘mutterers’’).

Hus and the Hussites

A marriage between the royal
families of England and Bohemia enabled Lollard ideas
to spread to Bohemia, where they reinforced the ideas of
a group of Czech reformers led by the chancellor of the
university at Prague, John Hus (1374--1415). In his call
for reform, Hus urged the elimination of the worldliness and corruption of the clergy and attacked the excessive power of the papacy within the Catholic church.
Hus’s objections fell on receptive ears, for the Catholic
church, as one of the largest landowners in Bohemia,
was already widely criticized. Moreover, many clergymen were German, and the native Czechs’ strong resentment of the Germans who dominated Bohemia also
contributed to Hus’s movement.

The Council of Constance attempted to deal with the
growing problem of heresy by summoning Hus to appear
before it. Granted safe conduct by Emperor Sigismund,
Hus went in the hope of a free hearing of his ideas. Instead
he was arrested, condemned as a heretic, and burned at
the stake in 1415. This action turned the unrest in Bohemia into revolutionary upheaval, and the resulting
Hussite wars racked the Holy Roman Empire until a truce
was arranged in 1436.

Reform of the Church

The reform of the church was
even less successful than the attempt to eradicate heresy.
The Council of Constance passed two reform decrees.
One stated that a general council of the church received
its authority from God; hence every Christian, including
the pope, was subject to its authority. The other decree
provided for the regular holding of general councils to
ensure that church reform would continue. Decrees
alone, however, proved insufficient to reform the church.
Councils could issue decrees, but popes had to execute
them, and popes would not cooperate with councils that
diminished their absolute authority. Beginning already
in 1417, successive popes worked steadfastly for the next
thirty years to defeat the conciliar movement (see
Chapter 11).

By the mid-fifteenth century, the popes had reasserted their supremacy over the Roman Catholic
Church. No longer, however, did they have any possibility
of asserting supremacy over temporal governments as the
medieval papacy had. Although the papal monarchy had
been maintained, it had lost much moral prestige. In the
fifteenth century, the Renaissance papacy contributed to
an even further decline in the moral leadership of the
popes.

The Renaissance Papacy

The Renaissance papacy refers to the line of popes from
the end of the Great Schism in 1417 to the beginning
of the Reformation in the early sixteenth century. The
primary concern of the papacy is governing the Roman
Catholic Church as its spiritual leader. But as heads of the
church, popes had temporal preoccupations as well, and
the story of the Renaissance papacy is really an account of
how the latter came to overshadow the popes’ spiritual
functions.

The manner in which Renaissance popes pursued
their interests in the Papal States and Italian politics,
especially their use of intrigue and even bloodshed,
seemed shocking. Of all the Renaissance popes, Julius II
(1503--1513) was most involved in war and politics. The
fiery ‘‘warrior pope’’ personally led armies against his enemies, much to the disgust of pious Christians, who viewed
the pope as a spiritual leader. As one intellectual wrote at
the beginning of the sixteenth century: ‘‘How, O bishop
standing in the room of the Apostles [the pope], dare you
teach the people the things that pertain to war?’’

To further their territorial aims in the Papal States,
the popes needed loyal servants. Because they were not
hereditary monarchs, popes could not build dynasties
over several generations and came to rely on the practice
of nepotism to promote their families’ interests. Pope
Sixtus IV (1471--1484), for example, made five of his
nephews cardinals (the word nepotism is in fact derived
from the Greek nepos, meaning ‘‘nephew’’) and gave them
an abundance of church offices to build up their finances.
The infamous Borgia pope, Alexander VI (1492--1503),
known for his debauchery and sensuality, raised one son,
one nephew, and the brother of one mistress to the cardinalate. Alexander scandalized the church by encouraging his son Cesare to carve a state out of the territories of
the Papal States in central Italy.

The Renaissance popes were great patrons of Renaissance culture, and their efforts made Rome a cultural
leader at the beginning of the sixteenth century. The
warrior pope Julius II endeavored to add to the splendor
of his pontificate by tearing down an old church and
beginning construction of what was to be the greatest
building in Christendom, Saint Peter’s Basilica. Julius’s
successor, Leo X (1513--1521), was also a patron of Renaissance culture. A member of the Medici family, he was
made a cardinal at the age of thirteen and acquired a
refined taste in art, manners, and social life among the
Florentine elite. He became pope at the age of thirtyseven, supposedly remarking to the Venetian ambassador,
‘‘Let us enjoy the papacy, since God has given it to us.’’
Raphael was commissioned to do paintings, and the
construction of Saint Peter’s was accelerated as Rome
became the literary and artistic center of the Renaissance.

CONCLUSION

The Renaissance was a period of transition that extended most of
the economic, political, and social trends that had begun in the
High Middle Ages. It was also a movement in which intellectuals
and artists proclaimed a new vision of humankind and raised
fundamental questions about the value and importance of the
individual. Of course, intellectuals and artists wrote and painted for
the upper classes, and the brilliant intellectual, cultural, and artistic
accomplishments of the Renaissance were really products of and for
the elite. The ideas of the Renaissance did not have a broad base
among the masses of the people. As Lorenzo the Magnificent, ruler
of Florence, once commented, ‘‘Only men of noble birth can obtain
perfection. The poor, who work with their hands and have no time
to cultivate their minds, are incapable of it.’’

The Renaissance did, however, raise new questions about
medieval traditions. In criticizing current religious practices, the
humanists raised fundamental issues about the Catholic church,
which was still an influential institution. As we shall see in the next
chapter, the intellectual revolution of the fifteenth century gave way
to a religious renaissance that touched the lives of people, including
the masses, in new and profound ways. After the Reformation,
Europe would never again be the unified Christian commonwealth
it once believed it was.
