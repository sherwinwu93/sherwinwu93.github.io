<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge6b325f">
<p class="verse">
In 1849,<br />
&#xa0;a daring young Englishman made a hazardous journey into the deserts and swamps of southern Iraq.<br />
Moving south down the banks of the Euphrates River<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;while braving high winds and temperatures that reached 120 degrees Fahrenheit,<br />
&#xa0;William Loftus led a small expedition in search of the roots of civilization.<br />
As he said,<br />
&#xa0;'From our childhood we have been led to regard this place as the cradle of the human race.'<br />
<br />
Guided by native Arabs into the southernmost reaches of Iraq,<br />
&#xa0;Loftus and his small group of explorers were soon overwhelmed by what they saw.<br />
He wrote,<br />
&#xa0;'I know of nothing more exciting or impressive than the first sight of one of these great piles,<br />
&#xa0;looming in solitary grandeur from the surrounding plains and marshes.'<br />
One of these piles, known to the natives as the mound of Warka,<br />
&#xa0;contained the ruins of Uruk,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;one of the first cities in the world and part of the world's first civilization.<br />
<br />
Southwest Asia was one area in the world where civilization began.<br />
Although Western civilization did not yet exist,<br />
&#xa0;its origins can be traced back to the ancient Near East,<br />
&#xa0;where people in Southwest Asia and in Egypt, in northeastern Africa,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;developed organized societies, invented writing,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and created the ideas and institutions that we associate with civilization.<br />
The later Greeks and Romans<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;who played such a crucial role in the development of Western civilization,<br />
&#xa0;were nourished and influenced by these older Near Eastern societies.<br />
It is appropriate, therefore,<br />
&#xa0;to begin our story of Western civilization<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;with the early civilizations of Southwest Asia and Egypt.<br />
Before considering them, however,<br />
&#xa0;we must briefly examine prehistory<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and observe how human beings made the shift from hunting and gathering<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;to agricultural communities and ultimately to cities and civilization.<br />

In 1849, a daring Englishman led a small expedition into the desert and swamps of the Iraq,<br />
	which is regarded as the cradle of the human race.<br />
Into the southernmost reaches of the Iraq,<br />
	he and his group of explorers were overwhelmed by what they saw,<br />
	one of the great piles looming in grandeur from the surrouding plains and marshes.<br />
One of these piles called the mound of Warka contained the ruin of Uruk,<br />
	one of the first cities in the world and part of the world's first civilization.<br />
The origins of Western Civilization can be traced back to the ancient near Nest.<br />
The later Greeks and Romans who play a crucial role in Western Civilization<br />
	were nourished and influenced by these older near Nest socities.<br />
Therefore, it is appropriate to begin our story with the ancient Near Nest.<br />
Before that, we must briefly examine prehistory<br />
	and obverse how human being made the shift from hunting and gathering<br />
		to agricultural communities and ultimately to cities and cilivization.<br />
