Mass burial and cremation of plague victims

AS A RESULT of their conquests in the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries, the Mongols assembled a vast empire stretching from
Russia in the west to China in the east. Mongol rule brought stability to the Eurasian trade routes; increased trade brought prosperity
but also avenues for the spread of flea-infested rats that carried bubonic plague to both East Asia and Europe. In the mid-fourteenth
century, one of the most destructive natural disasters in history
erupted---the Black Death. One contemporary observer named
Henry Knighton, a canon of Saint Mary-of-the-Meadow Abbey in
Leicester, England, was simply overwhelmed by the magnitude of
the catastrophe. Knighton began his account of the great plague
with these words: ‘‘In this year [1348] and in the following one
there was a general mortality of people throughout the whole
world.’’ Few were left untouched; the plague struck even isolated
monasteries: ‘‘At Montpellier, there remained out of a hundred and
forty friars only seven.’’ Knighton was also stunned by the economic
and social consequences of the Black Death. Prices dropped: ‘‘And
the price of everything was cheap, because of the fear of death; there
were very few who took any care for their wealth, or for anything
else.’’ Meanwhile, laborers were scarce, so their wages increased: ‘‘In
the following autumn, one could not hire a reaper at a lower wage
than eight pence with food, or a mower at less than twelve pence
with food. Because of this, much grain rotted in the fields for lack
of harvesting.’’ So many people died that some towns were deserted
and some villages disappeared altogether: ‘‘Many small villages and
hamlets were completely deserted; there was not one house left in
them, but all those who had lived in them were dead.’’ Some people
thought the end of the world was at hand.

Plague was not the only disaster in the fourteenth century,
however. Signs of disintegration were everywhere: famine, economic
depression, war, social upheaval, a rise in crime and violence, and a
decline in the power of the universal Catholic church. Periods of disintegration, however, are often fertile grounds for change and new
developments. Out of the dissolution of medieval civilization came a
rebirth of culture that has come to be known as the Renaissance.

A Time of Troubles: Black Death
and Social Crisis

Q Focus Question: What impact did the Black Death
have on the society and economy of Europe?

For much of the thirteenth century, Europe had experienced good harvests and an expanding population. By
century’s end, however, a succession of disastrous events
had begun.

For one thing, there were noticeable changes in weather
patterns as Europe entered a ‘‘little ice age.’’ Shortened
growing seasons and miserable weather conditions, including
heavy storms and constant rain, led to widespread famine
and hunger. The great famine of 1315--1317 in northern
Europe began an all-too-familiar pattern, as is evident in
this scene described by a contemporary chronicler:

We saw a larger number of both sexes, not only from nearby
places but from as much as five leagues away, barefooted and
maybe even, except for women, in a completely nude state,
together with their priests coming in procession at the
Church of the Holy Martyrs, their bones bulging out, devoutly carrying bodies of saints and other relics to be
adorned hoping to get relief.

Some historians have pointed out that famine could have
led to chronic malnutrition, which in turn contributed to
increased infant mortality, lower birthrates, and higher
susceptibility to disease because malnourished people are
less able to resist infection. This, they argue, helps explain
the virulence of the great plague known as the Black Death.

The Black Death

The Black Death of the mid-fourteenth century was the
most devastating natural disaster in European history,
ravaging the population and causing economic, social,
political, and cultural upheaval. Contemporary chroniclers lamented how parents abandoned their children;
one related the words: ‘‘Oh father, why have you abandoned me?. . . Mother, where have you gone?’’2 People
were horrified by an evil force they could not understand
and by the subsequent breakdown of all normal human
relations.

Bubonic plague, the most common form of plague at
the time, was spread by black rats infested with fleas that
were host to the deadly bacterium Yersinia pestis. Symptoms of bubonic plague included high fever, aching joints,
swelling of the lymph nodes, and dark blotches caused by
bleeding beneath the skin. Bubonic plague was actually
the least toxic form of plague but nevertheless killed 50 to
60 percent of its victims. In pneumonic plague, the bacterial infection spread to the lungs, resulting in severe
coughing, bloody sputum, and the relatively easy spread
of the bacillus from human to human by coughing.

Spread of the Plague

The Black Death was the first
major epidemic disease to strike Europe in seven centuries, an absence that helps explain medieval Europe’s remarkable population growth. Having disappeared from
Europe and the Middle East in the Middle Ages, bubonic
plague continued to haunt parts of southwestern China,
especially isolated rural territories. The arrival of Mongol
troops in this area in the mid-thirteenth century became
the means for the spread of the plague as flea-infested rats
accompanied the Mongols into central and northwestern
China and Central Asia. From there, trading caravans
brought the plague to Caffa on the Black Sea in 1346.

The plague reached Europe in October 1347 when
Genoese merchants brought it from Caffa to the island of
Sicily off the coast of southern Italy. It quickly spread to
southern Italy and southern France and Spain by the end
of 1347 (see Map 11.1). Diffusion of the Black Death
followed commercial trade routes. In 1348, the plague
spread through France and the Low Countries and into
Germany. By the end of that year, it had moved to England, ravaging it in 1349. By the end of 1349, the plague
had reached Scandinavia. Eastern Europe and Russia were
affected by 1351, although mortality rates were never as
high there as they were in western and central Europe.

Mortality figures for the Black Death were incredibly
high. Italy was especially hard hit. Its crowded cities
suffered losses of 50 to 60 percent (see the box on p. 223).
In northern France, farming villages suffered mortality
rates of 30 percent, and cities such as Rouen experienced
losses as high as 40 percent. In England and Germany,
entire villages disappeared. In Germany, of approximately
170,000 inhabited locations, 40,000 had disappeared by
the end of the fourteenth century.

It has been estimated that the European population
declined by 25 to 50 percent between 1347 and 1351. If we
accept the recent scholarly assessment of a European
population of 75 million in the early fourteenth century,
this means a death toll of 19 to 38 million people in four
years. And the plague did not end in 1351. There were
major outbreaks again in 1361--1362 and 1369 and then
regular recurrences during the remainder of the fourteenth
century and all of the fifteenth century. The European
population did not start to recover until the end of the
fifteenth century; not until the mid-sixteenth century did
Europe return to thirteenth-century population levels.

Life and Death: Reactions to the Plague

Attempts to
explain the Black Death and mitigate its harshness led to
extreme sorts of behavior. Many people believed that the
plague had either been sent by God as a punishment for
humans’ sins or been caused by the devil. Some resorted
to extreme asceticism to cleanse themselves of sin and
gain God’s forgiveness. Such was the flagellant movement, which became popular in 1348, especially in
Germany. Groups of flagellants, both men and women,
wandered from town to town, flogging each other with
whips to win the forgiveness of a God whom they
felt had sent the plague to punish humans for their
sinful ways. One contemporary chronicler described a
flagellant procession:

The penitents went about, coming first out of Germany.
They were men who did public penance and scourged themselves with whips of hard knotted leather with little iron
spikes. Some made themselves bleed very badly between the
shoulder blades and some foolish women had cloths ready to
catch the blood and smear it on their eyes, saying it was miraculous blood. While they were doing penance, they sang
very mournful songs about the nativity and the passion of
Our Lord. The object of this penance was to put a stop to
the mortality, for in that time . . . at least a third of all the
people in the world died.3

The flagellants attracted attention and caused mass
hysteria wherever they went. The Catholic church,
however, became alarmed when flagellant groups began
to kill Jews and attack the clergy who opposed them. Pope
Clement VI condemned the flagellants in October 1349
and urged the public authorities to crush them. By the
end of 1350, most of the flagellant movements had been
destroyed.

Virulent anti-Semitism accompanied the Black
Death. Jews were accused of causing the plague by poisoning town wells. Although Jews were persecuted in
Spain, the worst pogroms against this helpless minority
were carried out in Germany; more than sixty major
Jewish communities in Germany had been exterminated
by 1351. Many Jews fled eastward to Russia and especially
to Poland, where the king offered them protection.
Eastern Europe became home to large Jewish communities.

The prevalence of death because of the plague and its
recurrences affected people in profound ways. Some
survivors apparently came to treat life as something
cheap and passing. Violence and violent death appeared
to be more common after the plague than before. Postplague Europe also demonstrated a morbid preoccupation with death. In their sermons, priests reminded
parishioners that each night’s sleep might be their last.
Tombstones were decorated with macabre scenes of naked
corpses in various stages of decomposition with snakes
entwined in their bones and their innards filled with
worms.

Economic Dislocation and Social Upheaval

The population collapse of the fourteenth century had
dire economic and social consequences. Economic distress brought social upheaval. Both peasants and noble
landlords were affected. A serious labor shortage caused a
dramatic rise in the price of labor. At Cuxham Manor in
England, for example, a farm laborer who had received 2
shillings a week in 1347 was paid 7 in 1349 and almost 11
by 1350. At the same time, the decline in population
depressed the demand for agricultural produce, resulting
in falling prices for output. Because landlords were having
to pay more for labor at the same time that their income
from rents was declining, they began to endure economic
hardship and lower standards of living. In England, aristocratic incomes dropped more than 20 percent between
1347 and 1353.

Landed aristocrats responded by seeking to lower the
wage rate. The English Parliament passed the Statute of
Laborers (1351), which attempted to limit wages to preplague levels and to forbid the mobility of peasants as
well. Although such laws proved largely unworkable, they
did keep wages from rising as high as they might have in a
free market. Overall, the position of noble landlords
continued to deteriorate during the late fourteenth and
early fifteenth centuries. At the same time, the position of
peasants improved, though not uniformly throughout
Europe.

The decline in the number of peasants after the Black
Death accelerated the process of converting labor services
to rents, freeing peasants from the obligations of servile
tenure and weakening the system of manorialism. But
there were limits to how much the peasants could advance. They faced the same economic hurdles as the lords,
while the latter also attempted to impose wage restrictions and reinstate old forms of labor service. New
governmental taxes also hurt. Peasant complaints became
widespread and soon gave rise to rural revolts.

Peasant Revolts

In 1358, a peasant revolt known as the
Jacquerie broke out in northern France. The destruction of
normal order by the Black Death and the subsequent
economic dislocation were important factors in causing
the revolt, but the ravages created by the Hundred Years’
War (see ‘‘War and Political Instability’’ later in this
chapter) also affected the French peasantry. Both the
French and English forces followed a deliberate policy of
laying waste to peasants’ lands while bands of mercenaries
lived off the land by taking peasants’ produce as well.

Peasant anger was also exacerbated by growing class
tensions. Many aristocrats looked on peasants with utter
contempt. One French aristocrat said, ‘‘Should peasants
eat meat? Rather should they chew grass on the heath
with the horned cattle and go naked on all fours.’’ The
peasants reciprocated this contempt for their so-called
social superiors.

The outburst of peasant anger led to savage confrontations. Castles were burned and nobles murdered.
Such atrocities did not go unanswered, however. The
Jacquerie failed when the privileged classes closed ranks,
savagely massacred the rebels, and ended the revolt.

The English Peasants’ Revolt of 1381 was the most
prominent of all. It was a product not of desperation but
of rising expectations. After the Black Death, the condition of the English peasants had improved as they enjoyed
greater freedom and higher wages or lower rents. Aristocratic landlords had fought back with legislation to
depress wages and an attempt to reimpose old feudal
dues. The most immediate cause of the revolt, however,
was the monarchy’s attempt to raise revenues by imposing
a poll tax, a flat charge on each adult member of the
population. Peasants in eastern England, the wealthiest
part of the country, refused to pay the tax and expelled
the collectors forcibly from their villages.

This action produced a widespread rebellion of both
peasants and townspeople led by a well-to-do peasant
called Wat Tyler and a preacher named John Ball. The
latter preached an effective message against the noble
class, as recounted by the chronicler Froissart:

Good people, things cannot go right in England and never
will, until goods are held in common and there are no more
peasants and gentlefolk, but we are all one and the same. In
what way are those whom we call lords greater masters than
ourselves? How have they deserved it? Why do they hold us
in bondage? If we all spring from a single father and mother,
Adam and Eve, how can they claim or prove that they are
lords more than us, except by making us produce and grow
the wealth which they spend?

The revolt was initially successful as the rebels burned
down the manor houses of aristocrats, lawyers, and
government officers and murdered several important officials, including the archbishop of Canterbury. After the
peasants marched on London, the young King Richard II
(1377--1399) promised to grant the rebels’ demands if
they returned to their homes. They accepted the king’s
word and dispersed, but the king reneged and, with the
assistance of the aristocrats, arrested hundreds of the
rebels. The poll tax was eliminated, however.

Revolts in the Cities

Revolts also erupted in the cities.
Commercial and industrial activity suffered almost immediately from the Black Death. Florence’s woolen industry, one of the giants, produced 70,000 to 80,000 pieces
of cloth in 1338; in 1378, it was yielding only 24,000 pieces.
Bourgeois merchants and manufacturers responded to a
decline in trade and production by attempts to restrict
competition and resist the demands of the lower classes.

In urban areas, where capitalist industrialists paid
low wages and managed to prevent workers from forming
organizations to help themselves, industrial revolts broke
out throughout Europe. Most famous was the revolt of
Florence’s wool workers, the ciompi, in 1378. In the 1370s,
the woolen industry was depressed, and wool workers saw
their real wages decline when the coinage in which they
were paid was debased. Their revolt won them some
concessions from the municipal government, including
the right to form guilds and be represented in the government. But their newly won rights were short-lived.
A counterrevolution by government authorities brought
an end to ciompi participation in the government by 1382.

Although the peasant and urban revolts sometimes
resulted in short-term gains for the participants, the
uprisings were relatively easily crushed and their gains
quickly lost. Accustomed to ruling, the established classes
easily combined and quashed dissent. Nevertheless, the
rural and urban revolts of the fourteenth century ushered
in a spirit of social conflict that characterized much of
later European history.

War and Political Instability

Q Focus Question: What major problems did European
states face in the fourteenth century?

Famine, plague, economic turmoil, social upheaval, and
violence were not the only problems of the fourteenth
century. War and political instability must also be
added to the list. And of all the struggles of the period,
the most famous and the most violent was the Hundred
Years’ War.

The Hundred Years’ War

In the thirteenth century, the English king still held one
small possession in France, known as the duchy of
Gascony. As duke of Gascony, the English king pledged
loyalty as a vassal to the French king. But when King
Philip VI of France seized Gascony in 1337, the duke of
Gascony---King Edward III of England---declared war on
Philip. The attack on Gascony was a convenient excuse;
Edward had already laid claim to the throne of France
after the senior branch of the Capetian dynasty had become extinct in 1328 and a cousin of the Capetians, the
duke of Valois, had become king as Philip VI.

The war began in a burst of knightly enthusiasm.
Trained to be warriors, knights viewed the clash of battle
as the ultimate opportunity to demonstrate their fighting abilities. But this struggle would change the nature
of warfare, for as it dragged on, the outcomes of battles
were increasingly determined not by knights but by
peasant foot soldiers. The French army of 1337, with its
heavily armed noble cavalry, resembled its twelfth- and
thirteenth-century forebears. Considering themselves
the fighting elite, the noble cavalry looked with contempt on foot soldiers and crossbowmen because they
were peasants or other social inferiors. The English
army, however, had evolved differently and had included
peasants as paid foot soldiers. Armed with pikes, many
of these foot soldiers had also adopted the longbow,
invented by the Welsh. The longbow had greater striking
power, longer range, and more rapid speed of fire than
the crossbow. Although the English also used heavily
armed cavalry, they relied even more on large numbers
of foot soldiers.

Course of the War

Edward III’s early campaigns in
France were indecisive and achieved little. In 1346, Edward was forced to fight at Cre´cy, just south of Flanders.
The larger French army followed no battle plan but
simply attacked the English lines in a disorderly fashion.
The arrows of the English archers decimated the French
cavalry. As the chronicler Froissart described it, ‘‘The
English continued to shoot into the thickest part of the
crowd, wasting none of their arrows. They impaled or
wounded horses and riders, who fell to the ground in
great distress, unable to get up again without the help of
several men.’’5 It was a stunning victory for the English.

The Battle of Cre´cy was not decisive, however. The
English simply did not possess the resources to subjugate
all France, and hostilities continued intermittently for
another fifty years until a truce was negotiated in 1396,
seemingly bringing an end to this protracted series of
struggles between the French and English.

In 1415, however, the English king, Henry V (1413--
1422), went back on the offensive at the very time the
French were enduring a civil war in which the dukes of
Burgundy and Orle´ans competed to control the weak
French king, Charles VI. In the summer of 1413, Paris
exploded with bloody encounters. Taking advantage of
the chaos, Henry V invaded France in 1415. At the Battle
of Agincourt (1415), the French suffered a disastrous
defeat, and fifteen hundred French nobles died when the
heavy, armor-plated French knights attempted to attack
across a field turned to mud by heavy rain. Altogether,
French losses were six thousand dead; the English lost
only three hundred men. Henry went on to reconquer
Normandy and forge an alliance with the duke of Burgundy, making the English masters of northern France
(see Map 11.2).

The seemingly hopeless French cause fell into the
hands of Charles the dauphin (heir to the throne), the son
of Charles VI. The dauphin governed the southern twothirds of French lands from Bourges. Charles, weak and
timid, was unable to rally the French against the English,
who in 1428 had turned south and were besieging the
city of Orle´ans to gain access to the valley of the Loire.
The French monarch was saved, quite unexpectedly, by a
French peasant woman.

Joan of Arc

Joan of Arc was born in 1412 to well-to-do
peasants in the village of Domre´my in Champagne.
Deeply religious, Joan experienced visions and came to
believe that her favorite saints had commanded her to
free France and have the dauphin crowned king. In
February 1429, Joan made her way to the dauphin’s court,
where her sincerity and simplicity persuaded Charles to
allow her to accompany a French army to Orle´ans. Apparently inspired by the faith of the peasant girl, the
French armies found new confidence in themselves and
liberated Orle´ans, changing the course of the war. Within
a few weeks, the entire Loire valley had been freed of the
English. Joan had brought the war to a decisive turning
point.

But she did not live to see the war concluded. Captured by the Burgundian allies of the English in 1430,
Joan was turned over first to the English and then to the
Inquisition on charges of witchcraft (see the box on 228).
In the fifteenth century, spiritual visions were thought to
be inspired either by God or the devil. Because Joan
dressed in men’s clothing, it was relatively easy to convince others that she was in league with the ‘‘prince of
darkness.’’ She was condemned to death as a heretic and
burned at the stake in 1431. To the end, as the flames rose
up around her, she declared ‘‘that her voices came from
God and had not deceived her.’’ Twenty-five years later, a
new ecclesiastical court exonerated her of these charges,
and five centuries later, in 1920, she was made a saint of
the Roman Catholic Church. Joan of Arc’s accomplishments proved decisive.

End of the War

Although the war dragged on for another two decades, defeats of English armies in Normandy and Aquitaine led to French victory. Important to
the French success was the use of the cannon, a new
weapon made possible by the invention of gunpowder.
The Chinese had invented gunpowder in the eleventh
century and devised a simple cannon by the thirteenth.
The Mongols greatly improved this technology, developing more accurate cannons and cannonballs; both spread
to the Middle East by the thirteenth century and to Europe by the fourteenth.

The death of England’s best commanders and the
instability of the English government under King Henry
VI (1422--1461) also contributed to England’s defeat. By
1453, the only part of France that was left in England’s
hands was the coastal town of Calais, which remained
English for another century.

Political Instability

The fourteenth century was a period of adversity for the
internal political stability of European governments. Although government bureaucracies grew ever larger, at the
same time the question of who should control the bureaucracies led to internal conflict and instability. Like the
lord and serf relationship, the lord and vassal relationship
based on land and military service was being replaced by
a contract based on money. Especially after the Black
Death, money payments called scutage were increasingly
substituted for military service. Monarchs welcomed this
development because they could now hire professional
soldiers, who tended to be more reliable anyway. As lord
and vassal relationships became less personal and less
important, new relationships based on political advantage
began to be formed, creating new avenues for political
influence---and for corruption as well. Especially noticeable, as the landed aristocrats suffered declining rents and
social uncertainties with the new relationships, was the
formation of factions of nobles who looked for opportunities to advance their power and wealth at the expense
of other noble factions and of their monarchs. Others
went to the royal courts, offering to serve the kings.

The kings had their own problems, however. By
the mid-fifteenth century, reigning monarchs in many
European countries were not the direct descendants of
those ruling in 1300. The founders of these new dynasties
had to struggle for position as factions of nobles vied to
gain material advantages for themselves. At the end of the
fourteenth century and beginning of the fifteenth, there
were two claimants to the throne of France, and two aristocratic factions fought for control of England; in Germany, three princes struggled to be recognized as emperor.

Fourteenth-century monarchs, of old and new dynasties alike, faced financial problems as well. The shift to
the use of mercenary soldiers left monarchs perennially
short of cash. Traditional revenues, especially rents from
property, increasingly proved insufficient to meet their
needs. Monarchs attempted to generate new sources of
revenues, especially through taxes, which often meant
going through parliaments. This opened the door for
parliamentary bodies to gain more power by asking for
favors first. Although unsuccessful in most cases, the active role of parliaments added another element of uncertainty and confusion to fourteenth-century politics.
Turning now to a survey of western and central European
states, we can see how these disruptive factors worked.

Western Europe: England and France

In the fourteenth century, the lengthy reign of Edward III
(1327--1377) was important for the evolution of English
political institutions. Parliament increased in prominence
and developed its basic structure and functions during
Edward’s reign. Due to his constant need for money to
fight the Hundred Years’ War, Edward came to rely on
Parliament to levy new taxes. In return for regular grants,
Edward made several concessions, including a commitment to levy no direct tax without Parliament’s consent
and to allow committees of Parliament to examine the
government accounts to ensure that the money was being
spent properly. By the end of Edward’s reign, Parliament
had become an important component of the English
governmental system.

During this same period, Parliament began to assume
the organizational structure it has retained to this day.
The Great Council of barons became the House of Lords
and evolved into a body composed of the chief bishops
and abbots of the realm and aristocratic peers whose
position in Parliament was hereditary. The representatives
of the shires and boroughs, who were considered less
important than the lay and ecclesiastical lords, held collective meetings to decide policy and soon came to be
regarded as the House of Commons. Together, the House
of Lords and the House of Commons constituted Parliament. Although the House of Commons did little beyond approving measures proposed by the Lords, during
Edward’s reign the Commons did begin the practice of
drawing up petitions, which, if accepted by the Lords and
king, became law.

After Edward III’s death, England began to experience the internal instability of aristocratic factionalism
that was racking other European countries. After Richard II
was deposed in 1399 and killed, the leader of the revolt
of the barons, Henry of Lancaster, was made king. Although Henry IV (1399--1413) proved to be a competent
ruler, factions of nobles rose to take advantage of the
situation. England would soon be embroiled in a devastating series of civil wars known as the War of the
Roses.

The Hundred Years’ War left France prostrate. Depopulation, desolated farmlands, ruined commerce, and
independent and unruly nobles made it difficult for the
kings to assert their authority throughout the fourteenth
century. The insanity of King Charles VI (1380--1422)
especially opened the door to rival factions of French
nobles aspiring to power and wealth. The dukes of Burgundy and Orle´ans competed to control Charles and the
French monarchy. Their struggles created chaos for the
French government and the French people. Many nobles
supported the Orle´anist faction; Paris and other towns
favored the Burgundians. By the beginning of the fifteenth
century, France seemed hopelessly mired in civil war.

The German Monarchy

England and France had developed strong national
monarchies in the High Middle Ages. By the end of the
fourteenth century, they seemed in danger of disintegrating due to dynastic problems and the pressures
generated by the Hundred Years’ War. In contrast, the
Holy Roman Empire, whose core consisted of the lands of
Germany, had already begun to fall apart in the High
Middle Ages. Northern Italy, which the German emperors
had tried to include in their medieval empire, had been
free from any real imperial control since the end of the
Hohenstaufen dynasty in the thirteenth century. In
Germany itself, the failure of the Hohenstaufens ended
any chance of centralized monarchical
authority, and Germany became a land
of hundreds of states
that varied in size
and power. These
included princely
states, such as the
duchies of Bavaria
and Saxony; free
imperial city-states
(self-governing cities
directly under the
control of the Holy
Roman Emperor
rather than a German territorial prince), such as Nuremberg; modest territories of petty imperial knights; and
ecclesiastical states, such as the archbishopric of Cologne.
In the ecclesiastical states, a high church official, such as a
bishop, archbishop, or abbot, served in a dual capacity as
an administrative official of the Catholic church and
secular lord over the territories of the state. Although all
of the rulers of these different states had some obligations
to the German king and Holy Roman Emperor, more and
more they acted independently.

Because of its unique pattern of development in the
High Middle Ages, the German monarchy had become established on an elective rather than hereditary basis. This
principle of election was standardized in 1356 by the Golden
Bull issued by Emperor Charles IV (1346--1378). This edict
stated that four lay princes and three ecclesiastical rulers
would serve as electors with the legal power to elect the
‘‘king of the Romans and future emperor, to be ruler of the
world and of the Christian people.’’ ‘‘King of the Romans’’
was the official title of the German king; after his imperial
coronation, he would also have the title of emperor.

In the fourteenth century, the electoral principle further ensured that kings of Germany were generally weak.
Their ability to exercise effective power depended on the
extent of their own family possessions. At the beginning of
the fifteenth century, three emperors claimed the throne.
Although the dispute was quickly settled, Germany entered
the fifteenth century in a condition that verged on anarchy.
Princes fought princes and leagues of cities. The emperors
were virtually powerless to control any of them.

The States of Italy

By the fourteenth century, Italy, too, had failed to develop
a centralized monarchical state. Papal opposition to the
rule of the Hohenstaufen emperors in the thirteenth
century had virtually guaranteed that. Moreover, southern Italy was divided into the kingdom of Naples, ruled
by the house of Anjou, and Sicily, whose kings came from
the Spanish house of Aragon. The center of the peninsula
remained under the rather shaky control of the papacy.
Lack of centralized authority had enabled numerous citystates in northern and central Italy to remain independent
of any political authority.

In the course of the fourteenth century, two general
tendencies can be discerned in Italy: the replacement of
republican governments by tyrants and the expansion of
the larger city-states at the expense of the less powerful
ones. Nearly all the cities of northern Italy began their
existence as free communes with republican governments.
But in the fourteenth century, intense internal strife led
city-states to resort to temporary expedients, allowing rule
by one man with dictatorial powers. Limited rule, however,
soon became long-term despotism,
as tyrants proved willing to use
force to maintain power. Eventually, such tyrants tried to legitimize
their power by purchasing titles
from the emperor (still nominally
ruler of northern Italy as Holy
Roman Emperor). In this fashion,
the Visconti became the dukes of
Milan and the d’Este the dukes of
Ferrara.

The other change of great significance was the development of
regional entities as the larger states
expanded at the expense of the
smaller ones. By the beginning of
the fifteenth century, three major
states came to dominate northern
Italy. In the fertile Po valley, where
the chief trade routes from Italian
coastal cities to the Alpine passes
crossed, Milan was one of the
richest city-states in Italy. Politically,
it was also one of the most agitated until members of the
Visconti family established themselves as hereditary dukes
of Milan and extended their power over all of Lombardy.
The republic of Florence dominated the region of Tuscany. In the course of the fourteenth century, a small but
wealthy merchant oligarchy established control of the
Florentine government, led the Florentines in a series of
successful wars against their neighbors, and established
Florence as a major territorial state in northern Italy. The
other major northern Italian state was the maritime republic of Venice, which had grown rich from commercial
activity in the eastern Mediterranean and northern Europe. Venice remained a stable political entity governed
by a small oligarchy of merchant-aristocrats who had
become extremely wealthy through their trading activities. Venice’s commercial empire brought in enormous
revenues and gave it the status of an international power.
At the end of the fourteenth century, Venice embarked on
the conquest of a territorial state in northern Italy to
protect its food supply and its overland trade routes.

The Decline of the Church

Q Focus Question: How and why did the authority and
prestige of the papacy decline in the fourteenth
century?

The papacy of the Roman Catholic Church reached the
height of its power in the thirteenth century. Theories of
papal supremacy included a doctrine of ‘‘fullness of power’’ as the
spiritual head of Christendom and
claims to universal temporal authority over all secular rulers. But
the growing secular monarchies of
Europe presented a challenge to
papal claims of temporal supremacy that led the papacy into a
conflict with these territorial states
that it was unable to win. Papal
defeat in turn led to other crises
that brought into question and
undermined not only the pope’s
temporal authority over all Christendom but his spiritual authority
as well.

Boniface VIII and the
Conflict with the State

The struggle between the papacy
and the secular monarchies began during the pontificate
of Pope Boniface VIII (1294--1303). One major issue
appeared to be at stake between the pope and King Philip
IV (1285--1314) of France. Looking for a source of new
revenues, Philip expressed the right to tax the French
clergy. Boniface VIII claimed that the clergy of any state
could not pay taxes to their secular ruler without the
pope’s consent. Underlying this issue, however, was a
basic conflict between the claims of the papacy to universal authority over both church and state, which necessitated complete control over the clergy, and the
claims of the king that all subjects, including the clergy,
were under the jurisdiction of the crown and subject to
the king’s authority on matters of taxation and justice. In
short, the fundamental issue was the universal sovereignty of the papacy versus the royal sovereignty of the
monarch.

Boniface VIII asserted his position in a series of
papal bulls or letters, the most important of which was
Unam Sanctam, issued in 1302. It was the strongest
statement ever made by a pope on the supremacy of the
spiritual authority over the temporal authority (see the
box on p. 233). When it became apparent that the pope
had decided to act on his principles by excommunicating Philip IV of France, the latter sent a
small contingent of French forces to capture Boniface
and bring him back to France for trial. The pope was
captured in Anagni, although Italian nobles from the
surrounding countryside rescued him. The shock of this
experience, however, soon led to the pope’s death.
Philip’s strong-arm tactics had
produced a clear victory for the
national monarchy over the papacy,
since no later pope dared renew the
extravagant claims of Boniface VIII.
To ensure his position and avoid
any future papal threat, Philip IV
brought enough pressure on the
college of cardinals to achieve the
election of a Frenchman, Clement
V (1305--1314), as pope. Using the
excuse of turbulence in the city of
Rome, the new pope took up residence in Avignon, on the east bank
of the Rhoˆne River. Although
Avignon was located in the Holy
Roman Empire and was not a
French possession, it lay just across
the river from the possessions of
King Philip IV and was French in
culture.

The Papacy at Avignon (1305--1378)

The residency of the popes in Avignon for most of the
fourteenth century led to a decline in papal prestige and
growing antipapal sentiment. The city of Rome was the
traditional capital of the universal church. The pope
was the bishop of Rome, and his position was based on
being the successor to the apostle Peter, the first bishop
of Rome. It was unseemly that the head of the Catholic
church should reside outside of Rome. In the 1330s, the
popes began to construct a stately palace in Avignon, a
clear indication that they intended to stay for some
time.

Other factors also led to a decline in papal prestige
during the Avignonese residency. Many contemporaries
believed that the popes at Avignon were captives of
the French monarchy. Although questionable, seeing that
Avignon did not belong to the French
monarchy, it was easy
to believe in view of
Avignon’s proximity
to French lands.
Moreover, during the
seventy-three years of
the Avignonese papacy, of the 134 new
cardinals created by the popes, 113 of them were French.
At the same time, the popes attempted to find new
sources of revenue to compensate for their loss of revenue
from the Papal States and began to impose new taxes on
the clergy. Furthermore, the splendor in which the pope
and cardinals were living in Avignon led to a highly vocal
criticism of both clergy and papacy in the fourteenth
century. Avignon had become a powerful symbol of
abuses within the church, and many people began to call
for the pope’s return to Rome. One of the most prominent calls came from Catherine of Siena (c. 1347--1380),
whose saintly demeanor and claims of visions from God
led the city of Florence to send her on a mission to Pope
Gregory XI (1370--1378) in Avignon. She told the pope,
‘‘Because God has given you authority and because you
have accepted it, you ought to use your virtue and power;
if you do not wish to use it, it might be better for you to
resign what you have accepted; it would give more honor
to God and health to your soul.’’6

The Great Schism

Catherine of Siena’s admonition seemed to be heeded in
1377, when at long last Pope Gregory XI, perceiving the
disastrous decline in papal prestige, returned to Rome. He
died soon afterward, however, the following spring. When
the college of cardinals met in conclave to elect a new
pope, the citizens of Rome, fearful that the French majority would choose another Frenchman who would return the papacy to Avignon, threatened that the cardinals
would not leave Rome alive unless a Roman or an Italian
were elected pope. Indeed, the guards of the conclave
warned the cardinals that they ‘‘ran the risk of being torn
in pieces’’ if they did not choose an Italian. The terrified
cardinals duly elected the Italian archbishop of Bari,
who was subsequently crowned as Pope Urban VI (1378--
1389) on Easter Sunday.
			
Following his election, Urban VI made clear his plans
to reform the papal curia and even to swamp the college
of cardinals with enough new Italian cardinals to eliminate the French majority. After many of the cardinals (the
French ones) withdrew from Rome in late summer and
were finally free of the Roman mob, they issued a manifesto, saying that they had been coerced by the mob and
that Urban’s election was therefore null and void. The
dissenting cardinals thereupon chose one of their number, a Frenchman, who took the title of Clement VII and
promptly returned to Avignon. Since Urban remained in
Rome, there were now two popes, initiating what has
been called the Great Schism of the church.

Europe’s loyalties soon became divided: France,
Spain, Scotland, and southern Italy supported Clement,
while England, Germany, Scandinavia, and most of Italy
supported Urban. These divisions generally followed
political lines. Because the French supported the Avignonese, so did their allies; their enemies, particularly
England and its allies, supported the Roman pope.

The Great Schism badly damaged the faith of
Christian believers. The pope was widely believed to be
the leader of Christendom and, as Boniface VIII had
pointed out, held the keys to the kingdom of heaven.
Since both lines of popes denounced the other as the
Antichrist, such a spectacle could not help but undermine
the institution that had become the very foundation of
the church. The Great Schism introduced uncertainty
into the daily lives of ordinary Christians.

The Conciliar Movement

As dissatisfaction with the papacy grew, so did the calls
for a revolutionary approach to solving the church’s
institutional problems. Final authority in spiritual
matters must reside not with the popes, reformers
claimed, but with a general church council representing
all members. The Great Schism led large numbers of
serious churchmen to take up the theory of conciliarism in the belief that only a general council of the
church could end the schism and bring reform to the
church in its ‘‘head and members.’’ In desperation, a
group of cardinals from both lines of popes finally
heeded these theoretical formulations and convened a
general council. This Council of Pisa, which met in
1409, deposed the two rival popes and elected a new
one. The council’s action proved disastrous when the
two deposed popes refused to step down. There were
now three popes, and the church seemed more hopelessly divided than ever.

Leadership in convening a new council now passed to
the Holy Roman Emperor, Sigismund. As a result of his
efforts, a new ecumenical church council met at Constance from 1414 to 1418. It had three major objectives:
to end the schism, to eradicate heresy, and to reform the
church in ‘‘head and members.’’ The ending of the schism
proved to be the Council of Constance’s easiest task.
After the three competing popes either resigned or were
deposed, a new conclave elected a Roman cardinal, a
member of a prominent Roman family, as Pope Martin V
(1417--1431). The council was much less successful in
dealing with the problems of heresy and reform.

Culture and Society in an
Age of Adversity

Q Focus Questions: What were the major developments
in art and literature in the fourteenth century? How
did the adversities of the fourteenth century affect
urban life?

In the midst of disaster, the fourteenth century proved
creative in its own way. The rapid growth of vernacular
literature and new inventions made an impact on European life at the same time that the effects of plague were
felt in many areas of medieval towns and cities.

The Development of Vernacular Literature

Although Latin remained the language of the church
liturgy and the official documents of both church and
state, the fourteenth century witnessed a surge in literature written in vernacular languages, especially in Italy. By
the late fifteenth century, vernacular literary forms had
become so celebrated that they could compete with and
would eventually replace works in Latin.

Dante Alighieri (1265--1321) came from an old
Florentine noble family that had fallen on hard times. His
masterpiece in the Italian vernacular was the Divine
Comedy, written between 1313 and 1321. Cast in a typical
medieval framework, the Divine Comedy is basically the
story of the soul’s progression to salvation, a fundamental
medieval preoccupation. The lengthy poem was divided
into three major sections corresponding to the realms of
the afterworld: hell, purgatory, and heaven or paradise. In
the ‘‘Inferno’’ (see the box on p. 236), Dante is led by his
guide, the classical author Virgil, who is a symbol of
human reason. But Virgil (or reason) can only lead the
poet so far on his journey. At the end of ‘‘Purgatory,’’
Beatrice (the true love of Dante’s life), who represents
revelation---which alone can explain the mysteries of
heaven---becomes his guide into ‘‘Paradise.’’ Here Beatrice
presents Dante to Saint Bernard, a symbol of mystical
contemplation. The saint turns Dante over to the Virgin
Mary, since grace is necessary to achieve the final step of
entering the presence of God, where one beholds ‘‘the love
that moves the sun and the other stars.’’7

Geoffrey Chaucer (c. 1340--1400) brought a new level
of sophistication to the English vernacular language in his
famous work The Canterbury Tales. His beauty of expression and clear, forceful language were important in
transforming his East Midland dialect into the chief ancestor of the modern English language. The Canterbury
Tales is a collection of stories told by a group of twentynine pilgrims journeying from Southwark to the tomb of
Saint Thomas at Canterbury. This format gave Chaucer
the chance to portray an entire range of English society,
from highborn to lowborn. The stories these pilgrims told
to while away the time on the journey were just as varied
as the storytellers themselves: knightly romances, fairy
tales, saints’ lives, sophisticated satires, and crude
anecdotes.

One of the extraordinary vernacular writers of the
age was Christine de Pizan (c. 1364--1430). Thanks to her
father’s position at the court of Charles V of France, she
received a good education. Her husband died when she
was only twenty-five (they had been married for ten
years), leaving her with little income and three small
children and her mother to support. Christine took the
unusual step of becoming a writer to earn her living.
Her poems were soon in demand, and by 1400 she had
achieved financial security.

Christine de Pizan is best known, however, for her
French prose works written in defense of women. In The
Book of the City of Ladies, written in 1404, she denounced
the many male writers who had argued that women by
their very nature were prone to evil, unable to learn, and
easily swayed and consequently needed to be controlled
by men. With the help of Reason, Righteousness, and
Justice, who appear to her in a vision, Christine refutes
these antifeminist attacks. Women, she argues, are not
evil by nature and could learn as well as men if they were
permitted to attend the same schools: ‘‘Should I also tell
you whether a woman’s nature is clever and quick enough
to learn speculative sciences as well as to discover them,
and likewise the manual arts? I assure you that women are
equally well-suited and skilled to carry them out and to
put them to sophisticated use once they have learned
them.’’8 She ends the book by encouraging women to
defend themselves against the attacks of men, who are
incapable of understanding women.

Art and the Black Death

The fourteenth century produced an artistic outburst in
new directions as well as a large body of morbid work
influenced by the Black Death and the recurrence of the
plague. The city of Florence witnessed the first dramatic
break with medieval tradition in the work of Giotto
(1266--1337), often considered a forerunner of Italian
Renaissance painting. Although he worked throughout
Italy, Giotto’s most famous works were done in Padua
and Florence. Coming out of the formal Byzantine
school, Giotto transcended it with a new kind of realism,
a desire to imitate nature that Renaissance artists later
identified as the basic component of Classical art. Giotto’s
figures were solid and rounded; and placed realistically in
relationship to each other and their background, they
provided a sense of three-dimensional depth. The expressive faces and physically realistic bodies gave his sacred figures human qualities with which spectators could
identify.

The Black Death had a visible impact on art. For one
thing, it wiped out entire guilds of artists. At the same
time, survivors, including the newly rich who patronized
artists, were no longer so optimistic as before. Some were
more guilty about enjoying life and more concerned
about gaining salvation. Postplague art began to concentrate on pain and death. A fairly large number of artistic works came to be based on the ars moriendi, the art
of dying.

Changes in Urban Life

One immediate by-product of the Black Death was a
greater regulation of urban activities by town governments. Authorities tried to keep cities cleaner by enacting new ordinances against waste products in the
streets. Viewed as unhealthy places, bathhouses were
closed down, leading to a noticeable decline in personal
cleanliness.

The effects of plague were also felt in other areas of
medieval urban life. The basic unit of the late medieval
urban environment was the nuclear family of husband,
wife, and children. Especially in wealthier families, there
might also be servants, apprentices, and other relatives,
including widowed mothers and the husband’s illegitimate children.

Before the Black Death, late marriages were common
for urban couples. It was not unusual for husbands to be
in their late thirties or forties and wives in their early
twenties. The expense of beginning a household probably
necessitated the delay in marriage. But the situation
changed dramatically after the plague, reflecting new
economic opportunities for the survivors and a reluctance to postpone living in the presence of so much
death. The economic difficulties of the fourteenth century also had a tendency to strengthen the development
of gender roles and to set new limits on employment
opportunities for women. Based on the authority of
Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas and other thirteenth-century
scholastic theologians had advanced the belief that according to the natural order, men were active and
domineering while women were passive and submissive.
As more and more lawyers, doctors, and priests, who had
been trained in universities where these notions were
taught, entered society, these ideas of man’s and woman’s
different natures became widely acceptable. Increasingly,
women were expected to forgo any active functions in
society and remain subject to direction from males. A
fourteenth-century Parisian provost commented on glass
cutters that ‘‘no master’s widow who keeps working at his
craft after her husband’s death may take on apprentices,
for the men of the craft do not believe that a woman can
master it well enough to teach a child to master it, for the
craft is a very delicate one.’’9 Although this statement
suggests that some women were in fact running businesses, it also reveals that they were viewed as incapable
of undertaking all of men’s activities. Based on a pattern
of gender, Europeans created a division of labor roles
between men and women that continued until the Industrial Revolution of the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries.

In practice, however, some women benefited in the
fourteenth century from the effects of the Black Death.
The loss of so many male workers in cities opened up
new jobs for women, including positions as metalworkers and stevedores. In clothmaking, women were
allowed to assume better-paying jobs as weavers. Brewing became an all-female profession by 1450. Widows
also occasionally carried on their husbands’ shops or
businesses.

Inventions and New Patterns

Despite its problems, the fourteenth century witnessed a
continuation of the technological innovations that had
characterized the High Middle Ages. The most extraordinary of these inventions, and one that had a major
impact on European cities, was the clock. The mechanical
clock was invented at the end of the thirteenth century
but not perfected until the fourteenth. The time-telling
clock was actually a by-product of a larger astronomical
clock. The best-designed one was constructed by Giovanni di Dondi in the mid-fourteenth century. Dondi’s
clock contained the signs of the zodiac but also struck on
the hour. Because clocks were expensive, they were usually installed only in the towers of churches or municipal
buildings. The first clock striking equal hours was in a
church in Milan; in 1335, a chronicler described it as ‘‘a
wonderful clock, with a very large clapper which strikes a
bell twenty-four hours of the day and night and thus at
the first hour of the night gives one sound, at the second
two strikes . . . and so distinguishes one hour from another, which is of greatest use to men of every degree.’’10
Clocks introduced a wholly new conception of time
into the lives of Europeans; they revolutionized how
people thought about and used time. Throughout most
of the Middle Ages, time was determined by natural
rhythms (daybreak and nightfall) or church bells that
were rung at more or less regular three-hour intervals,
corresponding to the ecclesiastical offices of the church.
Clocks made it possible to plan one’s day and organize
one’s activities around the regular striking of bells. This
brought a new regularity into the lives of workers
and merchants, defining urban existence and enabling
merchants and bankers to see the value of time in a
new way.

Invented earlier by the Chinese, gunpowder also
made its appearance in the West in the fourteenth century. The use of gunpowder eventually brought drastic
changes to European warfare. Its primary use was in
cannons, although early cannons were prone to blow up,
making them as dangerous to the people firing them as to
the enemy. Even as late as 1460, an attack on a castle using
the ‘‘Lion,’’ an enormous Flemish cannon, proved disastrous for the Scottish king James II when the ‘‘Lion’’ blew
up, killing the king and a number of his retainers. Continued improvement in the construction of cannons,
however, soon made them extremely valuable in reducing
both castles and city walls.

CONCLUSION

European civilization developed many of its fundamental features in
the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries. Territorial states,
parliaments, capitalist trade and industry, banks, cities, and
vernacular literatures were all products of that fertile period. During
the same time, the Catholic church under the direction of the papacy
reached its apogee. European society in the fourteenth century,
however, was challenged by an overwhelming number of crises.
Devastating plague, decline in trade and industry, bank failures,
peasant revolts pitting lower classes against the upper classes,
seemingly constant warfare, aristocratic factional conflict that
undermined political stability, the absence of the popes from Rome,
and even the spectacle of two popes condemning each other as the
Antichrist all seemed to overpower Europeans in this ‘‘calamitous
century.’’ Not surprisingly, much of the art of the period depicted the
Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse described in the New Testament
book of Revelation: Death, Famine, Pestilence, and War. To some
people, no doubt, the last days of the world seemed to be at hand.

The new European society, however, proved remarkably
resilient. Periods of crisis usually give rise to new ideas and new
practices. Intellectuals of the period saw themselves as standing on
the threshold of a new age and a rebirth of the best features of
Classical civilization, an era widely referred to as the Renaissance.
