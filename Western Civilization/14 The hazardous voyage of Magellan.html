<h2 id="orgb3b837f">14 The hazardous voyage of Magellan</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb3b837f">
<p class="verse">
While many Europeans were occupied with the problems of dynastic expansion and religious reform,<br />
&#xa0;others were taking voyages that propelled Europeans far beyond the medieval walls<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;in which they had been enclosed for almost a thousand years.<br />
One of these adventurers was the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan.<br />
Convinced that he could find a sea passage to Asia through America,<br />
&#xa0;Magellan persuaded the king of Spain to finance an exploratory voyage.<br />
On August 10, 1519,<br />
&#xa0;Magellan set sail on the Atlantic with five ships and a Spanish crew of 277 men.<br />
After a stormy and difficult crossing of the ocean,<br />
&#xa0;Magellan’s fleet moved down the coast of South America,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;searching for the strait that would take him through.<br />
His Spanish ship captains thought he was crazy:<br />
&#xa0;'The fool is obsessed with his search for a strait,' one remarked.<br />
'On the flame of his ambition he will crucify us all.'<br />
At last, in October 1520, he found it,<br />
&#xa0;passing through a narrow waterway (later named the Strait of Magellan)<br />
&#xa0;and emerging into an unknown ocean that he called the Pacific Sea.<br />
Magellan reckoned that it would then be a short distance to the Spice Islands of the East,<br />
&#xa0;but he was badly mistaken.<br />
Week after week, he and his crew sailed on across the Pacific as their food supplies dwindled.<br />
According to one account,<br />
&#xa0;'When their last biscuit had gone,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;they scraped the maggots out of the casks, mashed them and served them as gruel.<br />
They made cakes out of sawdust soaked with the urine of rats<br />
&#xa0;&#x2014;the rats themselves, as delicacies, had long since been hunted to extinction.'<br />
At last they reached the Philippines (named after King Philip II of Spain),<br />
&#xa0;where Magellan met his death at the hands of the natives.<br />
Although only one of his original fleet of five ships survived and returned to Spain,<br />
&#xa0;Magellan is still remembered as the first person to circumnavigate the world.<br />
<br />
At the beginning of the sixteenth century,<br />
&#xa0;European adventurers like Magellan<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;had begun launching small fleets into the vast reaches of the Atlantic Ocean.<br />
They were hardly aware that they were launching a new era,<br />
&#xa0;not only for Europe, but for the peoples of Asia, Africa, and the Americas as well.<br />
Nevertheless, the voyages of these Europeans marked the beginning of a process<br />
&#xa0;that led to radical changes in the political, economic, and cultural life of the entire world.<br />
<br />
Between 1500 and 1800, European power engulfed the globe.<br />
In the Americas, Europeans established colonies that spread their laws, religions, and cultures.<br />
In the island regions of Southeast Asia, Europeans firmly implanted their rule.<br />
Elsewhere in Asia and in many parts of Africa,<br />
&#xa0;their trading activities dramatically affected the lifeways of the local peoples.<br />
