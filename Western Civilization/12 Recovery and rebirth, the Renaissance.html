<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org37f55ef">
<p class="verse">
The Renaissance was a period of transition<br />
&#xa0;that extended most of the economic, political, and social trends<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that had begun in the High Middle Ages.<br />
It was also a movement<br />
&#xa0;in which intellectuals and artists proclaimed a new vision of humankind<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and raised fundamental questions about the value and importance of the individual.<br />
Of course, intellectuals and artists wrote and painted for the upper classes,<br />
&#xa0;and the brilliant intellectual, cultural, and artistic accomplishments of the Renaissance<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;were really products of and for the elite.<br />
The ideas of the Renaissance did not have a broad base among the masses of the people.<br />
As Lorenzo the Magnificent, ruler of Florence, once commented,<br />
&#xa0;'Only men of noble birth can obtain perfection.<br />
&#xa0;The poor, who work with their hands and have no time to cultivate their minds,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;are incapable of it.'<br />
<br />
The Renaissance did, however, raise new questions about medieval traditions.<br />
In criticizing current religious practices,<br />
&#xa0;the humanists raised fundamental issues about the Catholic church,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;which was still an influential institution.<br />
As we shall see in the next chapter,<br />
&#xa0;the intellectual revolution of the fifteenth century gave way to a religious renaissance<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that touched the lives of people, including the masses, in new and profound ways.<br />
After the Reformation,<br />
&#xa0;Europe would never again be the unified Christian commonwealth it once believed it was.<br />
