<h2 id="org08c409f">18 The eighteenth century that historians define</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org08c409f">
<p class="verse">
Historians often define the eighteenth century as the years from 1715 to 1789.<br />
Politically, this makes sense,<br />
&#xa0;because 1715 marks the end of the age of Louis XIV<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and 1789 was the year in which the French Revolution erupted.<br />
This period has often been portrayed as the final phase of Europe’s old order,<br />
&#xa0;swept away by the violent upheaval and reordering of society<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;associated with the French Revolution.<br />
Europe’s old order, still largely agrarian,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;dominated by kings and landed aristocrats,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and grounded in privileges for nobles, clergy, towns, and provinces,<br />
&#xa0;seemed to continue a basic pattern that had prevailed in Europe since medieval times.<br />
But new ideas and practices were beginning to emerge.<br />
Just as a new intellectual order based on rationalism and secularism<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;was evolving from the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment,<br />
&#xa0;demographic, economic, and social patterns were beginning to change in ways<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that heralded the emergence of a modern new order.<br />
<br />
The ideas of the Enlightenment seemed to proclaim a new political age as well.<br />
Catherine the Great, who ruled Russia from 1762 to 1796, wrote to Voltaire:<br />
&#xa0;'Since 1746 I have been under the greatest obligations to you.<br />
&#xa0;Before that period I read nothing but romances, but by chance your works fell into my hands,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and ever since then I have never ceased to read them,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;and have no desire for books less well written than yours, or less instructive.'<br />
The empress also invited Diderot to Russia and,<br />
&#xa0;when he arrived, urged him to speak frankly as man to man.<br />
Diderot did, offering her advice for a far-ranging program of political and financial reform.<br />
But Catherine's apparent eagerness to make enlightened reforms was tempered by skepticism.<br />
She said of Diderot,<br />
&#xa0;'If I had believed him, everything would have been turned upside down in my kingdom;<br />
&#xa0;legislation, administration, finance&#x2013;<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;all would have been turned topsy-turvy to make room for impractical theories.'<br />
For Catherine, enlightened reform remained more a dream than a reality,<br />
&#xa0;and in the end, the waging of wars to gain more power was more important.<br />
<br />
In the eighteenth century,<br />
&#xa0;the process of centralization<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;that had characterized the growth of states since the Middle Ages continued<br />
&#xa0;as most European states enlarged their bureaucratic machinery and consolidated their governments<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;in order to collect the revenues and build the armies<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;they needed to compete militarily with the other European states.<br />
International competition continued to be the favorite pastime of eighteenth-century rulers.<br />
Within the European state system,<br />
&#xa0;the nations that would dominate Europe until World War I<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#x2013;Britain, France, Austria, Prussia, and Russia&#x2013;<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;emerged as the five great powers of Europe.<br />
Their rivalries led to major wars.<br />
In the midst of this state building and warmaking,<br />
&#xa0;dramatic demographic, economic, and social changes<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;gave rise to a radical transformation in the way Europeans would raise food and produce goods.<br />
