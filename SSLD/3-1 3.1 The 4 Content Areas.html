<h2 id="org2edef6a">3-1 3.1 The 4 Content Areas</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2edef6a">
<p class="verse">
We will now be talking about receptive skills.<br />
And when reading the book,<br />
&#xa0;I noticed that both reception and expression sort of targeted four main content areas<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and they were both the same.<br />
So, they were facts, attitudes, emotions, and needs for both.<br />
And I'm sort of wondering why this similarity?<br />
<br />
Okay, so first of all, we probably will have to explain<br />
&#xa0;why these four content areas of all the possible content areas are chosen, right.<br />
I would say that this is probably based on our experience, helping people manage emotional issues.<br />
Very often, when people were trying to communicate, they want to establish facts.<br />
But then we understand that facts were never totally objective.<br />
If you go to any household and ask who has done a big share of housework,<br />
&#xa0;you will not have the same answer from everyone.<br />
And if you ask a couple about some simple facts like are we spending enough time together<br />
&#xa0;and you get very different answers.<br />
<br />
Because facts are always colored and conditioned by our emotional needs and our attitudes.<br />
And sometimes we will be sort of constructing reality according to our needs and emotional state.<br />
So the reason why we put all this together is,<br />
&#xa0;we start off with something<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that looks like it is straightforward, objective, neutral and help people appreciate that.<br />
That is not always the case.<br />
And from that onwards, we'll leap onto this idea<br />
&#xa0;that whatever we are communicating,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;we have to be paying attention to the kind of attitudes that people have taken,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;the values that are weaved into the message,<br />
And very often, emotions are important.<br />
And back to the SSLD core concept, SSLD is always focused on needs,<br />
&#xa0;because why do we even want to be communicating with each other?<br />
Because there's something that we need from that interaction,<br />
&#xa0;and there's something that we want to attain or accomplish in that conversation.<br />
So this is why we have got these four content areas chosen.<br />
As mentioned,<br />
&#xa0;the four key content areas that we should pay attention to when we are listening to others are:<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;Facts, which can be subjective, depending on your attitudes and emotions and of course,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;the core concept of the N3C analysis, your needs.<br />
There's often something that we want to accomplish or attain when we engage in conversations,<br />
&#xa0;and that's because we have needs.<br />
