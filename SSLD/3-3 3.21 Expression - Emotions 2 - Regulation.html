<h2 id="org0a28c65">3-3 3.21 Expression - Emotions 2 - Regulation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0a28c65">
<p class="verse">
It sounds like emotional regulation,<br />
&#xa0;not just emotional expression, but the regulation of emotions is really important.<br />
Yes.<br />
I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about that.<br />
Yeah, well, like I just said, when you're expressing emotions, you feel emotional.<br />
And being able to regulate your own emotion is actually a very important human capacity.<br />
<br />
There is a concept in biology, which is also utilized a lot in psychology.<br />
That is the concept of homeostasis, the so-called normal state that we tend to return to.<br />
We have a sort of a normal heart rate or blood pressure.<br />
It can change when you're active, or when you're aroused,<br />
&#xa0;or when you're dealing with some external challenge.<br />
But it'll, body temperature as well but then everything will return to more or less the same level.<br />
So with emotions, we hope the same thing will happen.<br />
So you get excited, you get stimulated, you get aroused,<br />
&#xa0;hopefully, you'll be returning to a relatively calm and stable state.<br />
But if it doesn't happen, it can then become a mental health challenge,<br />
&#xa0;like people who are chronically depressed, for example.<br />
Or people who feel sad, and they might have good reasons for feeling that,<br />
&#xa0;but the problem is that they do not return to a more stable state in which you are not sad.<br />
Or if you're anxious,<br />
&#xa0;which is probably a natural response to external stress or threat or challenge.<br />
But, again, if you’re constantly in that state<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and you do not return to a more relaxed and calm state,<br />
&#xa0;something is wrong with your emotional accumulation.<br />
Problems with emotional regulation<br />
&#xa0;can actually become severe mental health or even physical health issues.<br />
<br />
In an interpersonal relationship, if you're not able to regulate your emotion,<br />
&#xa0;then you have a higher chance of doing things or saying things that you later regret.<br />
So it is obviously a good thing for us to be able to become aware of our emotional experience<br />
&#xa0;and be able to increase our capacity for regulating it.<br />
And I just want to say this, we're not talking about suppressing your emotions,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;we're not talking about denying your emotions,<br />
&#xa0;those are actually not helpful.<br />
Good emotional regulation actually is predicated on,<br />
&#xa0;I know that I'm feeling this,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;I know that I'm angry, I know that I am anxious, or I'm sad or depressed, doesn't matter.<br />
I know that I have those feelings and I accept that I have those feelings.<br />
But I also understand that,<br />
&#xa0;yeah, I know I have those feelings<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;but I have the capacity to return to this, sort of homeostasis state.<br />
Then I feel more comfortable and relaxed<br />
&#xa0;and when I try to express my emotions<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;I know that this is what I need to do now, but I will get to a different state after that.<br />
I think that is an important understanding.<br />
