<h2 id="org7808736">3-2 3.12 Attributions 3 - Needs</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7808736">
<p class="verse">
Is an attribution always a response to an underlying need?<br />
I would say that in most cases, but in some cases, it can all just be a habit.<br />
Okay.<br />
Because making simple attributions, as I said, consumes less energy.<br />
Mm-hm.<br />
To a lot of people, I just do not have that much psychological energy<br />
&#xa0;to put into this and think about this carefully and consider this in multiple dimensions.<br />
It will be just easier for me to say, okay, this is how it works.<br />
<br />
Actually, later on, when we have a chance to look at how research is done,<br />
&#xa0;we will find that even research scientists were making the same mistake.<br />
We try to come up with very simple answers and we ask very simple questions.<br />
One example that I can talk about here, and then later on in this course,<br />
&#xa0;hopefully, we'll have a chance to look into this in more detail.<br />
Is very often people are interested in the idea of who are the people who are attractive?<br />
What makes people attractive?<br />
<br />
When you ask a question like this, you're asking, first of all, a very simple question.<br />
That's an oversimplified question.<br />
And then people come up with simple answers,<br />
&#xa0;if you're tall, you're blonde, that you're handsome or you're white or you're young or whatever.<br />
You're more attractive than people who're not blonde, who are darker skinned,<br />
&#xa0;or if you're older or whatever.<br />
So that is a simple attribution,<br />
&#xa0;you try to explain interpersonal attraction by referring to a very simple factor or variable.<br />
<br />
The one question that we do not ask is you are attractive to whom?<br />
[LAUGH]<br />
[LAUGH]<br />
What you find attractive may be very different from that what I find attractive.<br />
So the reference group is again, overly simplified and homogenized or standardized.<br />
When we start asking more nuanced, more complex set of questions,<br />
&#xa0;we obviously will have to spend more time finding the answers.<br />
This is why a lot of people are just like okay, it's simple.<br />
If you're taller, you're more attractive.<br />
If you're blonde, you're more attractive.<br />
That makes life simpler but this is actually an attribution error.<br />
Seeking answers in this way, in my opinion, is not even the best way to do research.<br />
Yeah.<br />
