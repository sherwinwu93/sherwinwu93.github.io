<h2 id="orga7f69db">4-3 4.13 Fear of Intimacy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga7f69db">
<p class="verse">
Some people talk a lot about this sort of fear of intimacy that is inherent in some relationships.<br />
And I'm wondering if you can explain what that's all about.<br />
Well, you know, fear is very easily triggered when you get close to someone.<br />
The reason is actually pretty simple<br />
&#xa0;because when you get intimate, or when you get close to someone, you're more exposed.<br />
<br />
You're showing more of yourself,<br />
&#xa0;and to be very honest, most people, majority of people,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;are not 100% wholly comfortable with who they are.<br />
We all have, like you know, unpleasant history,<br />
&#xa0;we all have our sort of like dark side, things that we ourselves do not even accept.<br />
That can be like trauma, or they are like things that we have done before that we are not proud of.<br />
So, when we are getting close, and these are going to be disclosed.<br />
Some people will feel very anxious.<br />
Like would this person accept this part of me?<br />
<br />
So, you can see that even couples who have been together for a long time,<br />
&#xa0;they're still keeping certain things secret.<br />
They're not telling each other.<br />
It can be like something that is really silly like,<br />
&#xa0;you know, some insensitive thing that you did as a child, as a teenager<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that you just did not feel proud of,<br />
&#xa0;but you do not want your partner to know, right?<br />
But then, when you get closer and closer,<br />
&#xa0;it becomes increasing difficult for you to sort of like not share that,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;because you also want to be understood and taken as who you really are.<br />
So I think as people get closer, right,<br />
&#xa0;this fear can be triggered because of these like sense of being exposed, and feeling vulnerable.<br />
<br />
This is what psychologists have been talking about,<br />
&#xa0;like I don't know all who, like 70 or 80 years now, about this Approach-Avoidance Conflict.<br />
On the one hand, we want to get close while we are approaching,<br />
&#xa0;but as we get up to a certain point, the discomfort increases and we want to avoid.<br />
So there is tendency to either stop or withdraw.<br />
Fortunately some people would be able to get at the balance point, where it's just comfortable,<br />
&#xa0;but some people can actually be experiencing this tension all the time,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;you know, like wanting to get closer, but also wanting to protect oneself and stay away.<br />
It can be pretty tormenting for people to be caught in a situation like this.<br />
And it is also not uncommon for people to feel such discomfort<br />
&#xa0;that you just quit and say okay, like, I'm out of here, it's too much.<br />
<br />
So this fear of intimacy, I think it's pretty easily understandable<br />
&#xa0;and well, I just want to say<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that if you're afraid of getting closer, it doesn't mean that you're sick.<br />
It doesn't mean that you have a huge problem.<br />
I just want to say that maybe it's just the human thing, like many people actually have that.<br />
