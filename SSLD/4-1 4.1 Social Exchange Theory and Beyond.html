<h2 id="org31590a5">4-1 4.1 Social Exchange Theory and Beyond</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org31590a5">
<p class="verse">
So a really predominant theory for understanding relationships, actually since the 1950s,<br />
&#xa0;has been George Homans' Social Exchange Theory.<br />
So basically this theory posits that human beings are rational creatures.<br />
We're only in relationships if the pros outweigh the cons.<br />
Essentially we do a cost benefit analysis and decide to ourselves.<br />
Does this relationship satisfy my needs?<br />
And I'm getting enough out of it?<br />
Or if I'm not getting enough out of it, then I'm leaving the relationship.<br />
So, Professor Tsang, does that theory really comprehensively explain relationships?<br />
<br />
Well, first of all, I have to say that like we probably still do not have a theory<br />
&#xa0;that comprehensively explains relationships.<br />
[LAUGH] Maybe not even SSLD.<br />
We're all trying to get different aspects of relationships better understood.<br />
But getting back to social exchange theory, I think you're right,<br />
&#xa0;like there are formulas that are using to help us understand what is happening.<br />
And you're right in pointing out that you're making the assumption<br />
&#xa0;that human beings are behaving rationally in a very logical, calculating manner.<br />
<br />
I just want to point out there are actually two formulas that are relevant here.<br />
The first one, obviously is weighing the cost benefit,<br />
&#xa0;like putting in so much and not getting enough.<br />
But very often when people get into relationship,<br />
&#xa0;they will also taking another angle to look at the so-called exchange.<br />
It's like how much have you put in and how much have I put in?<br />
Maybe I have put in not a lot and getting a lot out of that.<br />
But if I am sitting there looking at you and find that you are not putting in as much,<br />
&#xa0;the person may still feel dissatisfied because they're saying, oh that's not fair.<br />
So there are actually two sets of calculations that are supposedly going on.<br />
<br />
But as you have already pointed out, that has to assume that human beings are really rational.<br />
And I think we have all the reasons to believe that human beings actually aren't that rational.<br />
Interestingly, in year 2000, a Nobel Prize in economics was awarded to a psychologist or someone<br />
&#xa0;who did the experimental social psychology research.<br />
Daniel Kahneman put forward the Prospect Theory and that won him the Nobel Prize back in 2002.<br />
So what he actually is trying to point out,<br />
&#xa0;it's that like human beings actually rarely behave totally rationally.<br />
And he has decades of experimental findings to back up this claim.<br />
So this is also the same assumption made by a communist for a long time.<br />
That people they do things to maximize utility<br />
&#xa0;so they do those cost benefit analysis<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and make sure that I'm gaining the maximum possible out of any deal.<br />
<br />
But I think we now have a fair bit of evidence to show that like people do not really do that.<br />
So instead of looking at exchange,<br />
&#xa0;we may want to be understanding why people continue doing what they're doing.<br />
And then when we are in social services,<br />
&#xa0;for example, we find a lot of people sticking around in abusive relationships.<br />
Relationships that actually undermines their sense of self-worth.<br />
Relationships that are outright damaging, destructive,<br />
&#xa0;and people seem to stick around for a long time, right?<br />
So we really need to understand relationships<br />
&#xa0;beyond just looking at this like simple, rational exchange formula.<br />
And we have to be careful when we say that as well,<br />
&#xa0;because we do not want to give people this simple black, white, either, or.<br />
I'm not saying that the social exchange dimension is totally irrelevant.<br />
I'm saying that it may explain a certain percentage of variance.<br />
Some aspects of the relationship might be explainable with like social exchange formulation<br />
&#xa0;but relationships are obviously more complicated than that.<br />
