<h2 id="org35a6a2d">4-3 4.15 Building Intimacy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org35a6a2d">
<p class="verse">
Okay, so far what we know with intimacy<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;is everyone's idea of intimacy and standards for what they're looking for is subjective.<br />
And some people might not want intimacy at all, and that's okay, too.<br />
But for people who are looking to maybe foster and grow intimacy in the relationship,<br />
&#xa0;do we have some helpful tips for them?<br />
Well, I think the simple answer is yes, but I have to say this first.<br />
We already said it.<br />
We do not think that everyone has to be aiming at the same level of intimacy,<br />
&#xa0;and they should probably choose the level of intimacy that they're comfortable with.<br />
<br />
But if you really want to do it right,<br />
&#xa0;then you have to understand that the idea of intimacy itself can have its own problems.<br />
The idea of intimacy originally refers to the inmost, innermost, the deepest.<br />
So we are sort of like reaching into the deepest corners of our being, or the ground of being,<br />
&#xa0;and then when two individuals are becoming very intimate,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;like the distance between them, or the boundary even between them will disappear,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and they sort of like merge, right?<br />
And is it desirable?<br />
<br />
It depends on how you look at it.<br />
Like some people think that it is too enmeshed,<br />
&#xa0;then people lose their individuality, which is not necessarily a good thing.<br />
So there is like some kind of balance that we need to achieve.<br />
A psychologist who wrote a very well-known book back in the 50s, Erich Fromm, had this to say.<br />
He said, in love, the paradox occurs that the two beings become one and yet remain two.<br />
So he's sort of like pointing out<br />
&#xa0;there should be a balance between like merging together and becoming one person,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and then maintaining your own individuality, your own being, or your own personality.<br />
So I think that is a key starting point.<br />
<br />
So as we want to do that, right, one of the things that I always encourage<br />
&#xa0;is for people to have a safe space created between them<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;so that they will feel free to negotiate what kind of distance we want to maintain.<br />
And I can ask a participant in this relationship<br />
&#xa0;openly, directly, honestly communicate to you, what am I comfortable with and what do I want.<br />
And when we have that safe space created,<br />
&#xa0;right, then it increases the chance of<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;us negotiating the optimum distance or intimacy that we have.<br />
<br />
But that's a condition for that to happen, right?<br />
And that condition itself can be considered a measure of intimacy itself,<br />
&#xa0;that is condition of trust.<br />
So I need to feel safe, I need to be able to trust you.<br />
And for people to achieve trust,<br />
&#xa0;it also involves some level of understanding, sharing, communication.<br />
And it is actually quite interesting<br />
&#xa0;when I'm talking like this, it may come over as convoluted, but that actually is a cycle.<br />
So if you have more trust, you build a space,<br />
&#xa0;and a space will allow you negotiate your intimacy more easily,<br />
&#xa0;but how do you start having trust in the first place, right?<br />
It will involve the participants to move in and share something.<br />
<br />
And one of the findings that we have paid attention to in social psychology<br />
&#xa0;is how trust can be connected to self-disclosure.<br />
If you would let the other person know more about you,<br />
&#xa0;you are more likely to get the other person to trust you.<br />
But then, like, as you can easily see,<br />
&#xa0;the very process of doing it itself increases intimacy, right?<br />
So in a way, when I say that you have to create a condition of trust,<br />
&#xa0;I'm already suggesting that you become a little bit more intimate, right.<br />
Before you even move on to negotiate, like what is intimate.<br />

4-3 4.15 建立亲密关系<br />
</p>

<p>
好，迄今为止，我们对亲密关系的理解是，每个人对亲密的定义和他们在关系中追求的标准都是主观的。有些人可能根本不想要亲密关系，这也没问题。但对于那些想要在关系中培养和发展亲密的人，我们有没有一些有帮助的建议呢？<br />
</p>

<p>
嗯，我想简单的答案是有的，但我得先说清楚。我们之前已经说过了，我们不认为每个人都必须追求相同层次的亲密关系，他们应该选择一个让自己感到舒适的亲密层次。<br />
</p>

<p>
但如果你真的想做到最好，那么你必须理解亲密本身的概念可能会带来一些问题。亲密的概念最初指的是最内心、最深处的部分。所以我们就像是要触及到自己存在的最深处或最根本的地方，当两个人变得非常亲密时，他们之间的距离，甚至是界限，会消失，他们就像是融合在一起了，对吧？这种融合是值得追求的吗？<br />
</p>

<p>
这取决于你怎么看。有些人认为这太过于纠缠，最终导致人们失去自己的个性，这未必是好事。因此，我们需要在其中找到一种平衡。20世纪50年代写了本非常著名书籍的心理学家埃里希·弗洛姆曾这样说过，他说，在爱情中，出现了一个悖论，那就是两个人成为一体，但又依然保持着各自的独立性。所以，他指出，应该在融合成为一个整体与保持自我个性、自我存在或自我性格之间找到平衡。我认为这是一个关键的起点。<br />
</p>

<p>
所以，如果我们想做到这一点，我总是鼓励大家在彼此之间创造一个安全空间，这样他们就能自由地商量我们希望保持多远的距离。我可以直接、诚实地向这段关系中的另一方表达，我感到舒适的是什么，我想要的是什么。当我们创造了这样的安全空间时，就会增加我们协商出最适合的距离或亲密度的机会。<br />
</p>

<p>
但这是发生这一切的前提，对吧？而这个前提本身可以看作是亲密的一个衡量标准，那就是信任的条件。所以，我需要感到安全，我需要能够信任你。而要建立信任，涉及到某种程度的理解、分享和沟通。实际上，这非常有趣，当我这样说的时候，可能听起来有些复杂，但这实际上是一个循环。如果你有更多的信任，你就能建立一个空间，而这个空间能让你更容易地协商你们的亲密度。但你如何开始建立信任呢？这会要求参与者走得更近，去分享一些东西。<br />
</p>

<p>
在社会心理学中，我们关注到的一个发现是，信任如何与自我揭露相关联。如果你让对方更多地了解你，你更有可能让对方信任你。但正如你很容易看见的那样，进行这一过程本身就会增加亲密关系。所以从某种意义上讲，当我说你必须创造信任的条件时，我已经在暗示你变得更加亲密了，在你甚至开始商量“亲密”是什么之前。<br />
