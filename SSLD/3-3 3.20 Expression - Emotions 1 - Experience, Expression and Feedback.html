<h2 id="orgfed7617">3-3 3.20 Expression - Emotions 1 - Experience, Expression and Feedback</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgfed7617">
<p class="verse">
We've talked about expressing factual information<br />
&#xa0;and also expressing ideas and how to do it effectively.<br />
Now coming up next is emotions,<br />
&#xa0;and I somehow feel that emotions aren't as easy to express effectively.<br />
Yeah, because when we are doing course like this,<br />
&#xa0;we're making an assumption that we ourselves will challenge.<br />
That is, we're making this assumption that's obviously not valid.<br />
We assume that people will behave rationally.<br />
And if you take a course like this on relationship,<br />
&#xa0;then you'll be following the principles, and the rules, and doing it in your real life.<br />
I would say most people probably won't be able to do that.<br />
When we are in the situation when we have to express or communicate emotions,<br />
&#xa0;well, the first things is that we become emotional.<br />
When we become emotional,<br />
&#xa0;it almost doesn't really make sense for us to say<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that you should do this or you shouldn't do that.<br />
So for us to really be in the position<br />
&#xa0;where we can feel better about ourselves, and be able to be who we are emotionally,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and then express ourselves emotionally.<br />
I wouldn't say that even in an appropriate way,<br />
&#xa0;but in a way that we feel comfortable with, a way that we like,<br />
we have to recognize, the expression of emotion itself,<br />
&#xa0;it's not always and cannot be always rational [LAUGH].<br />
Mm-hm.<br />
That is the basic principle.<br />
<br />
When we do that, the most important thing is,<br />
&#xa0;when we're expressing emotions, unlike expressing ideas or facts,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;we are not only trying to communicate something to the other person,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;we are also dealing with our internal state.<br />
Usually when we express emotions,<br />
&#xa0;the very act of expressing emotion, itself, will change the emotion that we expressing.<br />
Say for example, I'm expressing anger to you.<br />
I have the opportunity to let all this anger out,<br />
&#xa0;and I find that you're not reacting with anger and aggression,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;but you're more accommodating and understanding.<br />
Then I'll feel less angry, right?<br />
But if I'm expressing jealousy<br />
&#xa0;and then you are telling me more things [LAUGH] about how wonderful your life is and all that.<br />
[LAUGH] That will make me more jealous [LAUGH], right?<br />
So the expression and feedback that we’ve got<br />
&#xa0;will immediately feed into the emotional experience that we have.<br />
<br />
I think there are a couple of key concepts that we have in SSLD.<br />
One of course, is a simple mechanism of emotional regulation<br />
&#xa0;which deals with the current emotion that we're experiencing.<br />
And the other one we will call it emotional work,<br />
&#xa0;which is a more elaborate process<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;in which we try to get understanding of our own emotional experience<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;and deal with some of this difficult emotions that might even have a long history.<br />
It can be childhood trauma.<br />
It can be some unfinished emotional business or emotional baggages<br />
&#xa0;that we have been carrying in our life for a long period of time.<br />
