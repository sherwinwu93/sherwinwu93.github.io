<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc61cdb7">
<p class="verse">
All right, so I'm really glad that you kind of drove home the point<br />
&#xa0;that everyone has their own subjective ideals.<br />
And I guess with that said, I'm kind of curious to know what are your relationship ideals?<br />
Well yeah, I have to really say this.<br />
Only until very recently that I have become aware<br />
&#xa0;that the ideal that I subscribe to is not actually very popularly shared.<br />
So like in this course we have talking about, you know, social scripts,<br />
&#xa0;and you know like how people are like heavily influenced by what they learn.<br />
And the kind of ideals that the society reinforces.<br />
<br />
So my personal take, I think it can be summarized in a few keywords.<br />
The first important idea that I have is Being.<br />
And to me an ideal relationship, when you're really close with someone.<br />
The most important thing is for you<br />
&#xa0;to be able to be who you really are and to be accepted as who you are and what you stand for.<br />
I think that is the ideal relationship.<br />
Because an ideal relationship is one in which both parties can become fully who they really are.<br />
So I think that is the first thing.<br />
<br />
The other point, which is sort of like sometimes creates a tension with what I just said, right?<br />
Because who and what you are, it can change, because we grow.<br />
But then, not everyone wants to grow.<br />
Some people are actually afraid of growing, because growth involves change.<br />
And it also involves in many cases taking risk, moving into uncertainty.<br />
It can also mean danger, or like you're moving into the unfamiliar.<br />
But to me a good relationship should be growth-enhancing.<br />
There are like theologians and you know, counselors, psychotherapists and theorists,<br />
&#xa0;specifically I'm talking about people like Carl Rogers.<br />
Who believe that if a relationship is not growth-enhancing,<br />
&#xa0;it probably isn't even a relationship that's worth having.<br />
And you probably should think of like quitting and be somewhere else.<br />
That's kind of extreme but I tend to agree with him.<br />
Like I think a good relationship should be growth-enhancing.<br />
So that is the other keyword.<br />
<br />
For that to happen, of course, the relationship has to develop sort of like a life of its own.<br />
So that it has the power, the capacity,<br />
&#xa0;to actually support or enhance the participants to grow in it.<br />
And I would say, I already mentioned about acceptance.<br />
And the other key thing is that although people do change, a certain level of trust is important.<br />
So that you feel that like this is a safe space for me to be who I am<br />
&#xa0;and I can like express certain aspects of myself.<br />
Without worrying about being judged, being rejected, being punished for being who I am.<br />
So I think that is another key idea.<br />
And, of course, when you bring all this back together in the SSLD model,<br />
&#xa0;we will always say<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that for this to really happen, you obviously need to have a very good communication.<br />
Because you know, how you're going to express yourself.<br />
Is your expression of self-being accurately understood or received?<br />
So those are the things that we cover in this course.<br />
