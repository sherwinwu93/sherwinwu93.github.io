<h2 id="orgb4b8cd2">4-3 4.10 Intimacy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb4b8cd2">
<p class="verse">
We've talked a couple of times or it's sort of come up as this notion of what's ideal in SSLD<br />
&#xa0;but really if there's anything we've learned so far,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;everyone has their own definition of what's ideal, right?<br />
So, and for me for example<br />
&#xa0;I think a lot about the notion of intimacy and challenges in relationships.<br />
So some people might just kind of want, like easy-going relationship<br />
&#xa0;in terms of, you know, what they get up to, maybe watching TV, Netflix and chill.<br />
Whereas I don't know,<br />
&#xa0;I personally kind of like the challenge of maybe we don't see eye to eye politically.<br />
And having that ability to really talk it out and debate.<br />
And even sometimes maybe get a little mad.<br />
But for me I sort of need that.<br />
So, I mean people have different standards in what is ideal for them, right?<br />
<br />
That's very true.<br />
You know, that is exactly why we always emphasis individual differences<br />
&#xa0;instead of saying that everyone has to get to this level of intimacy.<br />
Everyone has to attain this level of intensity<br />
&#xa0;and everyone needs<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;to experience this phenomenal self-understanding and growth and development in a relationship.<br />
So I think those are sort of like ideals<br />
&#xa0;that different people, authors, scholars have tried to portray.<br />
<br />
But you're right, in a real life situation, people actually have different preferences.<br />
Some people do not want to have intimacy.<br />
Some people dread intimacy.<br />
Or at least the kind of intimacy that we're talking about.<br />
So it is important, therefore, to start with every individual's N3Cs as we have always said, right?<br />
And if someone wants a pretty instrumental almost relationship<br />
&#xa0;like I just want to have someone to share the house, share the expenses,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;and like provide some basic support to each other in life,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;then we don't talk about detailed stuff at all.<br />
I don't even have to know about your childhood experience and your family of origin, you know?<br />
We're fine.<br />
I don't see why this is a problem.<br />
If both partners are satisfied with that arrangement.<br />
So and I think it's perfectly okay for them to be building a relationship like that.<br />
And if it works out and they are both happy, then I think it is fantastic.<br />
<br />
So what we are trying to say here with regard to, you know,<br />
&#xa0;intimacy, obviously represents a certain set of values that maybe I have.<br />
[LAUGH] Thinking that people can move on and develop a certain kind of intimacy and deep sharing,<br />
&#xa0;and understanding each other, doing creative fun things, and all of those.<br />
And I think it is good that you have asked that question.<br />
So that we can make it clear to people not everyone has to have this kind of relationship.<br />
Okay.<br />
Like you just basically go into a relationship and get what you want out of it.<br />
Make the best of it, according to your own definition, right, your own standard.<br />
I think yeah, that's a very important point.<br />

It is ideals portrayed by many people that represent a certain set of values.<br />
Because people have different preferences about intimacy,<br />
	some don't want to have intimacy, or even dread it.<br />
If both partners are satisfied with the arrangement,<br />
	it is not a problem that they don't have intimacy in the relationship.<br />
So you can go into a relationship and get what you need out of it according to your definition.<br />
