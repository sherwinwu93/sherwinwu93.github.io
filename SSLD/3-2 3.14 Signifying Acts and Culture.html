<h2 id="org5a9fb2e">3-2 3.14 Signifying Acts and Culture</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5a9fb2e">
<p class="verse">
You've talked about 'Signifying Acts',<br />
&#xa0;like bringing someone flowers or slamming a door<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and how they can actually represent underlying emotions.<br />
I'm wondering if there are differences between cultures<br />
&#xa0;in the types of 'Signifying Acts' that they have.<br />
Yes, certainly.<br />
Say for example, bringing flowers is an expression of affection or friendship here in North America.<br />
In most situations,<br />
&#xa0;we have actually elaborate rules regarding when to bring flowers home and what does it mean?<br />
It can be bringing flowers to someone who's in the hospital.<br />
It can be bringing flowers on Valentine's Day.<br />
Those are generally well understood within this culture.<br />
<br />
In some other cultures,<br />
&#xa0;expressions of affection is never done through bringing flowers<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and may be done through doing someone a favour or bringing food.<br />
Slamming doors might be an effective expression of dissatisfaction or anger.<br />
But you easily can imagine, in many parts of the world,<br />
&#xa0;doors are not really a common physical reality, so there's no door for you to slam.<br />
There are like obviously cultural differences with all this.<br />
<br />
Different cultures also have very strong rules on certain things.<br />
Here in North America, we do not pay as much attention to.<br />
One thing that I can think of is gender difference.<br />
Here, say for example, hugging is a way to express like friendship, a connection,<br />
&#xa0;but if you go into a gender segregated culture, that is like taboo.<br />
I remember I was actually taken off a car on the subway in Dubai to another car<br />
&#xa0;because that car was reserved for women and children and I went on that by mistake.<br />
Because I was a visitor, so I was treated politely.<br />
I imagine if you were a local person and people expect you to understand and respect that rule,<br />
&#xa0;I think the reaction would be slightly different.<br />
[LAUGH]<br />
When we move from one culture to another,<br />
&#xa0;we have to be very careful and pay attention to these cultural differences.<br />
