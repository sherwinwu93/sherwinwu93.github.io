<h2 id="org7de3c4a">4-1 4.4 The Issue of Power</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7de3c4a">
<p class="verse">
So we have a really good overview of more theoretical points.<br />
But if we're really applying these to practical example on a relationship,<br />
&#xa0;important concept that comes up for me is that element of power in relationships,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and how that really can dominate how people interact within a relationship.<br />
And I was wondering if you could just tell me more about how this would fit into your framework.<br />
<br />
Yeah, like when we are doing this within academia,<br />
&#xa0;it is obviously not possible to even talk about relationships<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;without talking about power.<br />
You know, feminist scholars have always drawn our attention to<br />
&#xa0;how important it is in conditioning almost anything.<br />
And like from the queer community<br />
&#xa0;like they question the understanding of power within the heteronormal framework.<br />
<br />
So, we do not use that much jargon or conceptual, technical ideas,<br />
&#xa0;and just get really down to earth, right?<br />
We understand that like power is associated with certain social positions and conditions.<br />
Like say for example, if you're a man, you may have more power generally than a woman.<br />
And then, if you're white, you may have generally more power than a person of colour.<br />
And then, if you are straight, and you may have more privilege than someone who is not, and so on.<br />
And then, you can talk about like age, right?<br />
If you are younger, maybe it's a little bit better.<br />
It depends on how young though, right?<br />
Like if you're 14, then you may not have a lot of advantage.<br />
But if you're 34, maybe.<br />
But if you were 84, you would have lost some of that power.<br />
And then, we talk about income level and social status and social capital and all that.<br />
So, but then when you put all these together, right, in a relationship,<br />
&#xa0;all these are put together, right?<br />
So, you're there, you're not just representing a skin colour, a gender,<br />
&#xa0;or a sexual orientation, an income level, or, you know.<br />
<br />
So, people will be like performing themselves within this really complex set of forces.<br />
And it is not unusual for us to see,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;in our work I guess especially couple counselling,<br />
&#xa0;to see someone who, on paper,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;might be occupying privilege, powerful positions,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;but feeling relatively helpless and frustrated in a relationship.<br />
And someone who might not have a lot of power on paper<br />
&#xa0;can actually be playing sort of more dominant role.<br />
Yeah, you can say that statistically that is not as likely, but it does happen, right?<br />
<br />
So, and when we're dealing relationships,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;obviously with all these general observations about power,<br />
&#xa0;we have to be very conscious of them.<br />
But then, when we look at two individuals interacting,<br />
&#xa0;we would be paying more attention to what I generally call<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;like personalized, or individual, strategies of being, strategies of identification or identity.<br />
And when power is involved, there are also strategies of resistance.<br />
So you may find, say for example,<br />
&#xa0;a woman who is from a middle class background, well-educated,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;in a relationship with person of colour, man who is low income, not well educated<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;but still feel like limited, oppressed, or even abused in that relationship.<br />
And then to us, we will have to figure out how did that happen, you know.<br />
And so, this is like a very different take on power.<br />
We always look at very personalized individual circumstances<br />
&#xa0;being mindful, of course, of the social, political reality<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;associated with some of these markers of power, so to speak.<br />
