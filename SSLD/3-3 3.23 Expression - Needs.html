<h2 id="orgd1298f6">3-3 3.23 Expression - Needs</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd1298f6">
<p class="verse">
You've written in the book<br />
&#xa0;that expressing needs is so incredibly important<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;because that's someone's way to get their needs met is by expressing them.<br />
Mm-hm.<br />
So what are some successful ways to express needs?<br />
<br />
Well before we talk about successful ways or better ways to express needs,<br />
&#xa0;maybe we want to first think about why is it difficult to express needs?<br />
Like emotions, right?<br />
When you are emotional,<br />
&#xa0;it's difficult for you to figure out how am I going to express my emotions appropriately?<br />
<br />
And understanding yourself is a condition for effective or appropriate expression.<br />
With needs, there is this similar process here because when you have needs, then you're needy.<br />
When you have needs that are not met<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and you're trying to get the other person to help you address your needs,<br />
&#xa0;very often it will make people feel inadequate.<br />
Some people may feel vulnerable and that's why not everyone is comfortable expressing their needs.<br />
And then the other thing is because when we're in the relationship,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;especially when you're in the relationship with a certain history<br />
&#xa0;and there are negative experiences in the past.<br />
A lot of people do not want to express their needs<br />
&#xa0;because they're afraid of being disappointed, or frustrated.<br />
In some extreme cases, some people were very afraid of expressing their needs<br />
&#xa0;because the expression of needs may lead to punishment, or aggression, or abuse.<br />
So, some people will find it really difficult.<br />
And they would rather hide their needs or conceal them,<br />
&#xa0;or express them in some other ways that are not explicit, that are not direct.<br />
That is like the condition a lot of people may find themselves in.<br />
<br />
Once you get to understand your needs, and you know you have to express them,<br />
&#xa0;then you will be able to learn a thing or two from the SSLD system.<br />
The first thing of course,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;we have been repeating this many, many times, maybe too many times already in this course,<br />
&#xa0;is that you have to first distinguish between<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;what is the thing that you want and what is the thing that you need.<br />
Because what you want may not be what you need.<br />
If you already know what you need,<br />
&#xa0;then you understand that there are usually multiple ways for that need to be addressed.<br />
<br />
When you're expressing that need to someone,<br />
&#xa0;you want to express that in a way that the other person can understand.<br />
Sometimes you want to express it in such a way that the other person can reasonably respond to.<br />
Say for example, you're traveling and you're in a strange country,<br />
&#xa0;and then you are feeling sort of lost and also insecure.<br />
And what you need would be a sense of safety and protection.<br />
But you do not go around telling people,<br />
&#xa0;I'm really scared in this place, I'm feeling very insecure, and I want to feel protected.<br />
Maybe you don't want to do that, right?<br />
So what you might want to do is that you'll be looking for the next person,<br />
&#xa0;who might seem like a good company, who would not create more difficulty or challenge for you.<br />
And then you would just go up to this person and start negotiating an initial relationship.<br />
What you are actually looking for may be a sense of security and maybe some direction,<br />
&#xa0;but you may not be expressing that need right from the onset.<br />
You will be showing some kind of affiliation needs or being friendly to people.<br />
Or you may even be asking for some kind of help, like directions.<br />
You may be like doing it in an incremental manner.<br />
That is also a strategy that a lot of people adopt.<br />
<br />
What we find<br />
&#xa0;is that when you have an important need, you do not necessarily always express it right away.<br />
When we look at how beautiful dramas evolved in human relationships that we read in literature.<br />
Very often these relationships go through a process.<br />
And then it is the relationship<br />
&#xa0;that creates the opportunity for people to become more aware of their own needs.<br />
It is not a linear process.<br />
It is the same thing with emotion I would have to say.<br />
When we talk about emotions, we probably didn't get into this too much.<br />
We were talking about how to express emotions,<br />
&#xa0;actually one of the things that is great about relationships,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;is that if I am in a relationship<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;that provides me with space where I can just freely express my emotions<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;without being afraid of being judged, being attacked, that would be wonderful.<br />
I would say the same thing about needs.<br />
My relationship with that is a space, a trusting safe space for me to just express my needs.<br />
It would be wonderful.<br />
It is not just how we do it.<br />
We want to be doing it nicely, doing it well.<br />
But we also are looking forward to developing relationships<br />
&#xa0;that would open up the space for this kind of expression to happen more freely and spontaneously.<br />
<br />
And I guess the more complex the need, or the more emotions involved,<br />
&#xa0;the better relationship you have have to be able to express it.<br />
Very true.<br />
And then we can also say the same thing about<br />
&#xa0;the more able you are to do that, it will help to build a relationship.<br />
In a relationship when both parties can express their needs and their emotions freely,<br />
&#xa0;then I think, both parties are open and embracing and accepting.<br />
Then, I think, the relationship would grow.<br />
So, you're right.<br />
And it will then start a virtuous cycle,<br />
&#xa0;things getting better, out of self-understanding, more effective communication,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;like expanding the shared space in the relationship.<br />
That would be wonderful.<br />
