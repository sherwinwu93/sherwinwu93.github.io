<h2 id="orgb71e455">3-2 3.4 Reception - Ideas 1 - Attitudes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb71e455">
<p class="verse">
So we kind of talked about how factual content is pretty straightforward<br />
&#xa0;and we learn about it throughout most of our lives.<br />
Yeah.<br />
What about the underlying attitudes that people have when they say things,<br />
&#xa0;and how does that sort of affect the interpersonal understanding of others?<br />
<br />
When people talk about facts, as we said, they're not really only talking about facts.<br />
Say for example,<br />
&#xa0;when people are talking about the weather in the elevator and like sort of a communication,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;like of I'm your friend, I mean no harm, you can feel safe.<br />
Sometimes it can also be, I'm interested in talking to you.<br />
So, the facts are rarely just facts.<br />
<br />
And how facts are being presented and what facts are selectively used<br />
&#xa0;are also very important ways for people to be telling you something important about themselves.<br />
Say for example, when we have someone trying to tell you about marriage and divorce,<br />
&#xa0;and when someone says &gt;&gt; more and more people &gt;&gt; are getting divorced.<br />
Yeah.<br />
Which may or may not be factually accurate depending on where you're are,<br />
&#xa0;but when someone tells you something like that,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;we wonder, you are asking the question, why is this person telling me this?<br />
What attitude is communicated?<br />
If someone is saying, you know, the increased divorce rate in the case like social disintegration,<br />
&#xa0;that shows you this person's values and this person's worldview.<br />
If someone tells you that, you know,<br />
&#xa0;rising divorce rates means that more people are now exercising their agency and autonomy<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;when the relationship is not working,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;I walk out and I'm not going to put up with things that I don't tolerate, I don't enjoy.<br />
So, there are different ways of using the same fact, right?<br />
Mm-hm.<br />
<br />
So this is like how when we're listening for facts, we always ask, like why is it selected?<br />
What is this person talking about?<br />
Like you have a discussion of minimum wage,<br />
&#xa0;for instance, some people will say that, you know, this is going to hurt the economy.<br />
Then you will know that this person probably is speaking from the position of an employer.<br />
Mm-hm.<br />
Like someone who runs a business,<br />
&#xa0;rather than from the position of an employee or from labor rights and interests.<br />
So, you have things like that.<br />
I can come up with tons of examples.<br />
Usually, when people state the fact, the fact is selected, and it is stated with the purpose.<br />
It is important for us to be able to decipher what kind of position the person is assuming,<br />
&#xa0;the purpose of using this fact, what effect this person is expecting this utterance to have.<br />
