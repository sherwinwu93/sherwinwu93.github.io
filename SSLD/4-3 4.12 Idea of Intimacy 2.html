<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org87e4bf7">
<p class="verse">
Right and I guess those are some of the things<br />
&#xa0;that are really important to you in terms of a relationship.<br />
And I mean, I think a lot of things you mentioned are like,<br />
&#xa0;there's a certain level of intensity there, right?<br />
Which you said maybe not everyone wants in a relationship.<br />
Is that okay if not everyone wants to reach<br />
&#xa0;that kind of intense growth-enhancing and self-actualization sort of level?<br />
<br />
Yeah, absolutely.<br />
I would say, you know I said earlier, like I think when I was younger, I was more idealistic.<br />
I was hoping<br />
&#xa0;that maybe everyone getting involved in relationships should be striving toward the same ideal.<br />
Then as I grow and I gain more experience,<br />
&#xa0;I realize that is not, first of all, something that everyone wants.<br />
It may not even be something that everyone needs.<br />
It might not even be something that is good for everyone.<br />
Some people are pretty happy being in a relationship that is functional,<br />
&#xa0;like taking care of each other and then things become routine and familiar.<br />
It gives them a sense of order, a sense of familiarity, of security.<br />
And they just enjoy it, and I think that's perfectly fine.<br />
Like not everyone wants to grow and change and constantly.<br />
So I think that's perfectly okay.<br />
<br />
The key thing here is of course that the two partners are wanting the same thing, right?<br />
So like, it would be a problem if someone really wants to grow and develop.<br />
While the other person is saying don't change, I want everything to stay the same.<br />
Then it would create some kind of tension, and sometimes it will not be sustainable.<br />
But I would say if both partners have their needs addressed and gratified<br />
&#xa0;and they're enjoying the relationship, the relationship is working for them.<br />
I don't see any reason<br />
&#xa0;why they should be striving towards the same ideals that I am aspiring,<br />
&#xa0;like, they are just my thing.<br />
