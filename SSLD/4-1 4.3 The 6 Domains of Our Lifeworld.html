<h2 id="org232c7e3">4-1 4.3 The 6 Domains of Our Lifeworld</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org232c7e3">
<p class="verse">
Okay, so now I can definitely see<br />
&#xa0;why a simple cost benefit analysis really doesn't do the trick<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;in explaining all of our behaviours and understanding of a relationship.<br />
So obviously then we need something a little bit more complex to understand.<br />
Why do we go into relationships and leave them, right?<br />
Yeah, well I think one of frameworks that we use in the SSLD system<br />
&#xa0;is to look at human life in six domains.<br />
So we look at the Environment, we look at the Body, we look at Motivation, we look at Cognition.<br />
Emotion and Behaviour.<br />
So when people are talking about like a relationship,<br />
&#xa0;people actually get involved by mobilizing,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;sort of like not exactly an even coordinated action or operation involving these six domains.<br />
<br />
So say for example, when we are in the same physical environment.<br />
Like when you talk about office romance for instance, right.<br />
And two persons in a same office, but they may seem to be like in the same environment.<br />
But like if one person is sort of in a more senior position and another person in a junior position.<br />
They are not actually in the same environment, alright?<br />
<br />
And when we talk about body or physical characteristics.<br />
We understand that you know,<br />
&#xa0;there is actually no objective value or meaning that we can assign to physical features.<br />
Like say for example, we talk about skin colour.<br />
Some people are attracted to certain skin colour,<br />
&#xa0;some people feel good about their skin colour, some people don't.<br />
So again it is not standard,<br />
&#xa0;people have very different takes on their body<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and like we can say the same thing about body build, right?<br />
Like some people prefer people who are taller.<br />
Some people want themselves to be taller.<br />
But some people are just happy with whatever they are.<br />
Some people want to have like more sexy figures, some people don't really pay too much attention.<br />
So and then there are other physical characteristics that some people may pay a lot of attention to.<br />
Like some people are obsessed with hair maybe,<br />
&#xa0;some people are obsessed with ears or eyes, you know.<br />
So we have an endless list of individual differences when we talk about the body.<br />
<br />
And then when we talk about motivation,<br />
&#xa0;it is also important to recognize<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that not everyone assigns the same significance to relationship.<br />
Some people can be more focused on their family of origin<br />
&#xa0;than a new relationship that's developing.<br />
Some people want to, you know,<br />
&#xa0;get this courtship like engagement marriage and raising a family done with that<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;then focus on his or her career.<br />
All right, so, but to some people, relationship is central to their lives.<br />
So again, like in the motivation domain, people can be very different.<br />
<br />
And when we come to cognition,<br />
&#xa0;then obviously like we have different values, different world views, different belief systems,<br />
&#xa0;and then we also spend a fair bit of time earlier in this course<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;talking about the scripts that you have internalized.<br />
Or you have started authoring for yourself, and it is very much in the cognitive domain.<br />
<br />
And then in the emotional domain,<br />
&#xa0;then obviously people have different emotional needs, and different emotional patterns.<br />
Some people get very excited by a certain gestures of caring and love, some people don't, right.<br />
Some people have tremendous problems regulating themselves emotionally and get over-aroused.<br />
Some people can get easily frustrated and then get angry.<br />
Some people don't.<br />
So, again, in the emotional domain you have all sorts of individual and interpersonal differences.<br />
And then when it comes to the actual behaviour,<br />
&#xa0;like how people actually behave and what do they actually say, what do they actually do,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;there's a huge diversity there.<br />
<br />
So this is why when we look at relationships<br />
&#xa0;we really have to engage with all these six domains at least,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;[LAUGH] I would say, there actually can be more.<br />
So a simple cost benefit arithmetic analysis, I don't think would do the trick.<br />
<br />
To summarize the six domains of life mentioned in lecture.<br />
They are Environment where you are in a given time.<br />
Physical body, characteristics and features of ourselves and others.<br />
Motivation such as needs, wants, incentives for what we are doing.<br />
Cognition, your thoughts, ideas, values and belief system.<br />
Emotion,<br />
&#xa0;which are your feelings and emotional patterns, needs, reactions, regulation abilities, etc.<br />
And lastly, behaviour of how we actually say something,<br />
&#xa0;what we do, or how we react in a given interaction.<br />
These six domains<br />
&#xa0;will provide a more comprehensive picture of the human experience within a relationship.<br />
