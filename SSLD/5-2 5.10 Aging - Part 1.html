<h2 id="org1f992ca">5-2 5.10 Aging - Part 1</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1f992ca">
<p class="verse">
So when we talk about people who are older or growing older in life.<br />
Obviously, we will be looking at the changing N3C as well.<br />
So like circumstances change, and you know, when people grow older, their needs will change, right.<br />
Say for example, some of us will be needing assistance to just move around.<br />
Some of us may even need help to address our basic physical needs for survival, you know.<br />
So obviously not every aging person needs that.<br />
Like some people can be very healthy and very active.<br />
And not only can they take care of themselves, they can also take care of other people.<br />
They may still continue to do wonderful things, creative things<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;like making significant contribution to humankind,<br />
&#xa0;so there's a diversity of needs.<br />
<br />
And in our society, we have this arrangement,<br />
&#xa0;which is also gradually being transformed itself, the institution of retirement, right?<br />
So the concept itself is being redefined and you know, stretched.<br />
But then we also understand that like people are going through some kind of transformation,<br />
&#xa0;like maybe you are working full time at a place, and then you become part time.<br />
Or you stop working and you become self-employed, or you stop working.<br />
Obviously your relationship with your co-workers would be transformed.<br />
Mm-hm.<br />
Right, like take me as an example.<br />
I'm working in a university.<br />
And if I stop doing this,<br />
&#xa0;then my relationship with my students and my co-workers, it will be changed.<br />
So that is the kind of transformation that we expect.<br />
<br />
What is like more challenging about this situation<br />
&#xa0;is that very often people do not understand the changing needs.<br />
And then certain needs will therefore go neglected.<br />
The couple of examples that I can give<br />
&#xa0;will be you know the need for the personal space, for your autonomy, for your agency,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;to assert itself, like taking risks for example.<br />
In a lot of situations we encourage younger people to take risks.<br />
Say for example, you have a toddler walking and falls.<br />
The toddler will be encouraged to stand up and walk again.<br />
You have a 90-year old person like walking and falls.<br />
Then people will be encouraging him or her to use a wheelchair.<br />
Right.<br />
All right, so that is a very different understanding.<br />
And young people can get into high risk or high impact sports,<br />
&#xa0;but if an older person wants to take risks with<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;what he or she wants to do in a long-term care facility,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that person usually is discouraged.<br />
So some of the needs would be neglected.<br />
<br />
Another big topic that I always talk about is the sexual and intimacy needs, right,<br />
&#xa0;which is one of the key topics that we are interested in this course.<br />
And you know like older people also have like sexual needs and needs for intimacy,<br />
&#xa0;but those are usually not recognized.<br />
Yeah, I think I feel like a lot of society doesn't believe that,<br />
&#xa0;you know, we become asexual once we've hit a certain age.<br />
Or it's considered strange if you have, I don't know, sexual desires and that kind of thing, yeah.<br />
<br />
So and then the other thing is<br />
&#xa0;other than that<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;you find that because of the ageist discourse and practice that we have around us,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;like older people are usually scripted in sort of like a passive role.<br />
You have like even TV commercials<br />
&#xa0;showing you know old people waiting around during Christmas for the family to visit<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;or you know like waiting for grandchildren to call.<br />
And they're expected to be thrilled when that happened.<br />
And I think there is some systematic bias here, right,<br />
&#xa0;Imagining their lives to be without content, without fun.<br />
And I believe that a lot can be done by society and also by the older people themselves<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;to change that impression and also to enrich their lives<br />
&#xa0;so that you know the characteristics as older people<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;will be positively valued rather than pathologized.<br />
<br />
And then we also have to recognize that they have capacity that can be developed.<br />
I have been like working a lot in the last few years with people with dementia.<br />
And one of the things that I am fully convinced with many, many examples<br />
&#xa0;is that people even when they're diagnosed with dementia,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;many of these people can actually still continue to learn and develop.<br />
Like when we are expected to think of them as generally deteriorating in all aspects of life,<br />
&#xa0;well, which do happen, right?<br />
They do experience some deterioration or some decline in some functions.<br />
But it doesn't mean that they cannot learn new stuff,<br />
&#xa0;and it doesn't mean that their lives cannot be enriched by doing things differently.<br />
So I believe that the transformation, right, of their own condition<br />
&#xa0;and the relationship with the world can be reimagined.<br />

5-2 5.10 老龄化 - 第一部分<br />
当我们谈论年长者或步入老年的人时，显然，我们也会关注N3C的变化。<br />
随着环境的变化，人们的需求也会发生改变，对吧。<br />
比如说，有些人可能需要帮助才能四处走动。<br />
有些人甚至需要协助来满足基本的生存需求。<br />
当然，并不是所有老年人都需要这些帮助。<br />
有些人可能仍然非常健康和活跃。<br />
他们不仅能够照顾自己，还能照顾他人。<br />
他们甚至可以继续做出卓越的贡献，创造有意义的事物，为人类社会做出重大贡献。<br />
所以，老年人的需求是多样化的。<br />
</p>

<p>
在我们的社会中，存在着这样一种制度——退休制度，而它本身也在逐步发生转变。<br />
退休的概念正在被重新定义和拓展。<br />
与此同时，我们也看到人们正在经历某种转变。<br />
比如，一个人原本是全职工作，然后变成兼职。<br />
或者他完全停止工作，成为自由职业者，或者直接退休。<br />
很显然，他与同事之间的关系也会因此发生变化。<br />
嗯哼。<br />
就拿我自己来说吧，我在大学工作。<br />
如果我不再做这份工作，那么我和我的学生、同事之间的关系也会改变。<br />
这种变化是可以预见的。<br />
</p>

<p>
然而，这种情况更具挑战性的一点是，很多时候，人们并不了解老年人需求的变化。<br />
因此，某些需求往往被忽视。<br />
举几个例子，比如个人空间、独立性、自主性以及自我表达的需求，比如冒险精神。<br />
在很多情况下，我们鼓励年轻人去冒险。<br />
比如，一个蹒跚学步的幼儿摔倒了，我们会鼓励他站起来再试一次。<br />
但是，如果一个90岁的老人摔倒了，人们则会建议他坐上轮椅。<br />
对吧？<br />
这是一种完全不同的理解。<br />
年轻人可以从事高风险或高冲击性的运动，<br />
但如果一个老人在长期护理机构中想要冒险尝试自己想做的事情，<br />
通常他会被劝阻。<br />
因此，某些需求就被忽略了。<br />
</p>

<p>
另一个我经常谈论的重要话题是性与亲密关系的需求。<br />
这是本课程中我们关注的关键问题之一。<br />
老年人同样有性需求和亲密关系的需求，<br />
但这些需求往往得不到认可。<br />
我觉得社会上很多人认为，<br />
一旦到了某个年纪，我们就会变得“无性化”。<br />
或者，如果老年人仍然有性需求，<br />
人们会觉得这很奇怪，对吧？<br />
</p>

<p>
除此之外，由于社会存在年龄歧视的话语和实践，<br />
老年人往往被描绘成一种被动的角色。<br />
比如，我们在电视广告中看到，<br />
老年人坐在那里，等着家人圣诞节来探望，<br />
或者等着孙子孙女打电话。<br />
当家人真的来看望他们时，他们被期待表现得欣喜若狂。<br />
但我认为，这里存在某种系统性的偏见。<br />
这种刻板印象将老年人的生活想象成无趣、无内容的状态。<br />
我相信，无论是社会还是老年人自身，<br />
都可以做很多事情来改变这种印象，同时也丰富老年人的生活。<br />
这样一来，老年人的特质将被积极地看待，而不是被病态化。<br />
</p>

<p>
此外，我们也必须认识到，老年人依然有可以发展的能力。<br />
在过去几年里，我一直与失智症患者合作。<br />
通过大量实例，我深信，<br />
即使是被诊断患有失智症的人，<br />
他们中的许多人依然可以继续学习和成长。<br />
虽然我们倾向于认为，他们的各方面能力都会全面退化，<br />
的确，他们在某些方面会经历衰退或功能下降，<br />
但这并不意味着他们无法学习新事物。<br />
这也不意味着，他们的生活无法通过不同的方式变得更加丰富。<br />
因此，我相信，<br />
他们自身的状态以及他们与世界的关系，<br />
都可以被重新想象和塑造。<br />
