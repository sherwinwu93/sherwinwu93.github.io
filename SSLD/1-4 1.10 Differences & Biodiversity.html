<h2 id="orgddadc61">1-4 1.10 Differences &amp; Biodiversity</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgddadc61">
<p class="verse">
Well, in the SSLD system, we pay a lot of attention to individual differences.<br />
And differences can be a challenge in relationships.<br />
Because, like when people are negotiating relationships,<br />
&#xa0;when someone thinks differently, acts differently,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;believes in different things, like looks at things differently,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;it can sometimes create a problem or a challenge.<br />
So how can people understand the value of difference<br />
&#xa0;is an important first step in understanding relationships.<br />
So a key concept that we are now taking in from the life sciences and the social sciences<br />
&#xa0;is this concept of biodiversity.<br />
The SSLD system embraces what we call a diversity positive attitude,<br />
&#xa0;meaning that like we like diversity, we enjoy diversity.<br />
We think that diversity is a good thing.<br />
<br />
So why do we think so?<br />
Well, first of all, biodiversity is actually a condition for human evolution.<br />
I do not want to give you a whole lecture on biology here.<br />
But like if you're interested,<br />
&#xa0;you can easily have access to<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;like all sorts of interesting discussions and documentation on this concept of biodiversity.<br />
So for natural selection to happen, we need to have biodiversity,<br />
&#xa0;so we have the like various variations of like manifestations of genes and phenomena,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;so that natural selection can take place.<br />
So that is like one of the most important points.<br />
The second point that I want to make is that relationship always involves differences, right?<br />
So otherwise, like you will be only developing a relationship of a clone of yourself, right?<br />
Anyone else that you're developing a relationship with, will have something that is different.<br />
So being able to deal with the difference is actually the key to the success of any relationship.<br />
And managing diversity, in our opinion, is part and parcel of human growth and evolution,<br />
&#xa0;whether we're talking about like individual personal growth or like collective social development.<br />
The ability to manage diversity is always essential.<br />
What we want you to remember is<br />
&#xa0;that being able to deal with differences is actually the key to the success of any relationship,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and that managing diversity is part of human growth and evolution.<br />
That is<br />
&#xa0;why understanding the importance of biodiversity would help you embrace the differences of others.<br />
