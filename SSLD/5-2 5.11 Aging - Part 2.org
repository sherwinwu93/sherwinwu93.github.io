#+begin_verse
Not only I guess are we learning new things as older adults,
	but we can also engage in a new relationships, if I'm correct, right?
Oh Yeah, like we're talking about transformations.
So obviously, like some relationship will be transformed
	like the old person's relationship with like partners,
		friends, co-workers, children, you know, acquaintances.
Like Obviously transformation can take place.
But you are right, an important dimension that is very often neglected
	is that older people also like develop new relationships all the time, right?
It can be like a caregiver,
	it can be like a friend that you meet in the seniors' activity center,
		or like for people who move into retirement housing or long-term care facilities,
	they're going to start new relationship with a lot of people.
So their entire life world will be transformed,
	and I think more attention actually should be paid
		to help these people manage this relationship again with the same purpose.
That is like, they manage this relationship so that their needs are being met.
So I think this is an emphasis that we really want to bring on.
And when we're talking about older people, right,
	we want them to feel supported
		and really want them to have the opportunity to develop or learn skills for them
			to be you know, managing these new relationships effectively.
			
And one little point that I want to add, which is sort of like stretching the concept a bit.
When we talk about relationships, we usually talk about relationships with people, right?
But I think with older people I have like this idea
	that like very often they are also going through
		transformation of their relationship with the world, with objects.
Like someone who has been driving, for example, for 60 years
	would have to stop driving and use public transportation or you know, taxis or whatever.
So your relationship with certain things will change.
And the other thing that I really want to at least mention
	is their relationship with the body will also change, right.
So the body doesn't respond in the same way that you want it to.
And some of us unfortunately, might have been abusing our bodies for too long,
	like through unhealthy health practices like smoking, drinking,
		you know doing drugs, excessive eating or like unhealthy eating.
So we may have to redefine or renegotiate the relationship with our body,
	so that our needs are being met in a better way, you know.
So yeah, I think growing old has a lot to do with managing relationships effectively.

5-2 5.11 老化 - 第二部分

不仅仅是我们在年长时仍然学习新事物，我们还能建立新的关系，对吧？
哦，是的，我们在谈论的是转变。
显然，一些关系会发生变化，比如老年人与伴侣、朋友、同事、子女，甚至熟人的关系。
这些关系都会经历转变。
但你说得对，一个常常被忽视的重要方面是，老年人也会不断建立新的关系，对吧？
比如，他们可能会与照护者建立关系，或者在老年活动中心结识新朋友。
对于搬入退休社区或长期护理机构的老年人来说，他们会开始与许多新的人建立关系。
因此，他们整个生活世界都会发生变化。
我认为，我们需要更加关注如何帮助他们重新管理这些关系。
其核心目的仍然是为了满足他们的需求。
这正是我们想要强调的重点。

当我们谈论老年人时，我们希望他们感受到支持。
我们也希望他们有机会发展或学习新技能。
这样，他们才能够有效地管理这些新关系。
此外，我还想补充一点，这可能稍微扩展了“关系”的概念。
通常，我们谈论的关系是人与人之间的关系。
但对老年人而言，我认为他们往往还经历着与世界、与物品关系的转变。

比如，一个开车 60 年的人可能不得不停止驾驶。
他们可能需要改为使用公共交通、出租车或其他交通方式。
那么，他们与某些事物的关系就会发生变化。
另外，还有一点我想特别提到，那就是他们与自己身体的关系也会改变。
身体不再像以前那样灵活地响应我们的需求。
有些人可能长期以来一直在损害自己的身体。
比如通过吸烟、饮酒、吸毒、暴饮暴食或不健康饮食等方式。
因此，我们可能需要重新定义或调整自己与身体的关系。
这样才能更好地满足自身需求。

所以，我认为，变老很大程度上是在于如何有效地管理各种关系。
