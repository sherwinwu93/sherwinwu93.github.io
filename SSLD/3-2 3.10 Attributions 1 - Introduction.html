<h2 id="org51fa113">3-2 3.10 Attributions 1 - Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org51fa113">
<p class="verse">
In your book, you talk about how one way to make sense of people's attitudes and opinions is<br />
&#xa0;to take a look at their attributional frame.<br />
I'm wondering if you can sort of explain what that is.<br />
<br />
Well, yeah, when people experience something, see something,<br />
&#xa0;they usually will make some attribution,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that's trying to explain it,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;or trying to point out or find out what the cause or what we are experiencing might be.<br />
So I'm an immigrant in this country,<br />
&#xa0;so I remember when I first came to this country<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and people were blaming the immigrants for driving up the housing prices.<br />
And then it was so interesting that within the same newspaper that I read,<br />
&#xa0;[LAUGH] on the same day, there was another commentary saying that,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;this neighbourhood is now having a lot of immigrants coming in.<br />
There are minorities, and it is driving the real estate prices down.<br />
[LAUGH]<br />
<br />
So you can always attribute something to something, whether it is factually true or not.<br />
And then, obviously, when I was going through that, I was going, okay, all right,<br />
&#xa0;when you say that the immigrants are driving up the real estate prices,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;so who are paying the high prices?<br />
Mm-hm.<br />
It would be the immigrants.<br />
Who are getting those high prices?<br />
[LAUGH] Yeah.<br />
[LAUGH] The people who are selling the real estate, right?<br />
So why is it a problem?<br />
<br />
But then you can very often see people making attributions like that.<br />
And then very often, we also make attributions in relationships.<br />
Say for example, in a breakup situation, people would try to figure out why are we breaking up?<br />
Why is she or why is he leaving me?<br />
And people usually want to attribute it to something simple, right?<br />
So he is leaving me for a younger woman, right?<br />
And you're attributing it to age, right?<br />
Mm-hm.<br />
When you're saying that he doesn't need my financial support anymore,<br />
&#xa0;you're attributing it to a financial reason for this relationship breakup.<br />
Yeah.<br />
So this may or may not be true.<br />
We don't know, right?<br />
<br />
But my general approach to this is<br />
&#xa0;that when someone tells you something, the person is always attributing.<br />
Attribution is something that we constantly do.<br />
So whenever you ask the reason why,<br />
&#xa0;when you ask the reason for a decision to be made, of an action to be taken,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;there is always attribution involved.<br />
And this is important for us to be able to figure this out.<br />
<br />
Here's a definition of the concept introduced in this lecture.<br />
Attribution: it's when one is regarding something as being caused by something else.<br />
This can happen in any situation when you try to explain the cause of an experience,<br />
&#xa0;whether it is factually true or not.<br />
For example, let's say a couple has broken up and the man is now with a much younger girl.<br />
You might think that he left the previous partner for a younger woman,<br />
&#xa0;and attributing the cause of their breakup to age.<br />
