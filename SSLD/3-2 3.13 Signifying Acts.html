<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8e3e6eb">
<p class="verse">
It sounds like in order to build more trust and to build better relationships,<br />
&#xa0;understanding the other person is really vital.<br />
And so I'm wondering how to build that understanding and those skills at understanding other people.<br />
Well, like in North America I think the emphasis is on listening.<br />
So you listen carefully to the other person, what the other person is saying.<br />
This is a very verbal culture and we privilege the spoken word.<br />
But I have to say that careful listening is important<br />
&#xa0;and this is why we have like identify these different content areas<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;like facts, attitude, emotions and needs.<br />
But I also want to emphasize that we do not only gain understanding through listening.<br />
If we pay attention, we observe to what other people are doing, right?<br />
People sometimes can express their feelings and very significant emotional state<br />
&#xa0;through other channels than talking.<br />
<br />
One of the concepts that I really want to introduce is the concept that I call 'Signifying Acts',<br />
&#xa0;which simply refers to acts or actions that we take that signify something.<br />
Give you an example,<br />
&#xa0;in some cultures it is not appropriate for parents to apologize to their children<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;if they've done something wrong.<br />
So say for example,<br />
&#xa0;you have like a four year old walking down the hall<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and inadvertently take off the power line to her dad's computer.<br />
And the dad yelled at her and then immediately, he felt bad,<br />
&#xa0;like I shouldn't be doing this to my four year old.<br />
But then like maybe in his culture, apologizing might not be the best thing to do.<br />
This person might then go up to his daughter and say hey,<br />
&#xa0;are you interested in taking a walk in the park, getting some ice cream, right?<br />
That is sort of an indirect way of saying, I'm sorry.<br />
I shouldn't have yelled at you, right.<br />
That is considered a signifying act.<br />
<br />
And one of the stories that I really like sharing and I actually had it in a book, right,<br />
&#xa0;is that we have this story from West China, like rural, mountainous area.<br />
We had this girl who was betrothed to be married to a wealthier person because her family was broke.<br />
She absolutely didn't want to get married to this guy,<br />
&#xa0;and her plan actually, was to commit suicide on her wedding night.<br />
Before the wedding, she actually fell in love with another person.<br />
So she was caught in very difficult position and then she had this filial obligation to her father.<br />
So before she got married what she did was she walked down this mountainous area,<br />
&#xa0;it was like about ten kilometres walk, in this mountainous terrain, to go to the Yellow River,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and get a bucket of water to take it home, to wash her father's feet.<br />
So that is nothing was spoken, not a single word.<br />
But it's a very intense, profound expression of emotion, right?<br />
So this is what I mean by 'Signifying Acts'.<br />
<br />
So being able to accurately decipher the code,<br />
&#xa0;'Signifying Acts' is a skill that we all need to learn.<br />
And then, what I tried to point out earlier with this various examples is<br />
&#xa0;that this 'Signifying Acts' carry different meanings across different cultural contexts.<br />
So what works in North America may not apply well in South America or in Africa or in Asia.<br />
So a certain cultural understanding is also important for us<br />
&#xa0;to be able to understand or receive these messages correctly.<br />

Listening carefully to what the other person is saying is very important,<br />
	so we have identified four different content areas: facts, attitude, emotions and needs.<br />
But we do not only gain understanding through listening,<br />
	because people can express their feelings and emotions through other channels than talking.<br />
One of the ways is 'Signifying Acts' which refers to action people take to signify something.<br />
For example, a father has just yelled at her five year old daughter<br />
	because she inadvertently took off the power line to his computer.<br />
Insteading of apologizing to her directly,<br />
	he asked her whether she wanted to go to park and eat ice cream.<br />
It meaned that he was sorry that he shouldn't have yelled at her.<br />
'Signifying Acts' is a skill that we all need to learn to understand other people better.<br />
Besides, it manifests very differently in different cultures.<br />
