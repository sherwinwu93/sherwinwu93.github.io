#+begin_verse
Okay, so you know couples can fall on one end of the spectrum or the other.
And it could work for them at the time, but then they could also be changing.
So ultimately, what is it that can keep them together, keep them working together?

You are now bringing some complication into this nice simple picture, but like, yeah.
Okay, so you're right.
So, we are talking as if couples can be at one point or the other on the spectrum.
But like in real life, obviously, the two parties can be slightly apart or wide apart.
You may have one person wanting this and one person wanting that.
When they are closer to each other, then obviously it is easier to negotiate.
It very often happens when they come from the same like religious background
	or same geographical location, very similar culturally.
And they have decided to follow sort of the same script,
	then it would be easier for them to negotiate.
So if we are doing this, then it would be a stable and good for both of us.
But whenever there is some difference in understanding, or maybe a huge difference.
Someone like me,
		who was sort of like more towards like happenings, and you know growth, transcendence
	and then you have someone who is like seeking stability and order.
Then the obvious challenge is to negotiate.
It is possible that even good negotiation and communication wouldn't solve the problem
	and they may not want to be in the relationship together.
That's possible.
But I would say in most situation,
	if they can learn to communicate more effectively, appreciate each other's position better.
We always get back to the SSLD, N3Cs kind of analysis.
They will have a way, better chance of negotiating something that might work for them.

The other thing, of course we are always aware of,
	is that people do not necessarily stay at the same point all through their lives, right?
You may have people who with desire, a lot of happenings and then all that in one stage of life.
And then later on they want to be more stable and seek a sense of order.
You can have people moving in the other direction,
	like you may have grown up in an environment that really valued this stability and order.
And then one day you discover that you really want something else
	and you want to move to that end of the spectrum.
And then there were people who might have moved back and forth a few times in their life course.
So yeah, all these are possible.
But I think, if you really want to maintain the relationship through all this,
	this is why we pay so much attention to change and growth and communication and all that.
I think the key thing still is,
	being true to yourself,
		but communicate very effectively, and in the process, negotiate a win-win strategy.
So that both parties would achieve a certain level of satisfaction out of this.

4-4 4.24 实现双赢安排

好吧，所以你知道，伴侣可能会处在光谱的一端或另一端。
这在当时可能对他们有用，但他们也可能会发生变化。
那么最终，是什么能够让他们在一起，保持合作呢？
你现在在这个简单的画面中引入了一些复杂性，不过，是的。
好的，你说得对。
所以，我们谈论的是伴侣可能处在光谱的某一个点上。
但在现实生活中，显然两方可能略有差异或存在较大的分歧。
你可能会遇到一个人想要这样，而另一个人想要那样的情况。
当他们彼此距离较近时，显然谈判会更容易一些。
这种情况通常发生在他们来自相同的宗教背景、地理位置相近或文化上非常相似时。
如果他们决定遵循类似的生活脚本，那谈判对他们来说会更容易一些。
如果我们这么做，那么这将是一个稳定且对双方都有益的方案。
但每当在理解上有一些差异，或者是巨大的差异时，就会带来挑战。
像我这样的人，更倾向于追求变化、成长和超越，
而你可能遇到一个人更倾向于寻求稳定和秩序。
显然，挑战就在于如何进行谈判。
有时，即使进行良好的谈判和沟通，也未必能够解决问题，
他们可能不愿意继续在一起，这种情况也是可能发生的。
但我想说，在大多数情况下，
如果他们能够学会更有效地沟通，更好地理解对方的立场，
我们总是回到 SSLD 和 N3Cs 这样的分析工具。
他们会有更大的机会协商出一个适合他们的方案。
当然，我们始终需要意识到的是，
人们并不一定会在一生中都停留在同一个点上，对吧？
可能有些人在人生的某个阶段渴望变化和经历，
然后后来他们想要更多的稳定和秩序感。
也可能有人朝另一个方向发展，
比如，你可能成长于一个非常重视稳定和秩序的环境中，
然后有一天你发现自己真正想要的是其他东西，
你想要走向光谱的另一端。
还有一些人可能在人生中来回转换了几次。
所以，是的，这一切都是可能的。
但我认为，如果你真的想要在这些变化中维持关系，
这也是为什么我们如此关注变化、成长、沟通等等。
我认为，关键仍然是忠于自己，但要非常有效地沟通，
并在这个过程中协商出一个双赢的策略。
这样双方都能从中获得一定程度的满足感。
