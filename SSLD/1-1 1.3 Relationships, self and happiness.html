<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org35feb3a">
<p class="verse">
Well, relationships are also important because they do not only meet our needs,<br />
&#xa0;but they also help us define who we are.<br />
In a way, it's actually quite fair to say<br />
&#xa0;that like we become who we are as a result of the relationships that we have.<br />
As children we got exposed to like people who took care of us like our parents<br />
&#xa0;and they might tell us like that we are smart or we are ugly or we are pretty<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;or like we are stupid, that we are selfish or like we have wonderful, nice characters.<br />
So all this feedback that we got like from relationships<br />
&#xa0;will fit into this sense of self that we now carry.<br />
So it is really important to look at like<br />
&#xa0;how relationships are impacting on who we think we are, what we think we are.<br />
<br />
Well, relationships are the key to our happiness, quality of life and our sense of well-being.<br />
There is actually like significant research evidence pointing in the direction<br />
&#xa0;that like the quality of your relationship<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;actually has a direct impact on your overall quality of life.<br />
And, whatever we are thinking of, like in our quest for happiness,<br />
&#xa0;it has to be negotiated through building relationships with other people.<br />
So, that's why it is so important for us<br />
&#xa0;to be paying more attention to understanding how relationships work in our lives.<br />
