It sounds like there are almost patterns<br />
&#xa0;that you can pick up with people<br />
&#xa0;based on how they present facts<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and the kind of underlying attitudes and positions that they take.<br />
Yes.<br />
So that takes us on to the other dimension.<br />
So say for example you may sometimes hear a couple fighting.<br />
And then someone will be accusing the other person.<br />
I never know this, whatever that is,<br />
&#xa0;like income or your looks or the size of your breasts or whatever is so important to you.<br />
But very often, when you think back on how this person talks about other persons,<br />
&#xa0;this is what we call characterization, right?<br />
Right.<br />
It's telling you a lot about what is important to this person.<br />
<br />
Say for example, this person who is telling you about his or her friends,<br />
&#xa0;and every time you mention someone he or she knows<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;it will always be referring to this person's profession, income.<br />
That means to this person, professional status and income are important.<br />
Or someone is telling you about his or her friends.<br />
Constantly referring to this person's physical features.<br />
Height, hair color, body shape.<br />
So that also tells you that to him or her, these are important.<br />
If someone tells you about someone always where this person comes from.<br />
&#xa0;which country, or ethnicity, or religion for that matter.<br />
Then that tells you more about this person than the people that this person is talking about.<br />
<br />
So, giving you an example, like if I tell you that Jane is such an animal lover, right?<br />
That means animal lover is a label that has significance for me, right?<br />
And if I, for another person, they would not be animal lover.<br />
For another person is like, Jane is such a music lover, right?<br />
Yeah.<br />
So when I tell you something about Jane, I'm actually telling you something about me.<br />
Okay.<br />
So this is like what we refer to as like the characterization frame.<br />
<br />
Right, right.<br />
And I guess then, in what a person tells you can also affect how they are seeing you.<br />
Yeah, exactly.<br />
I am referring constantly to these dimensions.<br />
You're right.<br />
I may actually be using the same parameters or same dimension.<br />
In my assessment of you, who you are and your value as a human being.<br />
As a friend I may be actually be referring to this.<br />
Say for example<br />
&#xa0;if I think that education is important<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and then I'm interacting with someone who is less educated.<br />
If I keep referring to people's educational credentials and background<br />
&#xa0;you have sense that like, where do I stand?<br />
[LAUGH]<br />
Yeah, exactly.<br />
Yeah, so I guess that sort of answers this question<br />
but what is the benefit of being able<br />
&#xa0;to pick up on something in your interactions with individuals.<br />
Well, I would say that most people actually were able to do that.<br />
What we are trying to say here is to basically draw your attention to those different dimensions.<br />
So when we are listening to people,<br />
&#xa0;we understand that we shouldn't just be paying attention to facts.<br />
We know that there are other dimensions as well<br />
&#xa0;and that we pay attention to those dimensions<br />
&#xa0;and sometimes when we're asked questions like, why is this person saying this?<br />
It will actually help us to gain a more in-depth understanding of what the other person is up to.<br />
Right.<br />
Yeah.<br />
