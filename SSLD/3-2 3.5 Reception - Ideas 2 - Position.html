<p class="verse">
It sounds like the importance is not just what the fact is telling us, or the fact itself.<br />
But it's, why was that fact selected?<br />
And what is the person's position on that particular fact?<br />
<br />
Yeah, exactly.<br />
So, especially when people are thinking of developing a more significant relationship,<br />
&#xa0;it is actually important to understand that.<br />
Because some people, say for example,<br />
&#xa0;they start building relationship and then all of a sudden relates to the person involved.<br />
It comes on suddenly,<br />
&#xa0;that, I've never thought that this person actually values his or her family so much.<br />
To the extent that I added on piece to his or her life<br />
&#xa0;because to him or her the family is weigh more important than me or than this relationship.<br />
<br />
And when people find themselves in this situation and then when they think back,<br />
&#xa0;actually maybe in the eight months they were dating,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;this message has been communicated to this person maybe 800 times, right?<br />
Yeah.<br />
But you just missed it, right?<br />
So the person may be saying that like I have to do this because his family, right?<br />
Or, I am not going to care what is going to happen, Thanksgiving? I'm back to Calgary.<br />
So this is selective presentation, or framing of facts,<br />
&#xa0;and they do not listen between the lines and are missing out on the most important piece.<br />
If someone is telling you that this Thanksgiving I have to go to New York or Calgary, or wherever.<br />
It is not just a fact or that I am doing it.<br />
It is also telling you this is important.<br />
This is what is important in my life.<br />

It is especially important when people are developing a significant relationship.<br />
For example, it suddenly occur to someone<br />
