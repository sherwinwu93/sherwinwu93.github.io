<h2 id="org12d3a9f">4-3 4.18 Physical Intimacy and Presence</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org12d3a9f">
<p class="verse">
So you promised me that we could talk a bit more about physical intimacy.<br />
A big part of a lot of people's idea of physical intimacy comes down to sex.<br />
And then of course, we have a lot of stereotypes about you know who enjoys sex more,<br />
&#xa0;like you know the male persuasion liking sex more.<br />
People getting into relationships just so they can engage in sexual relations.<br />
Is there truth to any of these stereotypes?<br />
Well, I think with any stereotype, there are always exceptions, right?<br />
So obviously, there are a lot of people who,<br />
&#xa0;at least think that sex is the thing that they're after.<br />
And then like in the media, we are also increasing the portraying of women<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;as active seekers of pleasurable sexual experience,<br />
&#xa0;which in a way is a good thing, but it also falls to another stereotype.<br />
<br />
So what is important from my perspective is that people know what they want and what they need.<br />
And we have already said what you want is not necessarily what you need.<br />
Like some people want sex because they need self-affirmation, they need to be accepted.<br />
Some people want sex because they need physical pleasure.<br />
Some people want sex because they need to please other people to get positive feedback.<br />
Some people want sex<br />
&#xa0;because they need to get to somewhere or get something done through having sex with people.<br />
So, you know like the need that's driving the sex can be very varied,<br />
&#xa0;and sex is just one of the many ways that people can utilize to meet those needs.<br />
<br />
So, and then it also takes us back to this idea of physical intimacy versus sex.<br />
Because sex is also very difficult to define, you know.<br />
Bill Clinton once tried, without much success, right,<br />
&#xa0;convincing the world that oral sex is not really sex.<br />
And maybe, only genital penetration is sex, some people still stick to that kind of imagination.<br />
So we have to understand that physical intimacy actually entails way more than that.<br />
Some people will feel very intimate physically<br />
&#xa0;when they are sitting by the fire side and reading to each other<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;or like taking a walk in the woods.<br />
Some people would feel like physically very intimate just by sitting next to each other.<br />
So like the idea of physical intimacy is actually pretty fluid.<br />
And I don't want to say that like sex is categorically different.<br />
No, it is only part of it.<br />
And then of course, how much physical intimacy is involved in the act of sex itself also varies.<br />
Like when you talk about people who are getting sex from like sex workers, for instance.<br />
They may have sex, but they may not be physically intimate at all, right?<br />
Yeah.<br />
So it is important to be able to distinguish between these two concepts.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I mean, even going off of that,<br />
&#xa0;you can literally not be physically together at all,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;but still be engaged in what some people define as sex.<br />
So, you know, People talk about sexting, or cyber sex,<br />
&#xa0;or even, you were mentioning earlier in an interesting documentary<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;where people had sex telepathically.<br />
So there really is a range in terms of how we define it, isn't there?<br />
Yeah, I think this is actually another good point.<br />
And I don't not want to confuse people, but that's another concept, right,<br />
&#xa0;which is probably not familiar to most people in the social sciences.<br />
It is the idea of presence.<br />
So you can be like in Toronto, you know, communicating with someone in Ecuador,<br />
&#xa0;and there's a huge geographical distance, but you can feel the person's presence right here.<br />
And for some people,<br />
&#xa0;you can actually say that I actually feel physically very intimate with this person<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;even though we're just like having a conversation on Skype.<br />
That is totally like comprehensible.<br />
And then when you're talking about people having cyber sex or sexting,<br />
&#xa0;the extent to which it feels physically present also varies.<br />
Like for some people, they are very conscious,<br />
&#xa0;we just like this is just the image, this is just text.<br />
To some people, they actually feel the physical presence.<br />
Some people feel their own physical response.<br />
Some people are better able to communicate a physical response to others through images and words.<br />
Some people are less capable.<br />
So like the experience, the quality of the experience actually varies a lot.<br />
Yeah, but I think you're pointing out a very important dimension.<br />
So physical intimacy has to be understood within a context,<br />
&#xa0;which is more than physical distance or geographical distance, yeah.<br />

4-3 4.18 身体亲密与存在感<br />
</p>

<p>
所以你答应过我，我们可以更多地谈谈身体上的亲密关系。<br />
很多人对身体亲密的理解，很大一部分集中在性上。<br />
当然，我们也有很多关于谁更享受性的刻板印象，<br />
比如认为男性更喜欢性，或者有人进入关系只是为了进行性行为。<br />
这些刻板印象有多少是真实的呢？<br />
嗯，我认为任何刻板印象都有例外，对吧？<br />
显然有很多人，至少认为性是他们追求的目标。<br />
此外，在媒体中，我们也越来越多地看到女性被描绘成<br />
主动寻求愉悦性体验的形象，这在某种程度上是件好事，但也可能成为另一种刻板印象。<br />
</p>

<p>
从我的角度来看，重要的是人们清楚自己想要什么以及需要什么。<br />
我们之前也说过，想要的不一定是需要的。<br />
比如，有些人想要性，因为他们需要自我肯定，渴望被接受。<br />
有些人想要性，因为他们需要身体的愉悦。<br />
有些人想要性，因为他们希望取悦他人以获得正面反馈。<br />
还有一些人想要性，是因为他们需要通过性行为达到某种目的或实现某些目标。<br />
所以，推动性行为的需求是多种多样的，而性只是人们满足这些需求的众多方式之一。<br />
</p>

<p>
这也把我们带回到身体亲密与性之间的区别这个话题上。<br />
因为性本身也很难定义。<br />
比如比尔·克林顿曾经尝试说服世人，口交不算真正的性，但并不成功，对吧？<br />
有些人可能仍然认为只有生殖器的插入才算性。<br />
因此，我们必须理解身体亲密实际上包含的范围远远超过性本身。<br />
有些人会觉得，当他们坐在火炉旁为对方朗读，或在树林里散步时，非常亲密。<br />
有些人仅仅是坐在彼此身旁，也能感受到身体上的亲密。<br />
因此，身体亲密的概念实际上是相当灵活的。<br />
我并不是要说性完全与之不同。<br />
不，性只是其中的一部分。<br />
当然，性行为本身涉及的身体亲密程度也有很大差异。<br />
比如，当你谈到人们从性工作者那里获得性行为的情况时，<br />
他们可能发生了性行为，但完全没有身体上的亲密感，对吧？<br />
是的。<br />
所以，能够区分这两个概念非常重要。<br />
</p>

<p>
是的，甚至在此基础上，<br />
你实际上可以完全没有身体接触，但仍然参与某些人定义为性的行为。<br />
比如，人们谈论的“情色短信（sexting）”或“网络性行为（cyber sex）”，<br />
甚至你之前提到的一个有趣的纪录片，其中有人通过“心灵感应”进行性行为。<br />
所以，如何定义性确实存在很大的范围，对吧？<br />
是的，我认为这是另一个很好的观点。<br />
我不想让人感到困惑，但这里涉及另一个概念，<br />
这可能是大多数人、甚至社会科学领域的人都不太熟悉的，<br />
那就是“存在感”的概念。<br />
比如，你可能人在多伦多，与厄瓜多尔的某人交流，<br />
地理距离非常遥远，但你可能感觉到对方就在你身边。<br />
对于一些人来说，<br />
他们可能会说，即使我们只是通过 Skype 交谈，我仍然感到身体上非常亲密。<br />
这是完全可以理解的。<br />
当谈到人们进行网络性行为或情色短信时，<br />
他们对“身体存在感”的感受也有所不同。<br />
有些人非常清楚这只是影像或文字，<br />
但对另一些人来说，他们确实感受到身体的存在感，<br />
甚至感受到自己的身体反应。<br />
有些人更善于通过图片和文字将身体反应传递给他人，<br />
而有些人不太擅长。<br />
因此，这种体验的质量实际上差异很大。<br />
是的，但我认为你指出了一个非常重要的维度。<br />
身体亲密必须在一个超越身体距离或地理距离的上下文中理解。<br />
