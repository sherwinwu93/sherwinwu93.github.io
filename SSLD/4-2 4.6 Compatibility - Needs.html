<h2 id="org74368fc">4-2 4.6 Compatibility - Needs</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org74368fc">
<p class="verse">
Okay, so that gives me a really good idea about how power fits into relationships.<br />
What about the concept of compatibility?<br />
Yeah, I think this is like very important for us to understand<br />
&#xa0;how this whole sequence of concepts link together, right?<br />
So we talk about power,<br />
&#xa0;and then obviously, like power has something to do with these ideas of fairness and equity.<br />
And then when you talk about fairness and equity,<br />
&#xa0;you're looking at some kind of balance in the relationship.<br />
<br />
And obviously, we want to be paying attention to compatibility.<br />
And when we look at compatibility,<br />
&#xa0;we're also actually implicitly asking the question of sustainability, of feasibility.<br />
Is it going to work? Right?<br />
So, and then, as we know in SSLD analysis, we will start with needs.<br />
The N3C.<br />
Exactly, yeah.<br />
So we will be starting with N3C, and the first thing is needs.<br />
<br />
So basically, when we have like two individuals that are attracted to each other,<br />
&#xa0;one of the things that we always speculate<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;is that some kind of needs are being met either at a very conscious level<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;or at like a not so conscious level.<br />
Someone may be like looking for some compensation of the lack of security<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that this person experienced as a child,<br />
&#xa0;and so this person wants to be in a very stable relationship.<br />
Some people are trying to sort of like compensate for the incomplete family that he or she had<br />
&#xa0;and was fascinated or obsessed with this idea of a healthy family.<br />
So you also have people who are like abused as a child,<br />
&#xa0;who got very confused<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and think that someone who is strong, dominating, and protective would be attractive, you know.<br />
And then, there are like people with a similar background really scared of people<br />
&#xa0;who are strong and like you know, dominating.<br />
So these different needs, right, will all be operated.<br />
And the problem is in a lot of situations,<br />
&#xa0;people are not even aware that they're driven by these needs.<br />
So it is really important, in the beginning phase of a relationship,<br />
&#xa0;for people to pay more attention to what needs are being triggered, like the need, compatible.<br />
<br />
And I just want to point out a few important processes from SSLD perspective.<br />
One is that there are always irrational needs.<br />
So we do not need to be worried about them,<br />
&#xa0;we just need to be more conscious of them and deal with them.<br />
The other thing is needs do change.<br />
And in an ideal situation, when you are involved in a good relationship,<br />
&#xa0;the relationship would actually help you grow and develop better understanding.<br />
You'll feel better about yourself, you become more capable of communicating your needs.<br />
And you've also become like more capable of understanding the needs of your partner,<br />
&#xa0;and both of you will grow.<br />
And then some of these needs will be met.<br />
And then when some of these needs are met,<br />
&#xa0;say for example, an insecure person having his or her security needs met, right?<br />
And then it will prepare this person to move forward and develop a stronger intimate relationship,<br />
&#xa0;and the person may also be more driven towards like self-improvement, and growth and all that.<br />
So the need profile of each participant, ideally, can also change and even improve, yeah.<br />
