<h2 id="org9e7b930">3-3 3.19 Expression - Ideas 3 - Staying Attuned</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9e7b930">
<p class="verse">
It seems like being attuned to your audience or the other parties is so important<br />
&#xa0;and then I guess how can you tell if the metaphor you're using,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;for instance, they're understanding it and they're accepting your idea.<br />
Well, you have already given the key word.<br />
The key word is to stay attuned.<br />
<br />
And how do we do that?<br />
In SSLD, we're looking for specific behavioural markers when people can extend on your metaphor.<br />
Mm-hm.<br />
That means they have got the idea, or they can elaborate on it,<br />
&#xa0;or they can give you similar examples.<br />
After, say for example, you have worked with 12-year-olds, with an apple,<br />
&#xa0;and then you bring in something else now and ask them, what is this?<br />
If they can tell you a different way of classification, then you know that they have got the idea.<br />
Say for example, after you've taken in the apple,<br />
&#xa0;and then you say you are bringing a cat and ask people, what is this?<br />
It's a cat, what is a cat?<br />
And then people can say well, it's an animal or it's a pet.<br />
And then you can ask, so can the cat be something else?<br />
And if they can answer, if someone can tell you,<br />
&#xa0;the cat can actually be a guide, be a therapist,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;or the cat can be a teacher, or the cat can be part of your decor.<br />
The cat can be your message to your customer about how this space is an animal friendly space.<br />
Then you know that these students are getting the idea.<br />
So you stay attuned,<br />
&#xa0;you're looking for extension of your idea or specific application of it, elaboration.<br />
<br />
And sometimes, especially in the pedagogical or educational setting, you can actually ask people.<br />
What is the idea that you have got?<br />
This skill of clarification actually works both ways,<br />
&#xa0;and this is something that we encourage in communication.<br />
Sometimes you would just say to the other person that I just do not want to misunderstand you,<br />
&#xa0;so I'm going to tell you what I've heard from you is that what you are saying to me.<br />
That it's like seeking clarification and confirmation.<br />
<br />
Sometimes you can be doing the same.<br />
Yeah, I just want to make sure that we're on the same page,<br />
&#xa0;I have talked about this, can you tell me what does that mean to you?<br />
Does it make sense or because we don't want to be asking this question<br />
&#xa0;that can be taken as questioning or sometimes can be,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;some people can take it as humiliating question,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;you're thinking I don't understand you or I'm not following.<br />
Instead of, do you understand?<br />
Or repeat to me what I have told you, this is sort of a more didactic top-down approach,<br />
&#xa0;we would be asking what do you think of it?<br />
Does it make sense to you?<br />
How does it make sense to you?<br />
Or sometimes to make the other party feel better,<br />
&#xa0;I've told you, do you see something wrong with this or what aspect of it you like better?<br />
So, you can be asking questions like that to get direct feedback from the other person.<br />
