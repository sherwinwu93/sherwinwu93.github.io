* 2-2 1 Sleeping well
#+begin_verse
Insomnia is an extremely common sleep disorder.
A third of the population in the western world
	experiences regular difficulties with falling asleep or staying asleep.
However, for about 10% of the population, the insomnia also causes problems in the daytime,
	such as tiredness, poor concentration, or irritable moods.
So what is insomnia?
Well, insomnia disorders diagnosed when someone has the following features:
	difficulties going to sleep,
	staying asleep - where it takes longer than 30 minutes,
	non-restorative sleep,
	impairment of daytime functioning,
	and symptoms that are present for at least three months.
The essence of insomnia is that the person feels unsatisfied with the amount or quality of sleep.
So much so that it leads to significant distress
	or an inability to function in important areas of life.
This can affect the person's relationships, work, education, social life, or other important areas.
Any sleep problems that are present for less than three months
	are not considered to meet the criteria for insomnia disorder.
It is simply thought of as an episode of insomnia rather than a disorder.
Sometimes people's sleep experience does not meet their expectations.
For example, many people wake often at night but are still able to function well during the day.
This does not constitute insomnia.

Impacts of insomnia on everyday life includes things
	such as a person feeling wired and tired, while fatigue is the overwhelming symptom.
If the person often feels sleepy, they may also have another type of sleep disorder,
	such as untreated obstructive sleep apnoea and/or restless leg syndrome, periodic limb movement.
The most important factor in the sleepy insomnia individual is depression
	where there is a strong bidirectional relationship.
Both of these disorders require equal treatment.
People with insomnia often feel that their performance is significantly reduced.
But the research does not always show objective impairments.
People with insomnia often have difficulty switching tasks along with some aspects of memory.
In one study, a functional MRI, a top of brain scan,
	was used to measure blood flow in certain areas of the brain.
Individuals with insomnia had reduced blood flow in some areas
	when asked to participate in some cognitive tasks in the scanner.

Perhaps the most important thing is the way people think about the sleep.
Some people with insomnia can become extremely preoccupied with their sleep
	and develop a condition termed sleep anxiety.
Instead of being an important component of healthy life,
	sleep becomes a stressful focal point of all the activities
		the person is not able to do due to their chronic poor sleep quality, perceived or otherwise.
Behavior may become ritualized to ensure better sleep.
And individuals might also give up the little pleasures of life,
		such as exercise, coffee or socializing,
	for fear that these activities will negatively impact on sleep.
Many people start spending more and more time in bed
	trying to achieve at least 50% of that time sleeping.
This is a common but unhelpful behavior as it is the development of sleep anxiety.
Interestingly, in a recent study of nurses doing shift work:
	tiredness, anxiety, depression, bullying in the workplace,
		and spillover between work and family life were significant factors related to insomnia.
However, insomnia was more likely to be caused by personal and work related factors
	rather than being a cause of the problems.

We also have a number of sleep myths.
And there are three common misperceptions regarding sleep.
One being that good sleepers sleep through the night and do not wake until the morning,
	when they wake refreshed.
Number two, we start the night in light sleep and finish sleep in deep sleep.
So if the sleep period is shortened, in any way, then sleep will be severely compromised.
Number three, rapid eye movement sleep is deep sleep.

This hypnogram shows the stages of sleep
	that a normal adult will cycle through during a good night's sleep.
REM sleep means rapid eye movement and is a lighter sleep stage during which dreams occur.
Stage three or N3 is the deepest stage of sleep.
In humans, most of the night is spent in relatively light sleep.
An evolutionary overflow, most likely from our caveman days,
	when it was important to be alert for predators.
Only 20% of the night is spent in deep sleep and 25% in REM sleep.
We cycle through all the stages of sleep every 90 minutes
	and most of our deep sleep is in the first one third of the night
		with mostly lightest stages in the latter part of the night.
The onset of sleep is triggered by increasing darkness that causes the brain to produce melatonin.
Light suppresses melatonin and leads to waking.
The role of temperature is also important and changes with sleep onset and waking.
A healthy 70 year old will cycle through the same stages of sleep
	but somewhat more rapidly during the night.
So sleep patterns change of a person's lifetime.

So how do we treat insomnia?
Medication is usually the first line of treatment
	when an individual presents to their GP with insomnia.
In a 2010 study,
	95% of people were given a sedative medication with almost half being prescribed Temazepam.
Only 2% were referred to a psychologist for psychological treatment,
	which we know is the proven and most effective treatment long-term.
Cognitive behavioral therapy or CBT aims to enable a person with insomnia
	to gain confidence about his or her sleep
		by giving factual information about sleep in order to combat the many common myths.
Some examples are: 'I must stay in bed longer to make up for my lost or poor quality sleep'
	and 'I only doze in the second half of the night.'
CBT is approached as a retraining in sleep with the aim of reducing some of the pressure
	that people tend to place on themselves when trying to change the behavior.
Along with the behavior changes is the need to change perceptions and expectations of sleep
	which is equally important.

There are some strategies for managing sleep patterns.
One is bed or sleep restriction therapy
	which means reducing the time spent in bed by either going to be later or getting up earlier.
This can improve the length and quality of a sleep.
Avoiding unhelpful cues associated with the bed,
		such as using computer screens or television in the bedroom,
	can also be helpful.
The quarter hour rule means that if you are awake for more than a quarter of an hour,
	it is helpful to get out of bed and do a quiet activity
		until you are comfortable with that but not necessarily sleepy.
Paradoxical intention is a strategy that involves putting the effort into staying awake.
Paradoxically, this makes you sleepy.
It is also important to have exposure to early morning light, regular exercise, and a healthy diet.
Avoiding caffeine or alcohol close to bed time can also be useful.
If depression is an issue,
	managing your mood in conjunction with changing sleep behaviors and thoughts
		is both effective and useful.
Relaxation and mindfulness strategies help to reduce anxiety and can promote sleep.
These are covered in other sections of the course.
Using these strategies,
	people with insomnia learn to go from being a victim of poor sleep
			to changing the boundaries around the bed and the night,
		and can learn to sleep well again.

2-2 1 睡得好

失眠是一种极为常见的睡眠障碍。
在西方世界，三分之一的人经常会遇到入睡或保持睡眠的困难。
然而，大约10%的人在白天也会因此受到影响，例如疲劳、注意力不集中或情绪易怒。

那么，什么是失眠？
失眠障碍的诊断标准包括以下特征：

入睡困难，
保持睡眠困难（入睡时间超过30分钟），
睡眠质量欠佳，
白天功能受损，
症状持续至少三个月。
失眠的本质在于，个体对自身的睡眠时间或质量感到不满意，
以至于这种不满导致了显著的痛苦，或者影响到了重要的生活领域。
这可能会影响个人的人际关系、工作、教育、社交生活或其他重要方面。

如果睡眠问题持续时间少于三个月，
那么它不符合失眠障碍的诊断标准，
而只是一次失眠的经历，而非一种疾病。

有时，人们的睡眠体验未能达到他们的预期。
例如，许多人夜间经常醒来，但白天仍然能够正常运作，
这种情况并不构成失眠。

失眠对日常生活的影响包括：
个体可能感到精神紧绷且疲惫，但主要症状仍然是极度的疲劳。
如果一个人经常感到困倦，那么他们可能患有另一种睡眠障碍，
例如未治疗的阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停综合症（OSA）、
不宁腿综合症（RLS）或周期性肢体运动障碍（PLMD）。

对于那些因失眠而感到困倦的人来说，
最重要的影响因素是抑郁症，
而失眠与抑郁症之间存在强烈的双向关系。
这两种疾病都需要同等的关注和治疗。

失眠患者常常觉得自己的表现大幅下降，
但研究并未总能显示出客观的损害。
失眠患者在任务切换和某些记忆方面可能会遇到困难。

在一项研究中，科学家使用功能性磁共振成像（fMRI）
来测量大脑某些区域的血流量。
当受试者执行某些认知任务时，
失眠者的大脑某些区域的血流量减少。

或许最重要的是，人们如何看待睡眠。
一些失眠患者可能会对睡眠产生极度的焦虑，
并发展出一种被称为“睡眠焦虑”的状况。

睡眠本应是健康生活的重要组成部分，
但对这些人来说，
睡眠却变成了一个压力源，
让他们不断关注自己因长期睡眠质量差而无法完成的事情——
无论这种睡眠质量的下降是真实的还是感知上的。

他们的行为可能变得仪式化，以确保更好的睡眠。
此外，个体可能会放弃生活中的一些小乐趣，
比如锻炼、喝咖啡或社交，
因为他们害怕这些活动会对睡眠产生负面影响。

许多人开始花越来越多的时间待在床上，
试图确保至少有一半的时间是用来睡觉的。
但这是一种常见且无益的行为，
它实际上助长了睡眠焦虑的发展。

有趣的是，在最近一项针对轮班工作的护士的研究中，
疲劳、焦虑、抑郁、工作场所欺凌，
以及工作与家庭生活之间的冲突，
都是与失眠相关的重要因素。

然而，失眠更可能是由个人和工作相关因素引起的，
而不是这些问题的直接原因。

我们还存在一些关于睡眠的误区，
其中有三种常见的错误认知：

好的睡眠者整夜不醒，直到早晨醒来时神清气爽。
我们在夜晚开始时处于浅睡眠，最后进入深度睡眠，
因此，如果睡眠时间被缩短，睡眠质量将受到严重影响。
快速眼动（REM）睡眠是深度睡眠。
这个睡眠图示（睡眠波形图）展示了一个健康成年人
在良好夜间睡眠中的各个睡眠阶段。

REM 睡眠（快速眼动睡眠）是一个较轻的睡眠阶段，
在此期间会发生梦境。
第三阶段（N3）是最深的睡眠阶段。

对于人类来说，大部分夜晚的时间都处于较浅的睡眠状态。
这种进化遗留可能源自我们的穴居时代，
当时保持一定的警觉度以防捕食者至关重要。

一个健康成年人在深度睡眠中度过的时间大约占20%，
在 REM 睡眠中度过的时间约占25%。
我们每90分钟循环一次所有睡眠阶段，
大部分深度睡眠发生在夜晚的前三分之一，
而后期大部分是较轻的睡眠阶段。

睡眠的开始受黑暗程度的增加所触发，
黑暗促使大脑分泌褪黑素。
光线会抑制褪黑素的分泌，并导致醒来。

温度变化在睡眠启动和清醒过程中也起着重要作用。
一个健康的70岁老人同样会经历相同的睡眠阶段，
但其夜间睡眠周期的转换速度可能会更快。
这表明，睡眠模式会随着人的一生而发生变化。

那么，我们如何治疗失眠呢？
当一个人因失眠而去看医生时，
药物通常是首选的治疗方法。

在2010年的一项研究中，
95%的患者被开具了镇静剂，
其中近一半的人服用了替马西泮（Temazepam）。
然而，仅有2%的患者被转诊至心理学家接受心理治疗。
而我们已知，心理治疗才是长期最有效的治疗方法。

认知行为疗法（CBT）旨在帮助失眠患者重建对睡眠的信心，
通过提供有关睡眠的真实信息来消除常见的睡眠误解。

例如：

“我必须在床上待更长时间，以弥补丧失的睡眠。”
“我在夜晚后半程只是打盹。”
CBT 的目标是重新训练睡眠模式，
减少个体在尝试改变睡眠行为时施加给自己的压力。

除行为调整外，改变对睡眠的认知和期望同样重要。
一些管理睡眠模式的策略包括：

睡眠限制疗法：减少在床上的时间，例如晚点上床或早点起床，
这样可以改善睡眠的长度和质量。
避免床上不相关的刺激：例如，不要在卧室里使用电脑或电视。
“15分钟规则”：如果清醒超过15分钟，
建议起床进行安静的活动，直到感到舒适，但不一定要困倦。
悖论意图：刻意尝试保持清醒，反而会让人更容易入睡。
早晨阳光暴露、规律运动和健康饮食：都有助于改善睡眠。
避免睡前摄入咖啡因或酒精。
如果抑郁是一个问题，
那么结合情绪管理和睡眠习惯调整，
将是既有效又有益的做法。

放松训练和正念冥想可以减少焦虑，促进睡眠。
这些内容将在课程的其他部分进行详细介绍。

通过这些策略，
失眠患者可以从受失眠困扰的状态，
逐渐调整睡眠环境和习惯，
最终恢复良好的睡眠质量。
