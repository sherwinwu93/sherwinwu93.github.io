The Strength Recovery approaches take an optimistic view of the outcome of mental health diagnosis based on good evidence that outcomes are not always poor.
Recovery approaches focus on meaningful goals, desires, dreams and talents for a person's life.
The Strengths Model was developed over 30 years ago by Charles Rapp & Rich Goscha at the University of Kansas.
It provides an overarching philosophy, as well as practical tools for identifying and working with strengths.

There is emerging evidence for clinical benefit with the Strengths Model and a clinical trial is underway.
Working together at the Bondi Junction Community Rehabilitation team, we introduced the Strengths Model in 2013.
We wanted to be able to increase the sense of hope and positivity for our clients.
And we found that sometimes directing all our energies to working out problems wasn't helping people enough.
It's sad when clients say, "No one ever asked me what I wanted to do.
" With the Strengths Model, they're active and motivated to work on their recovery.
Our role was re-oriented to helping people find solutions to achieve their goals, and to find meaning and purpose.

Previously, some people felt discouraged from achieving their goals, for example, to work because practitioners felt it might be too much of a challenge for them.
Whereas with the Strengths Model, clients could be helped to identify their strengths before jumping into goal setting, and they were then able to identify goals or passions that were really motivating for themselves.
With the Strengths Model, we found that clinical outcomes were improved.

The Strengths Model is based on six principles.
People can recover.
The relationship between clinician and client is paramount.
The focus is on strengths.
The client drives the process.
The community is the prime setting and the community is an oasis of resources.
Now to compare a Strengths assessment with the more traditional mental health assessment, both describing the same client called Dan.
A Strengths assessment of Dan might sound like Dan is a 50-year-old man, and he tells me, "I am happy where I live in my own apartment.
I cook my own meals.
I do volunteer work every week.
I have sought admission when my symptoms were overwhelming.
I saved for a recent overseas trip with my family.
I am looking for more employment.
I like to travel, read, watch cricket.
My beliefs are a source of strength.
" Whereas a traditional assessment might sound like, "Dan is a 50-year-old male.
He was diagnosed with schizophrenia in his early 20s when he was studying for a professional degree.
He's been under the care of a psychiatrist in GP since then.
He's been unable to return to study and he's had several admissions due to homicidal ideation.
"

You can see that the first assessment sounds more hopeful and would make you think more positively about Dan's ability to achieve his goals.
While the Strengths assessment does seem to miss the fact that he has had significant risk issues like homicidal ideation, this isn't our only source of information as therapists.
Strengths assessments always occur alongside mental state and risk assessment processes.
We always ensure that safety is a priority.
Our work is mainly with people who are fairly stable in the community and so the focus is more on recovery of function.
If we are able to present the story in a more hopeful way, then the therapists and the client can feel that goals are achievable.

Implementing the Strengths Model we have been able to help our clients to achieve their goals and this has significantly boosted morale on our team.
We've also found that there's been a trickle down effect to other community teams where they have now started to adopt these practices.
Coming from a humanist philosophical standpoint, the Strengths Model celebrates and respects each person's individuality and encourages hope.
