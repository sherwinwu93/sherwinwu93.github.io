#+begin_verse
Stress, stress, stress.
We seem to read about stress everywhere,
	and more and more, it's seen as a factor in our health, affecting body, mind, and brain.
So in this talk, we're going to spend a little time on stress,
	its positive and more difficult sides, and what to do to tame it.
This will dovetail with a lot of the other talks on our MOOC
	because stress is one of the newer kids on the block,
		and we need to know a lot about it to promote our well-being and flourishing.
		
The whole idea comes out of notions from last century,
	that human beings, like other animals,
		like to operate within a comfortable zone a lot of the time.
Nowadays, we call that our window of tolerance.
We don't mind getting towards the edge of the zone for a little while.
For example, we can enjoy getting excited, a little anxious, a little angry, or a little scared,
	if it's in a good and safe enough cause.
Most people might enjoy something like getting excited about the outcome of the footy match,
		that's what Australian's call football, or in a ball game,
	and getting terrified in a safe way, by the ride on, say, a roller coaster.
However, part of our eagerness to do these things
	is we know that they're mostly safe for the majority.
And the feelings and body sensations will settle safely,
	and we will feel back to normal
		some time not too long after the game, or the big day out at the amusement park.
		
When we get out of our comfort zone,
	the stress begins to dramatically rise, and then we find situations distressing.
We can notice changes in our body
		like pulse rate rising uncomfortably, blood pressure escalating,
	or we feel distressing levels of emotion.
At even more extreme levels,
	we can begin to feel frozen or trapped, or even disconnect or dissociate.
Then, we need to use ways to calm back down and feel more comfortable.
Most of us do this best
	by using soothing from others and ways we've learnt through life to calm down.
	
After particularly stressful events or periods,
	we may even need a solid period of rest and recovery.
We don't always make time for that in our busy modern lives.
Positive psychiatry talks about using ways to settle that promote our well-being and don't hurt us.
So, using our connecting conversations with others,
	good exercise, that mindfulness, meditation, breathing to calm down,
		rather than drugs or alcohol, just as an example.
When we can't manage the high stress,
	it can begin to do damage to our well-being and become traumatic,
		meaning that our normal coping is overwhelmed.
The good news is that even here we can often recover,
	and often become more resilient in the process.
At other times, cumulative or overwhelming stress is traumatic.
And then we need strong pathways to recovery, and what's called post-traumatic growth.
That's where we grow as a result of difficult circumstances.

Just to be clear, stress is not just all in the mind.
Our bodies really feel it.
And too much stress can contribute to many illnesses in times when mental health breaks down.
Stress triggers inflammation for example,
	and cumulative stress can literally become disorganizing for our mental and physical life.
So, learning to manage it becomes a keystone of our well being and health.

Stress regulation and stress management
	are essential part of positive psychology and positive psychiatry.
Today, we think of it as a hierarchy of stress management at the top of those strategies
	that really help us connect to ourselves and others.
And help our brains, bodies, minds reconnect, and be restored and nourished after stress.
Stephen Porges, a psychiatrist in the US,
	has been describing that we have a social nervous system,
		evolved to manage stress best via our social connections.
So at the top of the hierarchy for managing stress are the ways
	we connect and calm and soothe each other in relationships and connective conversations.
Our facial expression, and our capacities to speak and use body language,
	have actually developed in evolution to help this process.
For example, we really value and feel better
	when somebody shows, by expression and gesture, that they get us and what we're talking about.
We begin to calm down.
We feel really good after a shared laugh or occasionally a shared cry,
	and the sharing is the connecting
		that actually nourishes a part of our nervous system called the parasympathetic nervous system.
		
We hear a lot about the sympathetic nervous system, the so-called fight and flight system.
And people have known for a long time
	that the sympathetic nervous system connects with our immediate response to high stress,
		and we see it at work in the innovation of heart and blood vessels.
It makes our pulse rate and our blood pressure go up like the accelerated pedal of a car.

However, our rest and digest and restore system is the parasympathetic system.
It works in our gut and our digestive system.
It has connections like a brake to our heart.
It powers up all of those muscles of facial expression that we were just talking about.
So the social soothing comes from parasympathetic input.
Some of it's from fast-talking nerves covered in a substance called myelin.
And they connect upwards to the most important conscious thinking parts of our brain,
	and to many systems.
	
However, we also have parasympathetic input
	from an older nervous system with fibers that are unmyelinated.
They move slower but deeper, and are responsible for some of those deep feelings in our middle
	when we are stressed and distressed.
The terrible deep feeling of grief, for example.
When stress really overwhelms us, we can get in to that older parasympathetic state of withdrawal,
	when the older parasympathetic system is dominating.
In that state, we need to slow down, take it easy, warm up.
Sometimes literally, sometimes emotionally.
Take time, get good care to recover.
After a period of more active symptoms of illness for example, whether mental or general medical,
	some people find they have a period of deep fatigue
		where they need to take things more slowly to restore energy
			and come back to their normal selves.
			
These days then, with a little science to back up the art of relaxation and stress relief,
	we encourage people to find the ways to calm down
		and to find stress and stress management strategies that work for them.
Meditation and mindfulness are powerfully effective,
	and they seem to offer a space to connect to ourselves,
		and literally help us to connect our body, brain, mind.
However, do take lots of social soothing.
Don't be afraid to get fit and busy, for example, with exercise,
	which uses the sympathetic system wisely.
But also watch when the older, deeper system, your gut,
	is telling you that you're very tired or overwhelmed,
		and need to slow down and really rest and restore in quiet ways.
Hopefully you're going to tune in to other talks
	which cover stress management through great strategies
		like relaxation, mindfulness, exercise, creativity, and play.
I love to use many of them.
Find what works for you and use them daily,
	and help your kids and those you care for to find their favorite ways.
So, as we learn to surf our stress, we get stronger.
Flexibility fosters resilience and highly connected minds and bodies, and our flourishing.

1-2 1 压力

压力，压力，压力。
我们似乎在任何地方都能看到关于压力的讨论，而且越来越多的研究表明，它是影响我们健康的重要因素，会影响我们的身体、思维和大脑。
因此，在本次讲座中，我们将花些时间来探讨压力，它的积极和困难的一面，以及如何驯服它。
这与我们的 MOOC 课程中的许多其他讲座相呼应，因为压力是近年来才受到广泛关注的领域，而我们需要深入了解它，以促进我们的幸福和成长。
这个概念源自上个世纪的理论，即人类与其他动物一样，大多数时候都喜欢在一个舒适的区域内运作。
如今，我们称之为“耐受窗口”。
我们并不介意在这个区域的边缘徘徊一会儿。
例如，如果有一个合理且足够安全的理由，我们可能会享受兴奋、轻微焦虑、愤怒或害怕的感觉。
大多数人可能会喜欢因足球比赛的结果而激动不已——澳大利亚人称之为“footy”，或者在球类比赛中感受到紧张的刺激。
此外，我们也会喜欢安全地体验恐惧，比如乘坐过山车。
然而，我们愿意做这些事情的部分原因在于，我们知道对大多数人来说，它们是相对安全的。
而且，这些情绪和身体感觉会逐渐恢复平稳，我们会在比赛结束后或在游乐园玩耍一天之后不久，回归正常状态。
当我们超出舒适区时，压力就会急剧上升，我们会发现某些情况令人痛苦。
我们可能会注意到身体的变化，比如心跳加快到不适的程度、血压升高，或者经历强烈的情绪困扰。
在更极端的情况下，我们可能会感到僵住、被困住，甚至产生脱离现实或解离的感觉。
此时，我们需要采取方法让自己平静下来，重新感到舒适。
大多数人最有效的做法是依靠他人的安抚，以及我们在生活中学到的各种自我调节的方法。
在经历特别紧张的事件或时期后，我们甚至可能需要一段时间的充分休息和恢复。
然而，在忙碌的现代生活中，我们并不总是腾出时间来休养生息。
积极精神病学提倡使用不会伤害我们、但有助于恢复的方式来平复压力。
例如，我们可以通过与他人的交流、适量的运动、正念冥想、深呼吸等方式来放松自己，而不是依赖酒精或药物。
当我们无法管理高强度的压力时，它可能会对我们的幸福造成损害，甚至变成创伤，意味着我们的正常应对能力被压垮了。
不过，值得庆幸的是，即使在这种情况下，我们通常也能恢复，甚至在这个过程中变得更加坚韧。
然而，有时，长期积累或极端的压力会带来创伤。
这时，我们需要强有力的恢复路径，以及所谓的“创伤后成长”。
这意味着我们可以在艰难的环境中成长和进步。
需要明确的是，压力不仅仅存在于我们的思想中，我们的身体同样会真实地感受到它。
过度的压力可能会导致许多疾病，并在精神健康崩溃时雪上加霜。
例如，压力会触发炎症，而长期积累的压力甚至会让我们的身心变得紊乱。
因此，学会管理压力是我们健康和幸福的关键。
压力调节和压力管理是积极心理学和积极精神病学的重要组成部分。
如今，我们将压力管理视为一个分层的体系，而最顶层的策略是那些能够帮助我们与自己和他人建立联系，并让我们的身体、大脑和心灵在压力后恢复和滋养的方法。
美国精神病学家斯蒂芬·波尔吉斯提出，我们拥有一个“社会神经系统”，它是进化而来的，最有效的压力管理方式正是通过社交连接来实现。
因此，在压力管理的最高层，我们最需要的是人与人之间的互动，比如在关系中相互安慰、进行深入的沟通。
我们的面部表情、语言表达能力以及肢体语言，实际上是在进化过程中发展出来的，用于帮助这一过程。
例如，当别人通过表情和手势表达出他们理解我们、并明白我们所讲的内容时，我们会感到放松下来。
我们会发现，和他人一起开怀大笑，或者偶尔一起流泪，会让我们感觉更好。
这种共享的情感交流实际上会滋养我们的副交感神经系统。
我们经常听到交感神经系统，也就是所谓的“战斗或逃跑”系统。
人们早已知道交感神经系统会在高度压力下被激活，它与我们的心脏和血管系统密切相关，让心跳加快、血压上升，就像汽车的油门踏板一样。
然而，我们的“休息、消化和恢复”系统是副交感神经系统。
它控制着消化系统，并通过类似刹车的机制调节心脏活动，同时也作用于我们面部表情的肌肉。
因此，社会安慰主要依赖于副交感神经系统的输入。
部分副交感神经系统通过覆盖有髓鞘的神经快速传递信号，它们向上传导到我们大脑中最重要的意识思维区域，并与多个系统相连接。
然而，我们还有一个更古老的副交感神经系统，其中的神经纤维是无髓鞘的，传导速度较慢但作用更深远。
它们负责我们在压力和痛苦时产生的深层情感，例如深深的悲伤感。
当压力真正压倒我们时，我们可能会进入这种更古老的副交感神经系统主导的撤退状态。
在这种状态下，我们需要慢下来，放松自己，并让身体变暖。
有时是字面意义上的温暖，有时是情感上的温暖。
我们需要花时间，接受良好的照顾，来恢复身心健康。
例如，在经历了一段时间的疾病（无论是心理上的还是生理上的）后，有些人会经历深度疲劳的阶段。
他们需要放慢节奏，以恢复能量，并重新回到正常状态。
如今，科学研究为放松和压力缓解提供了支持，我们鼓励人们找到适合自己的方法来放松，并制定有效的压力管理策略。
冥想和正念练习被证明非常有效，它们能帮助我们与自己建立联系，并在身体、大脑和心灵之间建立连接。
然而，我们也应该多依靠社交互动带来的安慰。
不要害怕通过运动来增强体能并保持忙碌，因为运动可以合理地利用交感神经系统。
但同时，也要倾听自己身体的信号，特别是当你的肠道感觉到极度疲惫或不堪重负时。
这时，你需要放慢节奏，真正地休息，并以安静的方式恢复能量。
希望你能继续关注其他讲座，它们会介绍许多压力管理策略，比如放松、正念、运动、创造力和游戏。
我个人喜欢使用这些方法中的许多种。
找到适合自己的方法，并每天坚持使用它们。
同时，也帮助你的孩子和你关心的人找到他们喜欢的减压方式。
因此，当我们学会驾驭压力时，我们会变得更强大。
灵活性可以促进韧性，让我们的身心更加紧密地连接，并帮助我们茁壮成长。
