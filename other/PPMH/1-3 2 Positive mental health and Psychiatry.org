[MUSIC] Good mental health is more than
just the absence of mental illness. It's a positive style of wellbeing
that includes feeling good and functioning well. Good mental health is what enables
us to live life to the full. According to the World Health
Organization, mental health is a state of wellbeing in which a person is able to
cope with the normal stresses of life, work productively, realize their potential
and contribute to the community. Mental illnesses can interfere
with people's quality of life and ability to function. However, research has shown they're not
simply opposite ends of a spectrum. In fact, some people with active symptoms
of mental illness can live a full and meaningful life, and
they're consider to be flourishing. In this section, we're using
the term positive mental health. This concept is being studied across many
different fields, using over lapping terms, such as, wellbeing,
flourishing, thriving, and happiness. Positive mental health encompasses
many aspects of life, which can be divided into emotional,
psychological, and social wellbeing. Emotional wellbeing
equates to feeling good, being happy, experiencing positive
emotions like love, joy, or compassion, and feeling generally
satisfied with one's life. Positive emotions have been
extensively studied in the field of positive psychology. Barbara Fredrickson is one of the most
prominent researchers into the positive emotions and
developed the broaden-and-build theory. This states that positive emotions tend to
widen the person's repertoire of thoughts and actions and lead to play and
exploration behavior. This leads to development of resources,
such as, social connections, environmental knowledge,
and coping strategies, all of which are essential for
wellbeing and resilience. In contrast, psychological wellbeing
is about functioning well and contributing in life. Social wellbeing is a sense
of being connected to others, belonging to a community, or
making a contribution to society. Research in psychiatry and psychology has consistently shown that
positive relationships are the most influential factor contributing
to positive mental health. This can include family, friends,
work mates, and others in the community. Happiness and wellbeing have also been
contemplated over the centuries from the ancient Greek times. Aristotle founded the classical
theory of Eudaimonia, which has come to describe the good life,
or virtuous life. The origin of the term was the concept
of striving for excellence, or becoming one's best possible self. This is symbolized by the Daimon, an inner being that represents
the greatest potential within each person. This includes developing and
using one's strength, as well as, contributing to others. Over time, researchers have held different points of
view about the best path to happiness. According to Aristotle,
the pursuit virtue, or Eudaimonia, doing good also relates to feeling good. In Fredrickson's recent study,
building positive emotions, in this case, through loving kindness meditation, led
to increases in positive functioning and resilience. For many people spiritual wellbeing is
very important to their mental health. This can mean different things
to different people, but is often expressed through religion. This can include feeling
connected to a higher power; a sense of meaning or purpose;
feelings of peace or transcendence, or connection to nature. Spirituality has also been defined as an
experience of positive emotions, such as, love, joy, compassion, or hope,
faith, gratitude, and forgiveness, which are central focus of many religions. As a branch of medicine, psychiatry is
concerned with the assessment, treatment, and prevention of mental illness,
as well as, the promotion of positive mental health. Traditionally, psychiatry has focused
more on the aspect of illness, but as with medicine as a whole, there's
an increasing focus on prevention and health promotion. Positive Psychiatry is a new terminology
that was recently defined by, Dilip Jeste, as the science and practice
of pychiatry that seeks to understand and promote wellbeing in people who have,
or are at risk of developing mental or physical illness. The goal of Positive Psychiatry is not
only to treat psychiatric symptoms, but also to enhance the wellbeing of those
with mental or physical illness. Therefore, we need to build on what is
strong, as well as fix what's wrong. For people with mntal halth disorders,
as with everyone in the community, this is our dual task in working
towards good mental health. This course will show you
self help strategies and how to seek professional help, in order
to build positive factors, as well as address problems of mental health. The field of Positive Psychiatry looks at
research on positive character traits and social factors that enhance mental health. Resilience is the quality that makes
people cope well with stress, adversity, or trauma. In many cases people are able to learn or
grow through difficult experiences, and this is known as post-traumatic growth. Positive Psychiatry uses a range
of lifestyle self-help and treatment approaches to build
mental health and treat illness. Psychiatry also uses the two
major forms of treatment, which are various types of
psychotherapies and medication. There are a number of tips
you can start using straight a way to enhance positive mental health. Firstly, building relationships. Investing time and
energy in close relationships or wider social networks can lead to
great benefits for mental health. Exercise has been shown to
increase wellbeing, as well as reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. Good physical health is related
to better mental health. So having a healthy diet,
avoiding too much alcohol or drugs, and getting regular medical
checkups can all help. Developing gratitude - a regular practice of
counting blessings or noticing the positive things,
however small, can enhance wellbeing. Try keeping a journal, and write down
three positive things for each day. Identifying your strengths and then using
them regularly can increase wellbeing. Strengths can include everyday
skills like cooking, or getting along with other people. Or, they can be different types of
intelligence, athletics, artistic or musical talent. There are many strengths
questionnaires available online. Using your strengths to help others, or contribute to the community,
creates a sense of meaning and purpose. Making a contribution to the community,
however ordinary or small, increases social wellbeing. Many people feel a sense of
contributing through meaningful work. But this could also mean volunteering, helping a neighbor, or
practicing random acts of kindness. Take some time to do
the things you really enjoy. Pleasant events lead to positive
emotions that broaden and build our coping in other areas. Flow is the state of being so highly involved in an enjoyable activity
that you lose all track of time. This usually happens when the level
of challenge is about right for your level of skill. Flow can happened during work,
hobbies, creative arts, or sports. You might want to take up meditation,
prayer, or mindfulness, or try joining a religious or
spiritual community. Many people experience their spirituality
through practicing yoga or Tai-Chi, or in the beauty of nature, such as,
going to the beach or the bush. And fnally, seek help when needed. If you're struggling to feel happy for
several weeks or more or to cope with every day life, find
meaning, or to feel connected to others, try to utilize some of
the strategies in this MOOC. And don't hesitate to talk to a friend,
and to see a doctor or a mental health professional. [MUSIC]
