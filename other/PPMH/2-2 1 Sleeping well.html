Insomnia is an extremely common sleep disorder.<br />
A third of the population in the western world<br />
&#xa0;experiences regular difficulties with falling asleep or staying asleep.<br />
However, for about 10% of the population, the insomnia also causes problems in the daytime,<br />
&#xa0;such as tiredness, poor concentration, or irritable moods.<br />
So what is insomnia?<br />
Well, insomnia disorders diagnosed when someone has the following features:<br />
&#xa0;difficulties going to sleep,<br />
&#xa0;staying asleep - where it takes longer than 30 minutes,<br />
&#xa0;non-restorative sleep,<br />
&#xa0;impairment of daytime functioning,<br />
&#xa0;and symptoms that are present for at least three months.<br />
The essence of insomnia is that the person feels unsatisfied with the amount or quality of sleep.<br />
So much so that it leads to significant distress<br />
&#xa0;or an inability to function in important areas of life.<br />
This can affect the person's relationships, work, education, social life, or other important areas.<br />
Any sleep problems that are present for less than three months<br />
&#xa0;are not considered to meet the criteria for insomnia disorder.<br />
It is simply thought of as an episode of insomnia rather than a disorder.<br />
Sometimes people's sleep experience does not meet their expectations.<br />
For example, many people wake often at night but are still able to function well during the day.<br />
This does not constitute insomnia.<br />
<br />
Impacts of insomnia on everyday life includes things<br />
&#xa0;such as a person feeling wired and tired, while fatigue is the overwhelming symptom.<br />
If the person often feels sleepy, they may also have another type of sleep disorder,<br />
&#xa0;such as untreated obstructive sleep apnoea and/or restless leg syndrome, periodic limb movement.<br />
The most important factor in the sleepy insomnia individual is depression<br />
&#xa0;where there is a strong bidirectional relationship.<br />
Both of these disorders require equal treatment.<br />
People with insomnia often feel that their performance is significantly reduced.<br />
But the research does not always show objective impairments.<br />
People with insomnia often have difficulty switching tasks along with some aspects of memory.<br />
In one study, a functional MRI, a top of brain scan,<br />
&#xa0;was used to measure blood flow in certain areas of the brain.<br />
Individuals with insomnia had reduced blood flow in some areas<br />
&#xa0;when asked to participate in some cognitive tasks in the scanner.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the most important thing is the way people think about the sleep.<br />
Some people with insomnia can become extremely preoccupied with their sleep<br />
&#xa0;and develop a condition termed sleep anxiety.<br />
Instead of being an important component of healthy life,<br />
&#xa0;sleep becomes a stressful focal point of all the activities<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;the person is not able to do due to their chronic poor sleep quality, perceived or otherwise.<br />
Behavior may become ritualized to ensure better sleep.<br />
And individuals might also give up the little pleasures of life,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;such as exercise, coffee or socializing,<br />
&#xa0;for fear that these activities will negatively impact on sleep.<br />
Many people start spending more and more time in bed<br />
&#xa0;trying to achieve at least 50% of that time sleeping.<br />
This is a common but unhelpful behavior as it is the development of sleep anxiety.<br />
Interestingly, in a recent study of nurses doing shift work:<br />
&#xa0;tiredness, anxiety, depression, bullying in the workplace,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and spillover between work and family life were significant factors related to insomnia.<br />
However, insomnia was more likely to be caused by personal and work related factors<br />
&#xa0;rather than being a cause of the problems.<br />
<br />
We also have a number of sleep myths.<br />
And there are three common misperceptions regarding sleep.<br />
One being that good sleepers sleep through the night and do not wake until the morning,<br />
&#xa0;when they wake refreshed.<br />
Number two, we start the night in light sleep and finish sleep in deep sleep.<br />
So if the sleep period is shortened, in any way, then sleep will be severely compromised.<br />
Number three, rapid eye movement sleep is deep sleep.<br />
<br />
This hypnogram shows the stages of sleep<br />
&#xa0;that a normal adult will cycle through during a good night's sleep.<br />
REM sleep means rapid eye movement and is a lighter sleep stage during which dreams occur.<br />
Stage three or N3 is the deepest stage of sleep.<br />
In humans, most of the night is spent in relatively light sleep.<br />
An evolutionary overflow, most likely from our caveman days,<br />
&#xa0;when it was important to be alert for predators.<br />
Only 20% of the night is spent in deep sleep and 25% in REM sleep.<br />
We cycle through all the stages of sleep every 90 minutes<br />
&#xa0;and most of our deep sleep is in the first one third of the night<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;with mostly lightest stages in the latter part of the night.<br />
The onset of sleep is triggered by increasing darkness that causes the brain to produce melatonin.<br />
Light suppresses melatonin and leads to waking.<br />
The role of temperature is also important and changes with sleep onset and waking.<br />
A healthy 70 year old will cycle through the same stages of sleep<br />
&#xa0;but somewhat more rapidly during the night.<br />
So sleep patterns change of a person's lifetime.<br />
<br />
So how do we treat insomnia?<br />
Medication is usually the first line of treatment<br />
&#xa0;when an individual presents to their GP with insomnia.<br />
In a 2010 study,<br />
&#xa0;95% of people were given a sedative medication with almost half being prescribed Temazepam.<br />
Only 2% were referred to a psychologist for psychological treatment,<br />
&#xa0;which we know is the proven and most effective treatment long-term.<br />
Cognitive behavioral therapy or CBT aims to enable a person with insomnia<br />
&#xa0;to gain confidence about his or her sleep<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;by giving factual information about sleep in order to combat the many common myths.<br />
Some examples are: 'I must stay in bed longer to make up for my lost or poor quality sleep'<br />
&#xa0;and 'I only doze in the second half of the night.'<br />
CBT is approached as a retraining in sleep with the aim of reducing some of the pressure<br />
&#xa0;that people tend to place on themselves when trying to change the behavior.<br />
Along with the behavior changes is the need to change perceptions and expectations of sleep<br />
&#xa0;which is equally important.<br />
<br />
There are some strategies for managing sleep patterns.<br />
One is bed or sleep restriction therapy<br />
&#xa0;which means reducing the time spent in bed by either going to be later or getting up earlier.<br />
This can improve the length and quality of a sleep.<br />
Avoiding unhelpful cues associated with the bed,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;such as using computer screens or television in the bedroom,<br />
&#xa0;can also be helpful.<br />
The quarter hour rule means that if you are awake for more than a quarter of an hour,<br />
&#xa0;it is helpful to get out of bed and do a quiet activity<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;until you are comfortable with that but not necessarily sleepy.<br />
Paradoxical intention is a strategy that involves putting the effort into staying awake.<br />
Paradoxically, this makes you sleepy.<br />
It is also important to have exposure to early morning light, regular exercise, and a healthy diet.<br />
Avoiding caffeine or alcohol close to bed time can also be useful.<br />
If depression is an issue,<br />
&#xa0;managing your mood in conjunction with changing sleep behaviors and thoughts<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;is both effective and useful.<br />
Relaxation and mindfulness strategies help to reduce anxiety and can promote sleep.<br />
These are covered in other sections of the course.<br />
Using these strategies,<br />
&#xa0;people with insomnia learn to go from being a victim of poor sleep<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;to changing the boundaries around the bed and the night,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and can learn to sleep well again.<br />

2-2 1 睡得好<br />
</p>

<p>
失眠是一种极为常见的睡眠障碍。<br />
在西方世界，三分之一的人经常会遇到入睡或保持睡眠的困难。<br />
然而，大约10%的人在白天也会因此受到影响，例如疲劳、注意力不集中或情绪易怒。<br />
</p>

<p>
那么，什么是失眠？<br />
失眠障碍的诊断标准包括以下特征：<br />
</p>

<p>
入睡困难，<br />
保持睡眠困难（入睡时间超过30分钟），<br />
睡眠质量欠佳，<br />
白天功能受损，<br />
症状持续至少三个月。<br />
失眠的本质在于，个体对自身的睡眠时间或质量感到不满意，<br />
以至于这种不满导致了显著的痛苦，或者影响到了重要的生活领域。<br />
这可能会影响个人的人际关系、工作、教育、社交生活或其他重要方面。<br />
</p>

<p>
如果睡眠问题持续时间少于三个月，<br />
那么它不符合失眠障碍的诊断标准，<br />
而只是一次失眠的经历，而非一种疾病。<br />
</p>

<p>
有时，人们的睡眠体验未能达到他们的预期。<br />
例如，许多人夜间经常醒来，但白天仍然能够正常运作，<br />
这种情况并不构成失眠。<br />
</p>

<p>
失眠对日常生活的影响包括：<br />
个体可能感到精神紧绷且疲惫，但主要症状仍然是极度的疲劳。<br />
如果一个人经常感到困倦，那么他们可能患有另一种睡眠障碍，<br />
例如未治疗的阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停综合症（OSA）、<br />
不宁腿综合症（RLS）或周期性肢体运动障碍（PLMD）。<br />
</p>

<p>
对于那些因失眠而感到困倦的人来说，<br />
最重要的影响因素是抑郁症，<br />
而失眠与抑郁症之间存在强烈的双向关系。<br />
这两种疾病都需要同等的关注和治疗。<br />
</p>

<p>
失眠患者常常觉得自己的表现大幅下降，<br />
但研究并未总能显示出客观的损害。<br />
失眠患者在任务切换和某些记忆方面可能会遇到困难。<br />
</p>

<p>
在一项研究中，科学家使用功能性磁共振成像（fMRI）<br />
来测量大脑某些区域的血流量。<br />
当受试者执行某些认知任务时，<br />
失眠者的大脑某些区域的血流量减少。<br />
</p>

<p>
或许最重要的是，人们如何看待睡眠。<br />
一些失眠患者可能会对睡眠产生极度的焦虑，<br />
并发展出一种被称为“睡眠焦虑”的状况。<br />
</p>

<p>
睡眠本应是健康生活的重要组成部分，<br />
但对这些人来说，<br />
睡眠却变成了一个压力源，<br />
让他们不断关注自己因长期睡眠质量差而无法完成的事情——<br />
无论这种睡眠质量的下降是真实的还是感知上的。<br />
</p>

<p>
他们的行为可能变得仪式化，以确保更好的睡眠。<br />
此外，个体可能会放弃生活中的一些小乐趣，<br />
比如锻炼、喝咖啡或社交，<br />
因为他们害怕这些活动会对睡眠产生负面影响。<br />
</p>

<p>
许多人开始花越来越多的时间待在床上，<br />
试图确保至少有一半的时间是用来睡觉的。<br />
但这是一种常见且无益的行为，<br />
它实际上助长了睡眠焦虑的发展。<br />
</p>

<p>
有趣的是，在最近一项针对轮班工作的护士的研究中，<br />
疲劳、焦虑、抑郁、工作场所欺凌，<br />
以及工作与家庭生活之间的冲突，<br />
都是与失眠相关的重要因素。<br />
</p>

<p>
然而，失眠更可能是由个人和工作相关因素引起的，<br />
而不是这些问题的直接原因。<br />
</p>

<p>
我们还存在一些关于睡眠的误区，<br />
其中有三种常见的错误认知：<br />
</p>

<p>
好的睡眠者整夜不醒，直到早晨醒来时神清气爽。<br />
我们在夜晚开始时处于浅睡眠，最后进入深度睡眠，<br />
因此，如果睡眠时间被缩短，睡眠质量将受到严重影响。<br />
快速眼动（REM）睡眠是深度睡眠。<br />
这个睡眠图示（睡眠波形图）展示了一个健康成年人<br />
在良好夜间睡眠中的各个睡眠阶段。<br />
</p>

<p>
REM 睡眠（快速眼动睡眠）是一个较轻的睡眠阶段，<br />
在此期间会发生梦境。<br />
第三阶段（N3）是最深的睡眠阶段。<br />
</p>

<p>
对于人类来说，大部分夜晚的时间都处于较浅的睡眠状态。<br />
这种进化遗留可能源自我们的穴居时代，<br />
当时保持一定的警觉度以防捕食者至关重要。<br />
</p>

<p>
一个健康成年人在深度睡眠中度过的时间大约占20%，<br />
在 REM 睡眠中度过的时间约占25%。<br />
我们每90分钟循环一次所有睡眠阶段，<br />
大部分深度睡眠发生在夜晚的前三分之一，<br />
而后期大部分是较轻的睡眠阶段。<br />
</p>

<p>
睡眠的开始受黑暗程度的增加所触发，<br />
黑暗促使大脑分泌褪黑素。<br />
光线会抑制褪黑素的分泌，并导致醒来。<br />
</p>

<p>
温度变化在睡眠启动和清醒过程中也起着重要作用。<br />
一个健康的70岁老人同样会经历相同的睡眠阶段，<br />
但其夜间睡眠周期的转换速度可能会更快。<br />
这表明，睡眠模式会随着人的一生而发生变化。<br />
</p>

<p>
那么，我们如何治疗失眠呢？<br />
当一个人因失眠而去看医生时，<br />
药物通常是首选的治疗方法。<br />
</p>

<p>
在2010年的一项研究中，<br />
95%的患者被开具了镇静剂，<br />
其中近一半的人服用了替马西泮（Temazepam）。<br />
然而，仅有2%的患者被转诊至心理学家接受心理治疗。<br />
而我们已知，心理治疗才是长期最有效的治疗方法。<br />
</p>

<p>
认知行为疗法（CBT）旨在帮助失眠患者重建对睡眠的信心，<br />
通过提供有关睡眠的真实信息来消除常见的睡眠误解。<br />
</p>

<p>
例如：<br />
</p>

<p>
“我必须在床上待更长时间，以弥补丧失的睡眠。”<br />
“我在夜晚后半程只是打盹。”<br />
CBT 的目标是重新训练睡眠模式，<br />
减少个体在尝试改变睡眠行为时施加给自己的压力。<br />
</p>

<p>
除行为调整外，改变对睡眠的认知和期望同样重要。<br />
一些管理睡眠模式的策略包括：<br />
</p>

<p>
睡眠限制疗法：减少在床上的时间，例如晚点上床或早点起床，<br />
这样可以改善睡眠的长度和质量。<br />
避免床上不相关的刺激：例如，不要在卧室里使用电脑或电视。<br />
“15分钟规则”：如果清醒超过15分钟，<br />
建议起床进行安静的活动，直到感到舒适，但不一定要困倦。<br />
悖论意图：刻意尝试保持清醒，反而会让人更容易入睡。<br />
早晨阳光暴露、规律运动和健康饮食：都有助于改善睡眠。<br />
避免睡前摄入咖啡因或酒精。<br />
如果抑郁是一个问题，<br />
那么结合情绪管理和睡眠习惯调整，<br />
将是既有效又有益的做法。<br />
</p>

<p>
放松训练和正念冥想可以减少焦虑，促进睡眠。<br />
这些内容将在课程的其他部分进行详细介绍。<br />
</p>

<p>
通过这些策略，<br />
失眠患者可以从受失眠困扰的状态，<br />
逐渐调整睡眠环境和习惯，<br />
最终恢复良好的睡眠质量。<br />
