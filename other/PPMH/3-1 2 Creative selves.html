Mental well-being depends on an ongoing relationship of renewal with the environment.<br />
As social beings, humans depend on communication and relationships with others for their well being.<br />
The individual mind is dependent on communication through language,<br />
&#xa0;using symbols to understand and participate in the world.<br />
<br />
From the beginning of life, humans have the ability to communicate.<br />
Babies are able to cry to express other emotions, to take turns,<br />
&#xa0;and respond musically to the rhythm and pitch of conversation.<br />
They do all of these things in relationship with parents or carers<br />
&#xa0;who engage with their baby in communication and play.<br />
It's a process<br />
&#xa0;that allows the baby to use the environment through other people as a means of growth.<br />
The human genome provides many potentials for each individual,<br />
&#xa0;but requires interaction with a good enough environment of responsive carers.<br />
This way, the infant can develop the capacities<br />
&#xa0;that will allow him or her to become a fully participating member of the human community.<br />
Compared with other species, human babies are highly dependent on adults.<br />
They take many years to develop the skills to care for themselves.<br />
<br />
Infants are not born with a sense of self.<br />
This develops over time as part of our second nature.<br />
It depends on early learning.<br />
The sense of self arises through the experience of feeling during communication and exploration.<br />
These aspects of mental life take time to become established.<br />
A sense of self is a positive achievement reflecting a sense of value in the individual.<br />
Positive and negative emotions need to be processed differently through early relationships.<br />
These relationships soothe distress on the one hand,<br />
&#xa0;and amplify a sense of aliveness in the infant on the other.<br />
This contributes to the sense of value in the infant,<br />
&#xa0;establishing a space for learning from others known as the Zone of Proximal Development.<br />
<br />
At birth, we are thrown into the human world,<br />
&#xa0;a world where one has a place in a complex matrix of relationships<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that has great meaning for each individual.<br />
Human beings, like all other species, operate within the physical world,<br />
&#xa0;but humans are unique in that we also operate in a symbolic sphere.<br />
This is to say, that humans grow inside a world of language as well as the physical world.<br />
They are able to participate emotionally and physically from the very beginning.<br />
<br />
Feelings and emotions are a component of all human experience,<br />
&#xa0;acting as an in-built value system that allows the infants and adults<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;to asses their experience, selecting interactions that promote aliveness and growth.<br />
This can be described as using your gut feeling or instinct or intuition.<br />
The types of feelings<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that arise for each person as they engage with others in the broader environment<br />
&#xa0;become characteristic for each individual.<br />
Over the last few decades, research has reexamined the role of feeling in mental life.<br />
A sense of aliveness is central to well-being and the development of mental life.<br />
All living organisms seek to explore the environment<br />
&#xa0;in order to find what they need to survive and thrive.<br />
This tendency has been called the seeking system.<br />
And is part of an innate repertoire<br />
&#xa0;that for humans extends to the relational and symbolic aspects of life.<br />
This underpins the yearning for connection,<br />
&#xa0;and the search for meaning that characterize human lives.<br />
It also means that a large part of mental life, in health, is oriented towards the future.<br />
A sense of meaning is not fixed or external to individuals<br />
&#xa0;but is created through communication, relationships, and building skills.<br />
Reality is confirmed by the recognition and response of others in communicative exchange,<br />
&#xa0;that is, in a conversation.<br />
This is one reason why people seek help for mental disturbances.<br />
They have a need for re-grounding their position through a safe and validating relationship.<br />
A sense of self can become disorganized through trauma, stress or illness.<br />
And healing relationships are needed to restore the self.<br />
<br />
For a long time, play was seen as a matter for children.<br />
This view has changed in recent decades.<br />
Play takes two forms.<br />
Physical play is shared in common with other mammal species<br />
&#xa0;and is probably crucial to the development of<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;a broad emotional range and a sense of urgency and confidence in demanding physical activities.<br />
Another kind of play characteristically human is symbolic play,<br />
&#xa0;where the child, safe in the knowledge of having a secure base with a carer not too far away,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;will happily play with toys and other objects in the environment,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;often talking as he or she plays.<br />
The toys come to represent aspects of the child's imagination<br />
&#xa0;and have a symbolic rather than simply a literal value.<br />
This kind of play helps the child develop a strong sense of their inner world,<br />
&#xa0;which gives rise to the capacity for reflection and the sense of ownership of mental life.<br />
A sense of self is not fully present until these capacities have developed.<br />
Play is now seen as necessary for creative engagement throughout life.<br />
For these developments to occur, the infant depends upon a responsive environment,<br />
&#xa0;where there is interactive play between infant and carer.<br />
This is a situation which generates a particular kind of pleasure that neither could gain alone.<br />
It is these relationships that help generate personality and social character.<br />
<br />
In situations of trauma there can be a deficit in this type of relationship<br />
&#xa0;that means that the individual doesn't have the opportunity<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;to gain a sense of his or her own value and capacities in relation to others.<br />
Psychotherapy seeks to use this model of affective development, emotional development,<br />
&#xa0;to provide a containing and responsive relationship<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;where the patient can be recognized, validated, and responded to.<br />
In doing this, the therapist will bring something new into the relationship,<br />
&#xa0;something from the therapist's self.<br />
This process of working with what is given by the patient and contributing something new<br />
&#xa0;is a strategy that actively promotes the growth of a healthy self.<br />
A person can then develop the ability<br />
&#xa0;to integrate difficult experiences into an overall affirming narrative and life experience.<br />
We seek to reestablish the zone of proximal development.<br />

3-1 2 创造性的自我<br />
</p>

<p>
心理健康依赖于与环境的持续更新关系。<br />
作为社会性动物，人类的福祉依赖于与他人的沟通和关系。<br />
个体的心智依赖于通过语言的沟通，利用符号来理解和参与世界。<br />
</p>

<p>
从生命的起点开始，人类就具备了沟通的能力。<br />
婴儿能够哭泣来表达其他情感，能够轮流互动，并能随着对话的节奏和音调作出音乐性反应。<br />
他们通过与父母或看护者的互动进行这一切，他们与父母或看护者通过沟通和游戏建立关系。<br />
这是一个让婴儿通过他人的环境作为成长手段的过程。<br />
人类基因组为每个个体提供了许多潜能，但需要与一个足够响应的看护者环境互动。<br />
通过这种方式，婴儿可以发展出允许他或她成为人类社会中完全参与者的能力。<br />
</p>

<p>
与其他物种相比，人类婴儿高度依赖成年人。<br />
他们需要许多年才能发展出照顾自己的技能。<br />
婴儿出生时并没有自我意识。<br />
这种意识随着时间的推移而发展，成为我们第二天性的一部分。<br />
它依赖于早期的学习。<br />
自我意识通过沟通和探索中的体验产生。<br />
这些心理生活的方面需要时间才能确立。<br />
</p>

<p>
自我意识是一个积极的成就，反映了个体对自身价值的认知。<br />
积极和消极的情感需要通过早期的关系以不同的方式来处理。<br />
这些关系一方面安抚困扰，另一方面增强婴儿的生命感。<br />
这有助于婴儿的价值感的建立，为从他人那里学习提供了空间，这被称为近距离发展区。<br />
</p>

<p>
出生时，我们被抛入人类的世界，一个人在这个复杂关系网络中有一席之地，而这些关系对每个个体都有重要意义。<br />
人类像所有其他物种一样，存在于物质世界中，但人类的独特之处在于我们也存在于象征性的领域中。<br />
也就是说，人类在语言的世界和物质的世界中共同成长。<br />
从一开始，他们就能够在情感和身体上参与其中。<br />
情感是所有人类体验的一部分，充当了内建的价值系统，帮助婴儿和成人评估他们的体验，选择那些促进生命感和成长的互动。<br />
这可以被描述为利用直觉、感觉或本能。<br />
每个人在与他人和更广泛环境互动时产生的情感类型，逐渐成为个体的特征。<br />
</p>

<p>
在过去几十年中，研究重新审视了情感在心理生活中的角色。<br />
生命感对心理健康和心理生活的发展至关重要。<br />
所有活生生的生物都寻求探索环境，以寻找他们生存和繁荣所需的东西。<br />
这种倾向被称为寻求系统。<br />
它是一个天生的能力，对于人类来说，扩展到关系和象征性的生活方面。<br />
这为人类生活中的联系渴望和寻找意义提供了基础。<br />
这也意味着，健康的心理生活的很大一部分面向未来。<br />
</p>

<p>
意义感不是固定的或外部的，而是通过沟通、关系和技能的建立创造出来的。<br />
现实通过他人在交流中的认可和回应来确认，也就是说，通过对话。<br />
这就是为什么人们寻求心理困扰帮助的原因之一。<br />
他们有通过安全和认可的关系重新找到自身定位的需求。<br />
自我意识可能会因创伤、压力或疾病而变得紊乱。<br />
而治疗关系则是恢复自我的必要条件。<br />
</p>

<p>
很长一段时间，游戏被视为儿童的事。<br />
这一观点在最近几十年发生了变化。<br />
游戏有两种形式。<br />
身体游戏是与其他哺乳动物共同拥有的，可能对广泛的情感范围和对要求高强度身体活动的紧迫感和自信心的培养至关重要。<br />
另一种典型的人类游戏是象征性游戏，孩子在有着一个可靠的看护者作为安全基地的情况下，会开心地与玩具和其他环境中的物品玩耍，通常一边玩耍一边说话。<br />
这些玩具代表了孩子想象的某些方面，具有象征性的意义，而不仅仅是字面上的价值。<br />
这种游戏帮助孩子发展他们内心世界的强烈意识，从而培养反思能力，并对心智生活产生主权感。<br />
在这些能力发展之前，自我意识并未完全形成。<br />
如今，游戏被视为一生中创造性参与的必要条件。<br />
为了实现这些发展，婴儿依赖于一个有反应的环境，其中婴儿和看护者之间有互动性的游戏。<br />
这是一个产生特定类型愉悦的情境，单独一方无法获得这种愉悦。<br />
正是这些关系有助于塑造个性和社会性格。<br />
</p>

<p>
在创伤的情境中，这种类型的关系可能会出现缺失，导致个体没有机会在与他人的关系中获得自己的价值和能力的认同。<br />
心理治疗旨在利用这种情感发展模型，提供一个包容和反应的关系，在这种关系中，患者可以得到认同、验证和回应。<br />
在此过程中，治疗师将带入一些新的东西，来自治疗师自身的东西。<br />
这种与患者给予的内容合作并贡献新东西的过程，是一种积极促进健康自我成长的策略。<br />
这样，个体可以发展出将困难的经历整合到一个肯定的叙事和生命体验中的能力。<br />
我们寻求重新建立近距离发展区。<br />
