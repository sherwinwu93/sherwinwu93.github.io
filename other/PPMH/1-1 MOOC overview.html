Welcome to the Positive Psychiatry online course<br />
&#xa0;created by the Education Department at the Brain and Mind Center, University of Sydney.<br />
We are a team of three psychiatrists<br />
&#xa0;who are passionate about community education as a means of empowerment.<br />
That is Associate Professor Louise Nash, Associate Professor Loyola McLean, and myself.<br />
We have brought together a large number of Australia's leading experts<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;from psychiatry, psychology, and mental health research,<br />
&#xa0;to share their ideas.<br />
We'll also hear from experts by experience - people<br />
&#xa0;who have lived with mental illness and share their stories of personal recovery.<br />
<br />
Good mental health is about feeling good and functioning well.<br />
And positive psychiatry is about building strength as well as fixing problems.<br />
The course will also cover the fundamentals of mental illness<br />
&#xa0;and practical strategies for staying strong and enhancing well-being.<br />
The course is organized into five modules, each designed to be covered in one week.<br />
<br />
In the first module, we meet Tina,<br />
&#xa0;a lived experience and recovery expert who tells the first part of her story.<br />
This module will cover positive mental health, stress, and resilience,<br />
&#xa0;and some of the important findings from Aristotle<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;through to recent research on the correlates of happiness.<br />
<br />
The second module is about the body and mind.<br />
We will learn about the central importance of physical health and lifestyle,<br />
&#xa0;and how exercise can be used as an evidence-based treatment for common mental health conditions.<br />
We will cover basic relaxation and mindfulness strategies,<br />
&#xa0;as well as personality strengths and how to identify your own strengths.<br />
<br />
In the third module we talk about love and work,<br />
&#xa0;and introduce the complementary ideas of rest and play.<br />
We will hear about attachment theory, social connections,<br />
&#xa0;and the ancient wisdom of Australian Aboriginal views on well-being.<br />
We discuss the importance of contributing,<br />
&#xa0;and here you will find out whether or not work is good for you.<br />
<br />
In the fourth module, we cover the major categories of mental illness;<br />
&#xa0;their symptoms, causes, and treatments.<br />
This includes the more common conditions such as anxiety, depression, and addictions,<br />
&#xa0;as well as less common mental illness such as psychosis, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder.<br />
<br />
Our fifth and final module in this course will detail some of the many paths to recovery.<br />
From early intervention through the philosophy of personal recovery, consumer support networks,<br />
&#xa0;creative arts as therapy, as well as spiritual and religious practices.<br />
<br />
Within each module there will be many lectures and links to recommended readings.<br />
There will be self-assessment questionnaires<br />
&#xa0;and practical homework tasks including SMART goal setting.<br />
Assessments include quizzes and peer marked short answer questions.<br />
<br />
So join us for the next five weeks on a shared journey of learning towards better mental health<br />
&#xa0;and better understanding of this fundamental aspect of our well-being.<br />

我们还将听取“经验专家”的声音——那些曾经历精神疾病并分享个人康复故事的人。<br />

<p>
第三模块涉及爱与工作，并引入“休息与娱乐”这两个互补概念。<br />
