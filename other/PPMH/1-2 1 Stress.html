<p class="verse">
Stress, stress, stress.<br />
We seem to read about stress everywhere,<br />
&#xa0;and more and more, it's seen as a factor in our health, affecting body, mind, and brain.<br />
So in this talk, we're going to spend a little time on stress,<br />
&#xa0;its positive and more difficult sides, and what to do to tame it.<br />
This will dovetail with a lot of the other talks on our MOOC<br />
&#xa0;because stress is one of the newer kids on the block,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and we need to know a lot about it to promote our well-being and flourishing.<br />
<br />
The whole idea comes out of notions from last century,<br />
&#xa0;that human beings, like other animals,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;like to operate within a comfortable zone a lot of the time.<br />
Nowadays, we call that our window of tolerance.<br />
We don't mind getting towards the edge of the zone for a little while.<br />
For example, we can enjoy getting excited, a little anxious, a little angry, or a little scared,<br />
&#xa0;if it's in a good and safe enough cause.<br />
Most people might enjoy something like getting excited about the outcome of the footy match,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that's what Australian's call football, or in a ball game,<br />
&#xa0;and getting terrified in a safe way, by the ride on, say, a roller coaster.<br />
However, part of our eagerness to do these things<br />
&#xa0;is we know that they're mostly safe for the majority.<br />
And the feelings and body sensations will settle safely,<br />
&#xa0;and we will feel back to normal<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;some time not too long after the game, or the big day out at the amusement park.<br />
<br />
When we get out of our comfort zone,<br />
&#xa0;the stress begins to dramatically rise, and then we find situations distressing.<br />
We can notice changes in our body<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;like pulse rate rising uncomfortably, blood pressure escalating,<br />
&#xa0;or we feel distressing levels of emotion.<br />
At even more extreme levels,<br />
&#xa0;we can begin to feel frozen or trapped, or even disconnect or dissociate.<br />
Then, we need to use ways to calm back down and feel more comfortable.<br />
Most of us do this best<br />
&#xa0;by using soothing from others and ways we've learnt through life to calm down.<br />
<br />
After particularly stressful events or periods,<br />
&#xa0;we may even need a solid period of rest and recovery.<br />
We don't always make time for that in our busy modern lives.<br />
Positive psychiatry talks about using ways to settle that promote our well-being and don't hurt us.<br />
So, using our connecting conversations with others,<br />
&#xa0;good exercise, that mindfulness, meditation, breathing to calm down,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;rather than drugs or alcohol, just as an example.<br />
When we can't manage the high stress,<br />
&#xa0;it can begin to do damage to our well-being and become traumatic,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;meaning that our normal coping is overwhelmed.<br />
The good news is that even here we can often recover,<br />
&#xa0;and often become more resilient in the process.<br />
At other times, cumulative or overwhelming stress is traumatic.<br />
And then we need strong pathways to recovery, and what's called post-traumatic growth.<br />
That's where we grow as a result of difficult circumstances.<br />
<br />
Just to be clear, stress is not just all in the mind.<br />
Our bodies really feel it.<br />
And too much stress can contribute to many illnesses in times when mental health breaks down.<br />
Stress triggers inflammation for example,<br />
&#xa0;and cumulative stress can literally become disorganizing for our mental and physical life.<br />
So, learning to manage it becomes a keystone of our well being and health.<br />
<br />
Stress regulation and stress management<br />
&#xa0;are essential part of positive psychology and positive psychiatry.<br />
Today, we think of it as a hierarchy of stress management at the top of those strategies<br />
&#xa0;that really help us connect to ourselves and others.<br />
And help our brains, bodies, minds reconnect, and be restored and nourished after stress.<br />
Stephen Porges, a psychiatrist in the US,<br />
&#xa0;has been describing that we have a social nervous system,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;evolved to manage stress best via our social connections.<br />
So at the top of the hierarchy for managing stress are the ways<br />
&#xa0;we connect and calm and soothe each other in relationships and connective conversations.<br />
Our facial expression, and our capacities to speak and use body language,<br />
&#xa0;have actually developed in evolution to help this process.<br />
For example, we really value and feel better<br />
&#xa0;when somebody shows, by expression and gesture, that they get us and what we're talking about.<br />
We begin to calm down.<br />
We feel really good after a shared laugh or occasionally a shared cry,<br />
&#xa0;and the sharing is the connecting<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that actually nourishes a part of our nervous system called the parasympathetic nervous system.<br />
<br />
We hear a lot about the sympathetic nervous system, the so-called fight and flight system.<br />
And people have known for a long time<br />
&#xa0;that the sympathetic nervous system connects with our immediate response to high stress,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and we see it at work in the innovation of heart and blood vessels.<br />
It makes our pulse rate and our blood pressure go up like the accelerated pedal of a car.<br />
<br />
However, our rest and digest and restore system is the parasympathetic system.<br />
It works in our gut and our digestive system.<br />
It has connections like a brake to our heart.<br />
It powers up all of those muscles of facial expression that we were just talking about.<br />
So the social soothing comes from parasympathetic input.<br />
Some of it's from fast-talking nerves covered in a substance called myelin.<br />
And they connect upwards to the most important conscious thinking parts of our brain,<br />
&#xa0;and to many systems.<br />
<br />
However, we also have parasympathetic input<br />
&#xa0;from an older nervous system with fibers that are unmyelinated.<br />
They move slower but deeper, and are responsible for some of those deep feelings in our middle<br />
&#xa0;when we are stressed and distressed.<br />
The terrible deep feeling of grief, for example.<br />
When stress really overwhelms us, we can get in to that older parasympathetic state of withdrawal,<br />
&#xa0;when the older parasympathetic system is dominating.<br />
In that state, we need to slow down, take it easy, warm up.<br />
Sometimes literally, sometimes emotionally.<br />
Take time, get good care to recover.<br />
After a period of more active symptoms of illness for example, whether mental or general medical,<br />
&#xa0;some people find they have a period of deep fatigue<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;where they need to take things more slowly to restore energy<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;and come back to their normal selves.<br />
<br />
These days then, with a little science to back up the art of relaxation and stress relief,<br />
&#xa0;we encourage people to find the ways to calm down<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and to find stress and stress management strategies that work for them.<br />
Meditation and mindfulness are powerfully effective,<br />
&#xa0;and they seem to offer a space to connect to ourselves,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and literally help us to connect our body, brain, mind.<br />
However, do take lots of social soothing.<br />
Don't be afraid to get fit and busy, for example, with exercise,<br />
&#xa0;which uses the sympathetic system wisely.<br />
But also watch when the older, deeper system, your gut,<br />
&#xa0;is telling you that you're very tired or overwhelmed,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and need to slow down and really rest and restore in quiet ways.<br />
Hopefully you're going to tune in to other talks<br />
&#xa0;which cover stress management through great strategies<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;like relaxation, mindfulness, exercise, creativity, and play.<br />
I love to use many of them.<br />
Find what works for you and use them daily,<br />
&#xa0;and help your kids and those you care for to find their favorite ways.<br />
So, as we learn to surf our stress, we get stronger.<br />
Flexibility fosters resilience and highly connected minds and bodies, and our flourishing.<br />

1-2 1 压力<br />
</p>

<p>
压力，压力，压力。<br />
我们似乎在任何地方都能看到关于压力的讨论，而且越来越多的研究表明，它是影响我们健康的重要因素，会影响我们的身体、思维和大脑。<br />
因此，在本次讲座中，我们将花些时间来探讨压力，它的积极和困难的一面，以及如何驯服它。<br />
这与我们的 MOOC 课程中的许多其他讲座相呼应，因为压力是近年来才受到广泛关注的领域，而我们需要深入了解它，以促进我们的幸福和成长。<br />
这个概念源自上个世纪的理论，即人类与其他动物一样，大多数时候都喜欢在一个舒适的区域内运作。<br />
如今，我们称之为“耐受窗口”。<br />
我们并不介意在这个区域的边缘徘徊一会儿。<br />
例如，如果有一个合理且足够安全的理由，我们可能会享受兴奋、轻微焦虑、愤怒或害怕的感觉。<br />
大多数人可能会喜欢因足球比赛的结果而激动不已——澳大利亚人称之为“footy”，或者在球类比赛中感受到紧张的刺激。<br />
此外，我们也会喜欢安全地体验恐惧，比如乘坐过山车。<br />
然而，我们愿意做这些事情的部分原因在于，我们知道对大多数人来说，它们是相对安全的。<br />
而且，这些情绪和身体感觉会逐渐恢复平稳，我们会在比赛结束后或在游乐园玩耍一天之后不久，回归正常状态。<br />
当我们超出舒适区时，压力就会急剧上升，我们会发现某些情况令人痛苦。<br />
我们可能会注意到身体的变化，比如心跳加快到不适的程度、血压升高，或者经历强烈的情绪困扰。<br />
在更极端的情况下，我们可能会感到僵住、被困住，甚至产生脱离现实或解离的感觉。<br />
此时，我们需要采取方法让自己平静下来，重新感到舒适。<br />
大多数人最有效的做法是依靠他人的安抚，以及我们在生活中学到的各种自我调节的方法。<br />
在经历特别紧张的事件或时期后，我们甚至可能需要一段时间的充分休息和恢复。<br />
然而，在忙碌的现代生活中，我们并不总是腾出时间来休养生息。<br />
积极精神病学提倡使用不会伤害我们、但有助于恢复的方式来平复压力。<br />
例如，我们可以通过与他人的交流、适量的运动、正念冥想、深呼吸等方式来放松自己，而不是依赖酒精或药物。<br />
当我们无法管理高强度的压力时，它可能会对我们的幸福造成损害，甚至变成创伤，意味着我们的正常应对能力被压垮了。<br />
不过，值得庆幸的是，即使在这种情况下，我们通常也能恢复，甚至在这个过程中变得更加坚韧。<br />
然而，有时，长期积累或极端的压力会带来创伤。<br />
这时，我们需要强有力的恢复路径，以及所谓的“创伤后成长”。<br />
这意味着我们可以在艰难的环境中成长和进步。<br />
需要明确的是，压力不仅仅存在于我们的思想中，我们的身体同样会真实地感受到它。<br />
过度的压力可能会导致许多疾病，并在精神健康崩溃时雪上加霜。<br />
例如，压力会触发炎症，而长期积累的压力甚至会让我们的身心变得紊乱。<br />
因此，学会管理压力是我们健康和幸福的关键。<br />
压力调节和压力管理是积极心理学和积极精神病学的重要组成部分。<br />
如今，我们将压力管理视为一个分层的体系，而最顶层的策略是那些能够帮助我们与自己和他人建立联系，并让我们的身体、大脑和心灵在压力后恢复和滋养的方法。<br />
美国精神病学家斯蒂芬·波尔吉斯提出，我们拥有一个“社会神经系统”，它是进化而来的，最有效的压力管理方式正是通过社交连接来实现。<br />
因此，在压力管理的最高层，我们最需要的是人与人之间的互动，比如在关系中相互安慰、进行深入的沟通。<br />
我们的面部表情、语言表达能力以及肢体语言，实际上是在进化过程中发展出来的，用于帮助这一过程。<br />
例如，当别人通过表情和手势表达出他们理解我们、并明白我们所讲的内容时，我们会感到放松下来。<br />
我们会发现，和他人一起开怀大笑，或者偶尔一起流泪，会让我们感觉更好。<br />
这种共享的情感交流实际上会滋养我们的副交感神经系统。<br />
我们经常听到交感神经系统，也就是所谓的“战斗或逃跑”系统。<br />
人们早已知道交感神经系统会在高度压力下被激活，它与我们的心脏和血管系统密切相关，让心跳加快、血压上升，就像汽车的油门踏板一样。<br />
然而，我们的“休息、消化和恢复”系统是副交感神经系统。<br />
它控制着消化系统，并通过类似刹车的机制调节心脏活动，同时也作用于我们面部表情的肌肉。<br />
因此，社会安慰主要依赖于副交感神经系统的输入。<br />
部分副交感神经系统通过覆盖有髓鞘的神经快速传递信号，它们向上传导到我们大脑中最重要的意识思维区域，并与多个系统相连接。<br />
然而，我们还有一个更古老的副交感神经系统，其中的神经纤维是无髓鞘的，传导速度较慢但作用更深远。<br />
它们负责我们在压力和痛苦时产生的深层情感，例如深深的悲伤感。<br />
当压力真正压倒我们时，我们可能会进入这种更古老的副交感神经系统主导的撤退状态。<br />
在这种状态下，我们需要慢下来，放松自己，并让身体变暖。<br />
有时是字面意义上的温暖，有时是情感上的温暖。<br />
我们需要花时间，接受良好的照顾，来恢复身心健康。<br />
例如，在经历了一段时间的疾病（无论是心理上的还是生理上的）后，有些人会经历深度疲劳的阶段。<br />
他们需要放慢节奏，以恢复能量，并重新回到正常状态。<br />
如今，科学研究为放松和压力缓解提供了支持，我们鼓励人们找到适合自己的方法来放松，并制定有效的压力管理策略。<br />
冥想和正念练习被证明非常有效，它们能帮助我们与自己建立联系，并在身体、大脑和心灵之间建立连接。<br />
然而，我们也应该多依靠社交互动带来的安慰。<br />
不要害怕通过运动来增强体能并保持忙碌，因为运动可以合理地利用交感神经系统。<br />
但同时，也要倾听自己身体的信号，特别是当你的肠道感觉到极度疲惫或不堪重负时。<br />
这时，你需要放慢节奏，真正地休息，并以安静的方式恢复能量。<br />
希望你能继续关注其他讲座，它们会介绍许多压力管理策略，比如放松、正念、运动、创造力和游戏。<br />
我个人喜欢使用这些方法中的许多种。<br />
找到适合自己的方法，并每天坚持使用它们。<br />
同时，也帮助你的孩子和你关心的人找到他们喜欢的减压方式。<br />
因此，当我们学会驾驭压力时，我们会变得更强大。<br />
灵活性可以促进韧性，让我们的身心更加紧密地连接，并帮助我们茁壮成长。<br />
