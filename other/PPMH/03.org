[MUSIC] When you think about
your own mental health, what really makes you mentally healthy,
there are two big, kind of individual psychological
concepts or social concepts running. One is,
"I need to be in control of my own life." If you're not in control of your own life,
people telling you what to do all the time because you have very little freedom,
either individually or because you exist in a very rigid social system, then you
don't tend to be very mentally healthy. People need to be able to make
decisions about their own life. That's the concept of autonomy. Now it's not actually the same
as individuality [LAUGH]. It's not actually about,
it's just about me. So the other really interesting concept
is one of, actually, connection. To be really mentally healthy, you need
to be strongly and socially connected. Real humans exist in real social groups, small world networks,
to be highly connected, both with their parents,
their children, their friends, their family, their workplace, the people
they live close to, highly embedded. Humans are social animals that
exist in small social groups, and they thrive together. They die alone, they thrive together. So mental health depends on these two, often thought of as conflicting
ideas of autonomy and connection. They're not actually conflicted. You need to be able to make
decisions about yourself, but also be part of a social group. They're quite different to individuality,
"It's just about me", and what goes with that,
which is disconnection. And both of those are associated
with poor mental health. So good mental health, autonomous,
in societies that allow people, women, children, migrants, old people, to
thrive and not be discriminated against, but, also, encourage people to stay
strongly connected in their communities. Not just to care about myself and
the person I'm directly related to, but the wider group of people
I interact with every day. [MUSIC]
