[MUSIC] What is it that makes you feel
really well in the world? That you're functioning really well. Because that requires a combination
of your cognitive function, your emotional state, your physiology. And then how you're interacting
in fact with your family, your employment situation,
your local community. And how that all comes
together if it's working well. If it's all working in synchrony,
to give you a strong sense of well being, that your life is really worthwhile. And people who have that
are very productive. They contribute a great deal
to their community, and they draw a great deal
of pleasure from that. So well being has gone on to become quite
a complex notion of what's happening internally. How I am, how I'm functioning within
the community that I work in, and then how productive I am, economically and
socially within that particular issue. Not longer sort of really fuzzy concept,
just a kind of idea, that's kind of nice. But a much more hard edged idea is
something we need to understand better. How do all those things come together
to create a state of well being, in which humans are then
at their most productive? [MUSIC]
