* public speaking
#+begin_verse
If you feel nervous about giving a speech, you are in very good company.
Some of the greatest public speakers in history have suffered from stage fright,
	including Abraham Lincoln, Margaret Sanger, and Winston Churchill.
The famous Roman orator Cicero said,
	"I turn pale at the outset of a speech and quake in every limb and in my soul."
	
Jennifer Lawrence, Conan O'Brien,
	and Oprah Winfrey all report being anxious about speaking in public.
Early in his career, Leonardo DiCaprio was so nervous about giving an acceptance speech
	that he hoped he would not win the Academy Award for which he had been nominated.
Eighty-one percent of business executives say
	public speaking is the most nerve-wracking experience they face.
What comedian Jerry Seinfeld said in jest sometimes seems literally true:
	"Given a choice, at a funeral most of us would rather be the one in the coffin
		than the one giving the eulogy."
