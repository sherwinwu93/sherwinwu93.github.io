bones

"I want to drive a snow plow
	so I've been watching a lot of YouTube videos about construction vehicles.
Construction vehicles are built a lot like people.
The steel is like the bones and if you look at a bulldozer,
	it looks like it has shoulders and elbows and wrists."

"He's the top of his class in math, and second in reading.
It's a challenge to let him mature at a pace I wanted to versus the pace he wants to.
We're having to learn that even if you have a good response, it can sometimes be best to just listen."
