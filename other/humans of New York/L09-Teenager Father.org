* L09 Teenager Father

"My father never grew up. He was always in and out of jail.
And if you listen to him talk, he acts like he was some sort of kingpin, but he wasn't.
It's like he's still a teenager in his head.

He even uses the same words as 30 years ago.
He say things like: 'When I was back in my groove, ain't nobody used to tell me nothing.'
And he can't accept responsibility for anything.
He says things like, If my family treated me better, I wouldn't have to do drugs."
