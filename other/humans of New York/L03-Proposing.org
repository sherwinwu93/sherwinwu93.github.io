* L03 Proposing
romantic proposing

"We took a ten day trip to the Dominican Republic,
	and my plan was to propose at the very end.
I'd already called her parents and everything, so I couldn't come home without proposing.
On the day we were scheduled to go back home,
	we took one last romantic walk on the beach, right at sunrise.
Everything was lining up perfectly.

I led her to the most secluded spot I could find.
There was only one other couple on the beach.
Then right before I proposed,
	the one other guy on the beach got on one knee
	and started proposing to his girlfriend."
