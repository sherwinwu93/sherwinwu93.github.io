Brokeback Mountain

"When I was fourteen, I had a friend over to my house
	and we were sitting on the floor of my closest making jewelry.
My mom poked her head in the room and asked us what movie we wanted to see that night,
	and we said 'Brokeback Mountain.'
She said we were a little too young for that, suggested an animated movie instead.
My friend started laughing at my mom and calling her lame.
I joined in, even though I actually really liked animated movies.
When my mom came back with the showtimes for Brokeback Mountain,
	I noticed that she was sniffling and her eyes were red.
We saw Brokeback Mountain that night,
	but I've never wanted to watch it again."
