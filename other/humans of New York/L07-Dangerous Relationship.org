* L07 Dangerous Relationship
Why is it a dangerous relationship?

"We were dating for three or four years, off and on.
I decided that I didn't want a serious relationship,
	but every time I tried to break up with her,
	she'd threaten to kill herself.
Like if I didn't answer her text messages for a few days,
	she'd send me a video of her swallowing a bunch of pills,
	the later she'd tell me that she threw them all up.
I was at a business meeting one night
	- it turned out to be a pyramid scheme,
		but I didn't know it at the time
		- and she started sending me text messages again,
			saying she was going to hurt herself.
It was like the fifth time she'd done it,
	so I didn't even answer.
That night she hung herself with a dog leash."
