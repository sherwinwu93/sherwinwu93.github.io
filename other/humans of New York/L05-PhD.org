* L05 PhD
"I'm an unemployed single father,
	and I feel like I've been written out of the economy (write sb. out of sth.).
I've got a PhD in Microbiology and Immunology,
	but I can't get a job in teaching, medical writing, or research.
	
They showed us a video in the food stamp office about finding a job.
It showed some guy bagging groceries, and he said something like:
'People assume I'm not smart because I'm bagging groceries,
	but I've got a bachelors degree and some graduate school experience!'
I think they were telling me to lower my expectations.'
