* L10 Don't leave me!!!

"My children are 18, 17 and 15.
And I think it's just really starting to hit me that I'm about to lose them really quickly.
I'm always thinking back
	and trying to figure out the ways that I might have been able to spend more time with them.
Maybe if I'd been a little less concerned with cleaning up messes,
	or always cooking dinner,
	or going through the mail as soon as I got home from work.
	
I don't know... I just wish I'd been less 'busy'.
When I was twenty, I left home and moved away to New York.
I'd go home to visit my mother once a year, and each time she'd look a litte old.
I guess part of me is just afraid that my kids are going to do the same things to me.
