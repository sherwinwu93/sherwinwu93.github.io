* L06 Please be sober

"I lost my daughter because of my drinking.
I've been sober for five years, but I was always drunk when she was growing up.
At school events when all her friends had their parents with them,
	she was always having to explain why her dad wasn't there.
It was embarrassing for her.
She told me that I ruined her life."
"When's the last time you talked to her?"
"I texted her on her birthday.
She texted me on mine.
But then she got a new phone.
I left her mother a message, asking for the number.
But I never heard back."
