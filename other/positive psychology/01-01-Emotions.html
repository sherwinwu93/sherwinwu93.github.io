Welcome to positive psychology.<br />
I'm so glad you're here.<br />
You know one of the key founders of the positive psychology movement, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi,<br />
&#xa0;tells us that,<br />
&#xa0;to live a good life it's not enough to remove what is wrong with it,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and positive psychology is two things at once.<br />
First and foremost it's an active area of science.<br />
That investigates, those positive things that we need to add to our lives to make them good.<br />
Yet in addition, it's a movement, a dynamic force, the world over.<br />
And I'm captivated by the image of you out there,<br />
&#xa0;being able to take your curiosity about positive psychology to the next level.<br />
Just by taking this course, you'll gain skills to make a positive difference,<br />
&#xa0;not only in your own life, but also in the lives of others in your community.<br />
Now imagine the positive ripples that radiate out from your efforts here.<br />
And now imagine those positive ripples multiplied by thousands or tens of thousands.<br />
You are part of something much larger here.<br />
That's the positive psychology movement and you're right at the center of it.<br />
Now I see the broad reach of this movement first hand,<br />
&#xa0;having been elected President of the International Positive Psychology Association.<br />
Members of IPPA as we call it, hail from more than 70 countries<br />
&#xa0;and includes scientists and practitioners.<br />
Alongside students and anyone else in an abiding interest, in positive psychology.<br />
In fact, IPPA can help you maintain your connection to the positive psychology community,<br />
&#xa0;long after you've completed this course.<br />
Now speaking of community, you'll notice that I teach this online course, as a small seminar<br />
&#xa0;and that you'll be taking it alongside four in video classmates, Brett, Kelly, Patrick, and Debby.<br />
Now I chose this format for two reasons.<br />
First, each of these people has a unique perspective on positive psychology,<br />
&#xa0;that I know you'll benefit from hearing.<br />
Second, I think learning happens best through dialogue and sharing ideas.<br />
And this small seminar format, allows this exchange in the videos themselves.<br />
Also, from time to time in these videos, you'll see tiny yellow lines, bisect the timeline.<br />
At each of those moments, and there's one coming up soon.<br />
I'll pause the action, to give you a moment to reflect, or answer a quick question.<br />
Doing so will heighten your engagement with positive psychology, so don't miss out.<br />
And you know<br />
&#xa0;scientific studies show<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that whenever you shift, from passively absorbing course material to actively engaging with it,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;your learning accelerates.<br />
So welcome to week one.<br />
Let's begin.<br />
<br />
Thanks so much for being here, everybody.<br />
This is going to be a, a fun way to learn positive psychology together.<br />
Before we get into it, I want to take a moment just to lay the playing field and get introductions.<br />
<br />
I'm Barb Fredrickson.<br />
I've been studying positive psychology even before there was positive psychology.<br />
And, over the course of the weeks that we're together here we'll be diving into a lot of that more.<br />
So, I'm going to just stay short with that.<br />
But I'd, love to hear from each of you guys what draws you to positive psych<br />
&#xa0;what do you hope to do with it?<br />
So just take a moment and we'll introduce ourselves.<br />
<br />
My name is Debbie, I am a professor here and also an administrator<br />
&#xa0;and I think I'm blending my world's of athletics and business.<br />
And so I apply positive psychology in everything that I do,<br />
&#xa0;from competition, to coaching, to inspiring others,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and certainly in the classroom working with young people.<br />
Having to stay positive, and help that tender age of 17 to 25.<br />
<br />
And I'm Patrick.<br />
I'm a professor here at UNC.<br />
And teach in our school of education.<br />
So, prepare teachers councilors, and principals.<br />
I'm interested<br />
&#xa0;because, when I was a councilor with middle school kids, when we talked about something positive,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;they really responded.<br />
Versus the problems they were having.<br />
And so now I prepare counselors that way<br />
&#xa0;and study hope and some other things around positive psych.<br />
Great. Kelly?<br />
<br />
My name's Kelly, and I have a degree in psychology<br />
&#xa0;and then I went back to school to get certified as a holistic health coach.<br />
I work with people who want to live more fully and deeply.<br />
And I offer coaching to improve their health on any number of levels in mind, body, and spirit.<br />
I'm especially excited about applying positive psychology to people who have chronic illness,<br />
&#xa0;based on my own experience with that.<br />
<br />
And I'm Brett and I'm a phd student here at Carolina<br />
&#xa0;and I research positive emotions and try to use science, to help us understand<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;how positive emotions shape our health and our social relationships with others and<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;how we can utilize positive emotions.<br />
In, in our everyday lives.<br />
<br />
Great.<br />
I am so grateful that you're all here, joining me with in this course.<br />
Because your perspectives are going to mean so much to the other people who take this course,<br />
&#xa0;and through other means, so, thanks a lot.<br />
I'm really grateful.<br />
So I really love to refer back to Chris Peterson,<br />
&#xa0;a good friend of mine who has been a leader in positive psychology.<br />
He used to say positive psychology is not a spectator's sport.<br />
That, you have to dive right in and experience it,<br />
&#xa0;because otherwise it's just a bunch of abstract ideas.<br />
So we, I want to start us off by getting us familiar with the concepts of emotion.<br />
So I want you to have an emotion. Right now.<br />
So you know, and we're going to start off with the bad.<br />
I want you to think of relive a negative emotional experience.<br />
Maybe something that was so frustrating that, you know, just made you want to explode.<br />
And just take a moment to relive that in your mind.<br />
Think about where you were,<br />
&#xa0;who you were with,<br />
&#xa0;what had just happened<br />
&#xa0;and as you begin to relive that in your mind,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;just notice whether you can make it grow for just a second of two.<br />
And then, take a moment to reflect on what, what stands out, in that experience.<br />
How does reliving this, make your body feel.<br />
How d, what does it make your face feel like?<br />
What thoughts come to mind?<br />
What does it, what does it make you want to do?<br />
<br />
My first thought is to reject it.<br />
Yeah. I don't want to go back there, and so I'm getting rigid, and heart starts racing.<br />
Right. Yeah. Right.<br />
It's uncomfortable.<br />
Right, so, with any emotional experience,<br />
&#xa0;we, they either fit with or against what we want<br />
&#xa0;and so a big part of emotion experience is that is this wanted or unwanted.<br />
Mm-hm,.<br />
And so there's often a you know, either a embrace it,<br />
&#xa0;I want to feel this way or you know I don't want to feel this way,<br />
&#xa0;so that, great example of just that you know responses to emotion are a big part of emotion.<br />
You can't, you can't have an emotion without having a response to emotion at the same time.<br />
Anyone else?<br />
<br />
I wanted to echo something<br />
&#xa0;that you mentioned in that when I think about something that negative emotion.<br />
You said your heart started racing<br />
&#xa0;and I, I have, I experience that too both in the moment<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;when I'm experiencing it but even when I'm thinking about it.<br />
Again, sometimes, you know, you can feel your, your heart racing, and kind of tense up.<br />
And it's, like it's a very full body type of feeling.<br />
<br />
Right, right.<br />
One of the things that's so true of emotions is<br />
&#xa0;it's not, emotions aren't something that just sit up in your head.<br />
Roll around in your skull.<br />
They are embodied.<br />
And there's no emotion that isn't embodied<br />
&#xa0;so it, it's going to affect of th, what happens in your heart.<br />
It's going to affect your muscle tension.<br />
It's going to you know, certainly affect aspects of how you carry yourself, even, so.<br />
Anyone else want to join in?<br />
<br />
I just, my, my reaction a little bit is I want to move on,<br />
&#xa0;so it's a little bit hard for me to come<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and, you know, process that negative thing.<br />
Yeah.<br />
I always try to be future-focused so if, you know, I try to move from that.<br />
So it's hard for me to go back and do that reflection on negative stuff.<br />
<br />
Right.<br />
So again, I, I think there's a real way<br />
&#xa0;in which individual differences come into play here a lot,<br />
&#xa0;whereas, you know some people can't move on from the negative<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and then some people you know, want to move past them really quickly.<br />
Again, so again, you're kind of preferences<br />
&#xa0;and home way of being with emotions kind of shows up right away.<br />
Yeah.<br />
One of the things that I wanted to just point out is there's a typical model.<br />
Of emotion that help us understand sort of what's all happening, in an emotional experience.<br />
I asked you to think about a circumstance that might have made you frustrated.<br />
So, a lot of times, emotions they start as situated experiences.<br />
So, you know, some way in which your current circumstance is good for you or bad for you,<br />
&#xa0;but it's not like there's an automatic connection between a situation<br />
&#xa0;and everybody is going to feel the same way.<br />
How people interpret that situation is the, the place<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that turns an emotion into despair or hope or,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;you know, it kind of, it's,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;it's a major gateway into whether emotions are negative are positive,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;or what flavor of positive<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;or what flavor of negative they'll be.<br />
So that interpretation phase is often called, you know, the, the sense making or the appraisal,<br />
&#xa0;that comes out of it.<br />
<br />
Brett, you mentioned, that, you could definitely feel the changes in,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;in you know, heart rate, or muscle tension,<br />
&#xa0;and so, one of the things I would want to point out is that,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;you know, that's not just a private experience.<br />
I mean, what, what, how are other people going to be able to pick up on that,<br />
&#xa0;you know certainly, your face feels kind of a little bit different.<br />
If you're holding your jaw tight, people can see that.<br />
You know, if you're starting to get like, tense or whatever, people can see that.<br />
This is part of emotions aren't just a private experience.<br />
They are, you know, whether we like it or not, they're broadcast.<br />
Their broadcast out so, those bodily changes show up in posture.<br />
They show up in the tone of our voice.<br />
The show up, you know, in you know,<br />
&#xa0;what people are picking up from our smiles or our frowns or scowls.<br />
You know, so and then this last piece Debby, you started with that.<br />
<br />
That of responses to emotions like oh, you know, do I want to, do I want to go there?<br />
Would I, do I want to hold, hold back.<br />
One thing that's I, I really want to emphasize is these responses to emotion are no small thing.<br />
I mean they you can respond to a situation by, you know, like oh I don't want to feel this way.<br />
I don't want to show anybody what I'm feeling.<br />
You know I'm going to try to be kind of stone-faced about it.<br />
So one response would be to try to modify or clamp down on what you were feeling.<br />
Another response would be like, oh, I want to think about this situation differently.<br />
You know, you might think, you first come across something kind of scary.<br />
Maybe going to a transition to high school.<br />
You know, your, your example.<br />
And then you can reframe it.<br />
Oh, it's an opportunity to make new friends.<br />
Or, you know, something.<br />
Some kind of a, one response could be to, I don't want to feel this way,<br />
&#xa0;let me think about it differently.<br />
Another response is to go and change the situation,<br />
&#xa0;you know, like this is a great situation.<br />
I want to, you know, these people are kind of at odds with each other.<br />
I want to bring them together or something like that.<br />
So these, responses to emotion create this, like, dynamic change over time.<br />
So it's sometimes people take emotions, just to be that feeling state,<br />
&#xa0;like, oh, I feel happy, or I feel irritated,<br />
&#xa0;but what we have is so much more in terms of, you know, there's the embodied.<br />
Thoughts and a dynamic change in what, what those are.<br />
So, from a scientific perspective we don't think of emotions as just a feeling state,<br />
&#xa0;it's an embodied feeling state<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that comes with action urges<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that comes with responses<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that get us to change the situation or, or change our, our thoughts.<br />
So, anyway thanks for playing along with going, going to the negative for a moment.<br />
But I appreciate that.<br />
