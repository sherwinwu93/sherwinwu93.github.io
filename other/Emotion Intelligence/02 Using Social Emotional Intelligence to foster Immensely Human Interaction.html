Welcome back.<br />
We're going to tackle the following essential question.<br />
How can knowing more about ourselves help us and learn more about others.<br />
The way we'll open this up<br />
&#xa0;is referencing a really remarkable mid century TV show called The Twilight Zone.<br />
In the opening episode, the very first series,<br />
&#xa0;they tackled this question of what would happen to us<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;when we had to go into space<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;and be separated from other human beings for an extended period of time.<br />
This debuted before people were sent in space.<br />
And it was a very interesting question, one of course, not truly tested in that context.<br />
They basically came to the conclusion in the show<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and unfortunately we know from other experiences and research,<br />
&#xa0;that it is almost insufferable to be disconnected from other human beings.<br />
We have an illusion<br />
&#xa0;that it is possible for us to be completely independent<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and be functional without other people.<br />
As they captured in the episode in the barrier of loneliness,<br />
&#xa0;the palpable desperate need of the human animal to be with his or her fellow humans.<br />
Up there in the vastness of space, in the void,<br />
&#xa0;that is this guy up there is an enemy known as isolation.<br />
And again, the core point of that is isolation is something that is devastating to us.<br />
In our focus in this part, when we talk about connecting with our own emotions,<br />
&#xa0;will help you understand the way in which that can allow us to be more connected about others.<br />
Be more empathetic and build those higher quality connections.<br />
