<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4d9576e">
<p class="verse">
Did you notice all the inappropriate things Cheri did?<br />
I entered the room, another person's meeting, and interrupted their meeting.<br />
I destroyed the meeting's ambiance or environment.<br />
People were shocked.<br />
Did you see their eyes?<br />
I was accusatory.<br />
I was demanding.<br />
I voiced some of the beliefs I had about Jeffrey and teamwork.<br />
What I said can never be erased.<br />
I was haughty and self-indulgent.<br />
I believe that I am better than other people.<br />
I would venture to guess that you are appalled by my behavior.<br />
I am embarrassed every time I watch that!<br />
But Jeffrey also had some issues that I hope you noted.<br />
He didn't stand up for himself.<br />
Perhaps he was afraid.<br />
Perhaps there is fear in this organization.<br />
He and others may not have psychological safety in this company or department.<br />
If that is the case,<br />
&#xa0;then performance will also be lacking or be at a far lower level than it could be.<br />
And everyone around the table is uncomfortable.<br />
They hear Jeffrey's words and feel bad, possibly for Jeffrey, possibly for themselves.<br />
The meeting will never recover from this.<br />
It would be best to cancel the agenda and meet another time.<br />
The behavior of Cheri will always stay in the minds of everyone in that meeting.<br />
Bottom line, it is bad on both sides, Bad Behavior, Bad Culture.<br />
Lack of highly developed social emotional intelligence.<br />
We can all do better.<br />
