Hi.
Welcome to negotiation. I'm Barry Nalebuff. I'm an economics professor at Yale. My specialty is game theory, and
I'll be bringing that toolbox to bear as we explore how you can
be a better negotiator. I hardly need to tell you that
negotiation is important. As Chester Karass writes,
in life you don't get what you deserve. You get what you negotiate. You're negotiating in everything you do,
so you might as well do it well. Many people come into negotiation with
some, or even a lot of trepidation. They find it unpleasant. I think one reason is that it often
feels like a game of intimidation or a test of wills. Take a look at this
example from the office. >> You meet a lot of ladies
driving an Xterra, because you pull up to a stop light and look
over and there's an Xterra next to you. They're all driven by chicks,
so there's your ice breaker. >> [SOUND] Scratch. >> That's a racing stripe. >> Bumper's sagging. >> Mm, I doubt that very much. >> This car is crap. I will buy it for next to nothing. >> How next to? >> Well, here are your options. You can sell it for parts. Drive it off a cliff. You can donate it to a person that you'd
like to see die in a car crash, or you can sell it to me, and
I'll use it as I would a wagon on my farm. And it will be towed by a donkey. I have to pick one of those? >> Yes. >> Can you go over those options again? >> Hey, you know what, you knock
$1,500 off the price right now, and I will take it off your hands. It's gotta be now. Seal the deal. >> Well, I have-
>> Let's do >> the blue book values. >> Let's do this thing. Three, two, one. >> Can I think about it? >> Five, four, three, two. >> Let me think about it. >> Now, now, now.
Say it. Do it. Now.
Do it now. Do it. Shake my hand. You will sell me this car. Shake my hand. >> Yeah. All right. >> My approach is quite
different from Dwight's. I take a principled
approach to negotiation. That means I'm not gonna teach you how
to yell, scream, lie, or stonewall. No, five, four, three, two, one,
shake my hand, do this deal, say yes now. No. Instead, I'm gonna present principles. These principles will allow you to make
valid arguments that will persuade others. My first job is to persuade you.

In my view,
negotiation is all about the pie. I use the pie as a metaphor for
what's at stake. The pie is the reason
the negotiation is taking place. It's what the parties
are trying to divide. The first question almost everyone
asks is, how do you divide it? In particular,
how do you get as big a slice as possible? Now that's a fine question, and I'll help
you answer it, but it isn't where I start. My starting point is what is the pie? And as you'll soon see,
figuring out the pie isn't always so simple, but once you do
the negotiation becomes much simpler. You'll have a much better chance at
figuring out how to make the pie bigger. [SOUND] And how you make a good argument
to get the biggest possible slice? [SOUND] That's good. [SOUND] That's better. Part of my goal is to turn
negotiation more into a math problem. I want the parties to engage
in joint problem solving. This approach works for complicated real world situations,
not just simple exercises. Indeed, the more complicated the problem, the more important it is to
employ the pie framework. This won't be your standard course,
or even your standard online course. We'll be doing lots of experiments, and we'll employ a combination of
short lectures, animations, negotiation recreations, and
several negotiation cases for you to try. We'll begin with a series of
animations that introduce the theory behind negotiation. We'll start off simple
with just two parties and one issue where everybody
knows everything. But we'll build to negotiations
with many issues and many parties and
where there are plenty of unknowns. Enabling people to bluff and lie. Which will make it even
harder to figure out the pie. After the animations, you'll do your
first negotiation, the Zinket case. I don't recommend jumping ahead. You'll want to apply the principles
we've covered to the case. So, let's begin.
