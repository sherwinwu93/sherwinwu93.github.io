<h2 id="orgadb1203">Lesson 30 The death of a ghost</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgadb1203">
<p class="verse">
Why did the two brothers keep the secret?<br />
<br />
<b>For years</b>, villagers believed that Endly Farm was haunted.<br />
The farm was owned by two brothers, Joe and Bob Cox.<br />
They employed a few farmhands, but no one was willing to work there long.<br />
<b>Every time</b> a worker gave up his job, he told the same story.<br />
Farm labourers said that they always <b>woke up to find that</b> work had been done overnight.<br />
Hay had been cut and cowsheds had been cleaned.<br />
A farm worker, who <b>stayed up</b> all night,<br />
&#xa0;claimed to have seen a figure cutting corn <b>in the moonlight</b>.<br />
In time, <b>it became an accepted fact that</b><br />
&#xa0;the Cox brothers employed a conscientious ghost that did most of their work for them.<br />
<br />
No one <b>suspected that</b> there might be someone else on the farm who had never been seen.<br />
This was indeed the case.<br />
A short time ago, villagers were astonished to learn that the ghost of Endley had died.<br />
Everyone went to the funeral, for the 'ghost' was <b>none other than</b> Eric Cox,<br />
&#xa0;a third brother who <b>was supposed to</b> have died as a young man.<br />
After the funeral, Joe and Bob revealed a secret which they had kept for over fifty years.<br />
<br />
Eric had been the <b>eldest</b> son of the family, very much older than his two brothers.<br />
He had been obliged to join the army during the Second World War.<br />
As he hated army life, he decided to desert his regiment.<br />
When he learnt that he would be sent abroad,<br />
&#xa0;he returned to the farm and his father hid him until the end of the war.<br />
Fearing the authorities, Eric <b>remained in hiding</b> after the war as well.<br />
His father told everybody that Eric had <b>been killed in action</b>.<br />
The only other people who knew the secret were Joe and Bob.<br />
They did not even tell their wives.<br />
When their father died, they <b>thought it their duty to keep Eric in hiding</b>.<br />
All these years, Eric had lived as a recluse.<br />
He used to sleep during the day and work at night,<br />
&#xa0;quite unaware of the fact that he had become the ghost of Endley.<br />
When he died, however, his brothers <b>found it impossible to</b> keep the secret any longer.<br />

Eric joined the army during the Second World War.<br />
As he hated army life and learnt that he would be send abroad,<br />
	he got back to the farm and his father hid him during and after the war.<br />
His father told everyone he was killed in action.<br />
Joe and Bob, his two brothers, who knew the secret,<br />
	kept him in hiding for over fifty years.<br />
They didn't even tell their wives and Eric had lived as a recluse.<br />
His death made it impossible to keep it any longer.<br />

<p>
Eric joined the army during the Second World War, but hated army life, so he deserted.<br />
He returned to the farm where his father hid him until the end of the war,<br />
	and he remained in hiding after the war.<br />
His father told everyone that he had been killed in action.<br />
Joe and Bob kept the secret, so Eric lived as a recluse.<br />
He slept during the day and worked at night, so he became the 'ghost of Endley'.<br />

When I came in to work one morning I noticed that work had been done overnight<br />
	-some hay had been cut and the cowsheds and other buildings had been cleaned,<br />
	so l decided to stay up all the next night to try to solve the mystery.<br />
	(I didn't tell Joe and Bob, of course.)<br />
I hid in the barn and waited.<br />
Obviously I fell asleep because I suddenly woke up to find that it was dark.<br />
I went straight to the cowshed and found that it had already been cleaned.<br />
Then I went out to the Fields where I could just see a figure working;<br />
	I couldn't see whether it was a man, or a woman, or perhaps a ghost.<br />
</p>

<p>
I was scared, so I rushed back to the farmhouse and woke up the others.<br />
We all went out to the fields to see who it was, but when we got there, there was no one there.<br />
When I was in the fields before, I didn't know what or who the figure was.<br />
But now I was sure it was a ghost<br />
	so I immediately decided not to work at Endley Farm any longer<br />
	and handed in my resignation.<br />
When I told my story to the villagers,<br />
	many of them still didn't believe me,<br />
	even though they knew that something strange had been going on at Endley Farm for years.<br />
