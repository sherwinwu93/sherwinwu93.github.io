What was the chance in a million?<br />
<br />
We are less credulous than we used to be.<br />
In the nineteenth century, a novelist would <b>bring his history to a conclusion</b><br />
&#xa0;by presenting his readers with a series of coincidences &#x2013; most of them <b>wildly improbable</b>.<br />
Readers happily <b>accepted the fact that</b> an obscure maidservant was really the hero's mother.<br />
A long-lost brother, who <b>was presumed dead</b>, was really alive all the time<br />
&#xa0;and wickedly <b>plotting to bring about the hero's downfall</b>.<br />
<b>And so on</b>.<br />
Modern readers would find such naive solutions totally unacceptable.<br />
Yet, in real life, circumstances do sometimes <b>conspire to</b> bring about coincidences<br />
&#xa0;which <b>anyone but</b> a nineteenth century novelist would find incredible.<br />
<br />
When I was a boy,<br />
&#xa0;my grandfather told me<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;how a German taxi driver, Franz Bussman, found a brother<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;who <b>was thought to</b> have been killed twenty years before.<br />
While on a walking tour with his wife, he <b>stopped to</b> talk to a workman.<br />
After they had gone on,<br />
&#xa0;Mrs. Bussman <b>commented on the workman's close resemblance to her husband</b><br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and even <b>suggested that</b> he might be his brother.<br />
Franz <b>poured scorn on</b> the idea,<br />
&#xa0;pointing out that his brother had been killed in action during the war.<br />
Though Mrs. Bussman <b>was fully acquainted with</b> this story,<br />
&#xa0;she thought that <b>there was a chance in a million that</b> she might be right.<br />
A few days later, she sent a boy to the workman to ask him<br />
&#xa0;if his name was Hans Bussman.<br />
<b>Needless to say</b>, the man's name was Hans Bussman and he really was Franz's long-lost brother.<br />
When the brothers <b>were reunited</b>, Hans explained how it was that he was still alive.<br />
After having been wounded <b>towards the end of the war</b>,<br />
&#xa0;he had been sent to hospital and <b>was separated from</b> his unit.<br />
The hospital had been bombed and Hans had <b>made his way back into</b> Western Germany on foot.<br />
Meanwhile, his unit was lost and all records of him had been destroyed.<br />
Hans <b>returned to</b> his family home,<br />
&#xa0;but the house had been bombed<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and no one in the neighbourhood knew what had <b>become of</b> the inhabitants.<br />
<b>Assuming that</b> his family had been killed during an air raid,<br />
&#xa0;Hans settled down in a village fifty miles away where he had remained ever since.<br />

<p>
When the war finished,<br />
	Franz Bussman did everything he could to get information about his brother Hans.<br />
With no information, he reluctantly assumed his brother was dead and gave up the search.<br />
With no family, and having been unable to find his brother,<br />
	Franz found it difficult to settle down.<br />
Over the years he moved from place to place and from job to job,<br />
	never staying very long in one place.<br />
When he met Anna (now Mrs. Bussman),he was working as a waiter in a hotel.<br />
He and Anna got married and Franz settled down at last.<br />
He moved from the dinning room into the kitchen of the hotel and became a cook.<br />
But this did not last very long.<br />
</p>

<p>
He was talking to a friend one day, a taxi driver,<br />
	who suggested that they should go into partnership.<br />
So they did, and Franz became a taxi driver.<br />
He and the friend drove taxis themselves,<br />
	but they also soon owned four more taxis and employed four drivers.<br />
He visited his home town once to visit his old house, but it was a sad visit.<br />
There was a large modern block of flats where his family house used to be.<br />
And although he spoke to some of the apartment owners,<br />
	no one remembered him or his family.<br />
Now that he has finally found his brother Hans,<br />
	he and Anna are planning to invite Hans to come<br />
		and live near them<br />
		and work as a taxi driver in the company.<br />
