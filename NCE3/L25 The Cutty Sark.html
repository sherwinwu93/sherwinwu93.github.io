<h2 id="org8df6047">Lesson 25 The Cutty Sark</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8df6047">
<p class="verse">
What piece of bad luck prevented the Cutty Sark from winning the race?<br />
<br />
One of the most famous sailing ships of the 19th century,<br />
&#xa0;the Cutty Sark, can be seen at Greenwich.<br />
She stands on dry land and is visited by thousands of people each year.<br />
She serves as an impressive reminder of the great ships of the past.<br />
Before they <b>were replaced by</b> steamships,<br />
&#xa0;sailing vessels like the Cutty Sark were used to carry tea from China and wool from Australia.<br />
The Cutty Sark was one of the fastest sailing ships that has ever been built.<br />
The only other ship to match her was the Thermopylae.<br />
Both these ships set out from Shanghai on June 18th, 1872 on an exciting race to England.<br />
This race, which went on for exactly four months, was the last of its kind.<br />
It marked the end of the great tradition of ships with sails and <b>the beginning of a new era</b>.<br />
<br />
The first of the two ships to reach Java after the race had begun was the Thermopylae,<br />
&#xa0;but on the Indian Ocean, the Cutty Sark <b>took the lead</b>.<br />
It seemed certain that she would be the first ship home,<br />
&#xa0;but during the race she had a lot of bad luck.<br />
In August, she <b>was struck by</b> a very heavy storm during which her rudder was torn away.<br />
The Cutty Sark rolled <b>from side to side</b> and it <b>became impossible to</b> steer her.<br />
A temporary rudder was made on board from spare planks and it <b>was fitted with great difficulty</b>.<br />
This greatly reduced the speed of the ship,<br />
&#xa0;for <b>there was a danger that</b> if she travelled too quickly,<br />
&#xa0;this rudder would be torn away as well.<br />
Because of this the Cutty Sark <b>lost her lead</b>.<br />
After crossing the Equator,<br />
&#xa0;the captain called in at a port to have a new rudder fitted,<br />
&#xa0;but by now the Thermopylae was over five hundred miles ahead.<br />
Though the new rudder was fitted at tremendous speed, it was impossible for the Cutty Sark to win.<br />
She arrived in England a week after the Thermopylae.<br />
Even this was remarkable, considering that she had had so many delays.<br />
<b>There is no doubt that</b> if she had not lost her rudder she would have won the race easily.<br />

After the race had begun, the Thermopylae reached Java at first,<br />
	but on the Indian Ocean, the Cutty Sark took the lead.<br />
In August, the Cutty Sark was struck by a heavy storm<br />
	during which her rudder was torn away.<br />
This reduced the speed of the ship, she lost her lead.<br />
After crossing the Equator, the captain called in at a port to have a new rudder fitted<br />
