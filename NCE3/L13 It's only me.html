What did the man expect to find under the stairs?<br />
<br />
After her husband had gone to work,<br />
&#xa0;Mrs. Richards sent her children to school and went upstairs to her bedroom.<br />
She was too excited to do any housework that morning,<br />
&#xa0;for in the evening she would be going to a <b>fancy-dress party</b> with her husband.<br />
She intended to dress up as a ghost<br />
&#xa0;and as she had made her costume the night before, she <b>was impatient to</b> try it on.<br />
Though the costume <b>consisted only of</b> a sheet, it was very effective.<br />
After putting it on, Mrs Richards went downstairs.<br />
She wanted to find out whether it would be comfortable to wear.<br />
<br />
Just as Mrs. Richards was entering the dining room, there was a knock on the front door.<br />
She knew that it must be the baker.<br />
She had told him to come straight in<br />
&#xa0;if ever she failed to open the door and to leave the bread on the kitchen table.<br />
Not wanting to frighten the poor man,<br />
&#xa0;Mrs Richards quickly hid in the small storeroom under the stairs.<br />
She heard the front door open and heavy footsteps in the hall.<br />
Suddenly the door of the storeroom was opened and a man entered,<br />
&#xa0;Mrs Richards realized that it must be the man from the Electricity Board<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;who had come to read the metre.<br />
She tried to explain the situation, saying 'It's only me', but it was too late.<br />
The man <b>let out a cry</b> and jumped back several paces.<br />
When Mrs. Richards walked towards him, he fled, slamming the door behind him.<br />

Mrs. Richards immediately went upstairs and took off her costume.<br />
She felt sorry for the poor man from the Electricity Board,<br />
	but at the same time she was rather amused.<br />
Suddenly, there was a knock at the front door and Mrs. Richards opened it at once.<br />
The electricity man had returned accompanied by a policeman,<br />
	so she invited both in.<br />
The man told Mrs.Richards that he had tried to read her metre<br />
	and that there was a ghost in the storeroom.<br />
Though Mrs. Richards explained that she had dressed up as a ghost,<br />
	he refused to believe her.<br />
She told him to open the storeroom door, but he was too frightened,<br />
	so she opened it herself.<br />
While the electricity man and the policeman were looking for the ghost in the storeroom,<br />
	Mrs. Richards fetched her costume.<br />
She showed it to both men and only then did they believe her.<br />
