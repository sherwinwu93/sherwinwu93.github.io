<h2 id="org65ea7ac">Lesson 21 Daniel Mendoza</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org65ea7ac">
<p class="verse">
How many unsuccessful attempts did Mendoza make before becoming Champion of all England?<br />
<br />
Boxing matches were very popular in England two hundred years ago.<br />
In those days, boxers fought <b>with bare fists</b> for prize money.<br />
<b>Because of this</b>, they were known as 'prizefighters'.<br />
However, boxing was very crued, for there were no rules<br />
&#xa0;and a prizefighter could be seriously injured or even killed during a match.<br />
<br />
One of the most colourful figures in boxing history was Daniel Mendoza, who <b>was born in</b> 1764.<br />
The use of gloves was not introduced until 1860,<br />
&#xa0;when the Marquis of Queensberry <b>drew up</b> the first <b>set of</b> rules.<br />
Though he was technically a prizefighter,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;Mendoza did much to <b>change crude prizefighting into a sport</b>,<br />
&#xa0;for he <b>brought science to the game</b>.<br />
<b>In his day</b>, Mendoza enjoyed tremendous popularity.<br />
He was adored by rich and poor alike.<br />
<br />
Mendoza <b>rose to fame</b> swiftly after a boxing match when he was only fourteen years old.<br />
This attracted the attention of Richard Humphries,<br />
&#xa0;who was then the most eminent boxer in England.<br />
He offered to train Mendoza and his young pupil <b>was quick to learn</b>.<br />
<b>In fact</b>, Mendoza soon became so successful that Humphries <b>turned against him</b>.<br />
The two men <b>quarrelled bitterly</b><br />
&#xa0;and <b>it was clear that</b> the <b>argument could only be settled</b> by a fight.<br />
A match was held at Stilton, where both men fought for an hour.<br />
The public <b>bet a great deal of money on Mendoza</b>, but he was defeated.<br />
Mendoza met Humphries in the ring on a later occasion and he lost for a second time.<br />
<b>It was not until</b> his third match in 1790<br />
&#xa0;that he finally beat Humphries and became Champion of England.<br />
Meanwhile, he founded a highly successful Academy and even Lord Byron became one of his pupils.<br />
He earned enormous sums of money and was paid <b>as much as</b> 100 dollars for a single appearance.<br />
Despite this, he was so extravagant that he <b>was always in debt</b>.<br />
After he was defated by a boxer called Gentleman Jackson, he was quickly forgotten.<br />
He was sent to prison for failing to pay his debts and died <b>in poverty</b> in 1836.<br />

<p>
The first fight between Humphries and his pupil Mendoza,<br />
	after a quarrel,<br />
	was held at Stilton and attracted a lot of attention.<br />
At the time, Richard Humphries was the most eminent boxer in England and had many supporters.<br />
But the young Mendoza had his supporters, too.<br />
The atmosphere before the fight was electric.<br />
Half of the people there made bets on Humphries,<br />
	the other half bet on Mendoza.<br />
When the two fighters entered the ring,<br />
	there was a lot of shouting and cheering.<br />
The referee called both fighters to the middle of the ring,<br />
	spoke to them and the fight started.<br />
At first, both men were very wary.<br />
</p>

<p>
After all, this was a fight between teacher and pupil<br />
	so they knew very well what the other could do<br />
	-&#x2014; and they were fighting with bare fists.<br />
Each of the boxers fought well for most of the match,<br />
	but in the end Humphries was too strong and too experienced for the young Mendoza.<br />
He knocked him down once: Mendoza got up.<br />
He nocked him down again, and although Mendoza tried to get up, he just couldn't.<br />
The referee counted ten and that was the end of the match.<br />
When Mendoza got up, he was very angry, but eventually congratulated Humphries.<br />
However, his defeat made him determined to go on and fight his teacher again<br />
	so that he could finally become champion.<br />
