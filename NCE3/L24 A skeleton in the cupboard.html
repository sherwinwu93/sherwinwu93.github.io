<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2384879">
<p class="verse">
Who was Sebastian?<br />
<br />
We often read in novels<br />
&#xa0;how a seemingly respectable person or family has some terrible secret<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;which has <b>been concealed from</b> strangers for years.<br />
The English language possesses a vivid saying to describe this sort of situation.<br />
The terrible secret is called 'a skeleton in the cupboard'.<br />
At some dramatic moment in the story, the terrible secret becomes known and a reputation is ruined.<br />
The reader's <b>hair stands on end</b><br />
&#xa0;when he reads in the final pages of the novel<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that the heroine, a dear old lady who had always been so kind to everybody,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;had, <b>in her youth</b>, poisoned every one of her five husbands.<br />
<br />
<b>It is all very well</b> for such things to occur in fiction.<br />
<b>To varying degrees</b>, we all have secrets<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;which we do not want even our closest friends to learn,<br />
&#xa0;but few of us have skeletons in the cupboard.<br />
The only person I know who has a skeleton in the cupboard is George Carlton,<br />
&#xa0;and he is very pround of the fact.<br />
George studied medicine in his youth.<br />
Instead of becoming a doctor, however, he became a successful writer of detective stories.<br />
I once spent an uncomfortable weekend which I shall never forget at his house.<br />
George <b>showed me to</b> the guestroom which, he said, was rarely used.<br />
He told me to unpack my things and then come down to dinner.<br />
After I had stacked my shirts and underclothes <b>in two empty drawers</b>,<br />
&#xa0;I decided to hang one of the two suits I had <b>brought with me</b> in the cupboard.<br />
I opened the cupboard door and then stood in front of it petrified.<br />
A skeleton was dangling before my eyes.<br />
The sudden movement of the door made it sway slightly<br />
&#xa0;and <b>it gave me the impression that</b> it <b>was about to leap out at</b> me.<br />
Dropping my suit, I dashed downstairs to tell George.<br />
This was worse than 'a terrible secret'; this was a real skeleton!<br />
But George was unsympathetic,<br />
&#xa0;'Oh, that,'	he said with a smile as if he were talking about an old friend.<br />
'That's Sebastian. You forget that I was a <b>medical student once upon a time</b>.'<br />

I was showed to the guest room which was rarely used.<br />
After having stacked my shirts and underclothes in the drawers,<br />
	I opened the cupboard door to hang my suit in the cupboard.<br />
A skeleton was dangling before my eyes<br />
	and it gave me the impression that it was about to leap out at me.<br />
Dropping my suit, I rushed downstairs to tell George.<br />
But George was unsympathetic and told me:<br />
	'That's Sebastian. You forget that I was a medical student once upon a time'.<br />
</p>

<p>
The writer started to unpack and put his shirts and underclothes into drawers<br />
	and then decided to hang a suit in the cupboard.<br />
He opened the cupboard and stood petrified: there, dangling in front of him, was a skeleton.<br />
It was swaying and ready to leap out at him.<br />
He dropped his suit and dashed downstairs to tell George.<br />
Georage was unsympathetic and told the writer<br />
	it was Sebastian, a skeleton he had when he was a medical student.<br />

Now that George had explained about the skeleton, I felt better,<br />
	but I still didn't want to sleep in the room with a skeleton hanging in the cupboard.<br />
I asked George to remove him, but he refused.<br />
'There's nowhere else to put him,' said George, 'so he'll have to stay.'<br />
I couldn't disagree of course,<br />
	but the moment I lay down to sleep, I knew it was going to be an uncomfortable night.<br />
In the end, I decided that I would take Sebastian somewhere for the night<br />
	and bring him back up to my room early in the morning.<br />
So I took him out of cupboard and walked around the house with him<br />
	trying to find somewhere to put him.<br />
</p>

<p>
George's maid was just going to bed as I walked along the landing.<br />
She saw Sebastian apparently walking around, screamed and fainted.<br />
She had obviously woken Carlton who appeared from his bedroom and,<br />
	when the girl had regained consciousness, explained everything to her.<br />
He accused me of being stupid and sent me and Sebastian back to our's room<br />
	where I hung him up in the cupboard again.<br />
Imagine my surprise when I picked up one of Carlton's detective stories two years later.<br />
There I was, with Sebastianthe skeleton,<br />
	as the main characters in one of his stories for the whole world to read.<br />
Still, he didn't use my real name,so I should be glad of that!<br />
