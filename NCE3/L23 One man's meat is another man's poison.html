<p class="verse">
What was it about snails that made the writer collect them for his friend on that day in particular?<br />
<br />
People become quite illogical when they try to decide what can be eaten and what cannot be eaten.<br />
If you lived in the Mediterranean, <b>for instance</b>, you would consider octopus a great delicacy.<br />
You would not be able to understand why some people find it repulsive.<br />
On the other hand, your stomach would turn at the idea of frying potatoes in animal fat<br />
&#xa0;&#x2013; the normally accepted practice in many northern countries.<br />
<b>The sad truth is that</b> most of us have <b>been brought up to eat</b> certain foods<br />
&#xa0;and we <b>stick to them</b> all our lives.<br />
<br />
No creature has <b>received more praise and abuse than</b> the common garden snail.<br />
Cooked in wine, snails are a great luxury in various parts of the world.<br />
There are countless people<br />
&#xa0;who, ever since their early years, have learned to <b>associate snails with food</b>.<br />
My friend, Robert, lives in a country where snails are despised.<br />
As his flat is in a large town, he has no garden of his own.<br />
For years he has been asking me to collect snails from my garden and take them to him.<br />
The idea never <b>appealed to me</b> very much, but one day, <b>after a heavy shower</b>,<br />
&#xa0;I happened to be walking in my garden<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;when I <b>noticed</b> a huge number of snails <b>taking a stroll</b> on some of my prize plants.<br />
Acting on a sudden impulse,<br />
&#xa0;I collected several dozen, put them in a paper bag, and took them to Robert.<br />
Robert <b>was delighted to see</b> me and equally pleased with my little gift.<br />
I left the bag in the hall<br />
&#xa0;and Robert and I went into the living room where we talked for a couple of hours.<br />
I had forgotten all about the snails when Robert suddenly said that I must <b>stay to dinner</b>.<br />
Snails would, of course, be the main dish.<br />
I did not fancy the idea and I reluctantly followed Robert out of the room.<br />
<b>To our dismay</b>, we saw that there were snails everywhere:<br />
&#xa0;they had escaped from the paper bag and had <b>taken complete possession of</b> the hall!<br />
I have never been able to look at a snail since then.<br />

I took the snails to Robert.<br />
I left the bag in the hall and Robert<br />

After Robert asked me to stay to dinner,<br />
	we went out of the room finding the snails taking possession of the hall.<br />
Since then, I have never been able to look at a snail.<br />

The writer collected several dozen snails,<br />

The snails had escaped from the paper bag and they were everywhere<br />
	-&#x2014;on the walls, on the ceiling, on the carpet, and even on the large hall mirror.<br />
When we began to look carefully, we found that they were even in coat pockets in the clothes<br />
	hanging on the clothes hooks in the hall.<br />
It was disgusting!<br />
Snails move slowly but it's amazing how far they can travel in a couple of hours!<br />
It took Robert and me ages to collect them.<br />
He fetched a pair of steps for me and ladders for himself and we collected them in two buckets.<br />
</p>

<p>
There were snail marks everywhere, too, and it took hours to clear up the mess<br />
	-&#x2014;remember, there were several dozen of them.<br />
Snails may not be fast, but we had been talking for a couple of hours,<br />
	and they can travel.<br />
Even now I am sure we didn't find them all: some are still crawling round Robert's house.<br />
The ones that we did not find were lucky!<br />
Robert was amused, but I wasn't.<br />
He decided to cook the snails and invited me to stay.<br />
I said before that I didn't fancy the idea, so I left him to his meal for one.<br />
I just couldn't look at the snails and have never been able to face them since then.<br />
