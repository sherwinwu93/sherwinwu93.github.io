* Lesson 14 A noble gangster
#+begin_verse
How did Hawkwood make money in times of peace?

*There was a time
	when* the owners of shops and businesses in Chicago
		had to *pay large sums of money to* gangsters in return for ‘protection’.
If the money was not paid promptly,
	the gangsters would quickly *put a man out of business* by destroying his shop.
Obtaining '*protection money*' is not a modern crime.
*As long ago as* the fourteenth century,
	an Englishman, Sir John Hawkwood, *made the remarkable discovery*
	 that people *would rather* pay large sums of money
		 *than* have their life work destroyed by gangsters.

Six hundred years ago,
	Sir John Hawkwood arrived in Italy with *a band of* soldiers and settled near Florence.
He soon *made a name for himself* and *came to be known to the Italians as* Giovanni Acuto.
Whenever the Italian city-states *were at war with* each other,
	Hawkwood used to hire his soldiers to princes
		who were willing to pay the high price he demanded.
*In times of peace*, when business was bad,
	Hawkwood and his men would march into a city-state and,
		after burning down a few farms,
	would *offer to go away* if protection money was paid to them.
Hawkwood *made large sums of money* in this way.
In spite of this, the Italians *regarded him as* a sort of hero.
When he died at the age of eighty,
	the Florentines *gave him a state funeral*
		and had a picture painted which *was dedicated to the memory of*
			'the most valiant soldier and most notable leader, Signor Giovanni Acuto'.

News that Hawkwood and his men were approaching
	caused panic among villagers who prepared to defend their farms.
Hawkwood had a bad reputation among farmers
	because they knew he would not hesitate to kill them and to burn their farms.
The farmers fought very hard, even though they were poorly armed.
With their sticks and spades, they were no match for Hawkwood's well-armed soldiers
	who had horses, swords and bows and arrows.
During the battle, a great many farmers were killed.
After Hawkwood destroyed their farms,
	he sent a message to the prince of the city-state demanding a large amount of protection money.
He said that if this money was paid, he would go away and cause no more trouble.
However, if it wasn't paid, he would invade the city.
To Hawkwood's amazement, this demand was refused, so he and his men invaded the city.
As a result, many buildings were destroyed
	and thousands of people were killed including quite a few of Hawkwood's soldiers.
The city people fought very hard until Hawkwood and his men were finally driven off.
Because the city people defended themselves so well,
	Hawkwood never attacked them again.
He and the prince even became friends.
