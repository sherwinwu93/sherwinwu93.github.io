#+begin_verse
How did Mr. Taylor try to stop the thieves?

The expensive shops in a famous arcade near Piccadilly were just opening.
At this time of morning, the arcade was almost empty.
Mr. Taylor, the owner of a jewellery shop was admiring a new window display.
Two of his assistants had been working busily since eight o'clock and had *only just* finished.
Diamond necklaces and rings had been beautifully arranged on a background of black velvet.
After gazing at the display for several minutes, Mr. Taylor went back into his shop.

The silence was suddenly broken
	when a large car, with its headlights on and its horn blaring, roared down the arcade.
It *came to a stop* outside the jeweller's.
One man stayed at the wheel
	while two others with black stockings over their faces
		jumped out and smashed the window of the shop with iron bars.
While this was going on, Mr. Taylor was upstairs.
He and his staff began throwing furniture out of the window.
Chairs and tables went flying into the arcade.
One of the thieves was struck by a heavy statue,
	but he was *too busy helping himself to diamonds to* notice any pain.
The raid was all over in three minutes,
	for the men scrambled back into the car
		and it moved off *at a fantastic speed*.
Just as it was leaving,
	Mr. Taylor rushed out and ran after it throwing ashtrays and vases,
	but it was impossible to stop the thieves.
They had got away with *thousands of pounds worth of diamonds*.

Seeing the thieves' car join the traffic on Piccadilly,
	Mr. Taylor took a taxi and followed them.
The taxi driver drove at full speed when Mr. Taylor told him what had happened.
There wasn't too much traffic at this time of the morning
	so there was a mad chase through the streets of London.
For a short time, the thieves' car was on the wrong side of the road and hit another car,
	but it did not stop.
Two policemen in a police car watched in amazement as the two vehicles went past,
	both breaking the speed limit.
Lights on and horn blaring,
	the police car chased both the speeding cars.
Mr. Taylor's taxi stopped when the traffic lights turned red.
The thieves ignored the traffic lights and got away.
Meanwhile, the police caught up with the taxi at the traffic lights
	and the taxi driver was charged with speeding.
They refused to let the driver off, even though Mr.Taylor carefully explained the situation.
However, the police informed another police car of the chase
	and ten minutes later the thieves' car was found abandoned in a side street.
The thieves had escaped on foot and disappeared among the crowd.
