What is the basis of 'sick' humour?<br />
<br />
Whether we find a joke funny or not largely depends on where we have been brought up.<br />
The sense of humour <b>is mysteriously bound up with</b> national characteristics.<br />
A Frenchman, for instance, might <b>find it hard to laugh</b> at a Russian joke.<br />
In the same way, a Russian might fail to see anything amusing in a joke<br />
&#xa0;which would make an Englishman <b>laugh to tears</b>.<br />
<br />
Most funny stories are based on comic situations.<br />
In spite of national differences, certain funny situations <b>have a universal appeal</b>.<br />
No matter where you live, you would find it difficult not to laugh at,<br />
&#xa0;say, Charlie Chaplin's early films.<br />
However, a new type of humour, which <b>stems largely from</b> the US, has recently <b>come into fashion</b>.<br />
It is called 'sick humour'.<br />
Comedians <b>base their jokes on</b> tragic situations like violent death or serious accidents.<br />
Many people find this sort of joke distasteful.<br />
The following example of 'sick humour' will enable you to <b>judge for yourself</b>.<br />
<br />
A man who had broken his right leg was taken to hospital a few weeks before Christmas.<br />
From the moment he arrived there,<br />
&#xa0;he kept on <b>pestering his doctor to tell</b> him when he would be able to go home.<br />
He <b>dreaded having</b> to spend Christmas in hospital.<br />
Though the doctor <b>did his best</b>, the patient's recovery was slow.<br />
On Christmas Day, the man still had his right leg in plaster.<br />
He spent a miserable day in bed thinking of all the fun he was missing.<br />
The following day, however, the doctor consoled him by telling him<br />
&#xa0;that his chances of being able to leave hospital in time for New Year celebrations were good.<br />
The man <b>took heart</b> and, sure enough, on New Year's Eve he was able to hobble along to a party.<br />
To <b>compensate for</b> his unpleasant experiences in hospital,<br />
&#xa0;the man drank a little more than <b>was good for him</b>.<br />
<b>In the process</b>, he enjoyed himself thoroughly<br />
&#xa0;and kept telling everybody how much he hated hospitals.<br />
He was still mumbling something about hospitals at the end of the party<br />
&#xa0;when he slipped on a piece of ice and broke his left leg.<br />

<p>
An aunt of mine lives in a small village in the country<br />
	and tells this story of what happened to her once.<br />
In order to understand the story, you should know a little about life in an English village.<br />
For example, people often enjoy afternoon tea together,<br />
	they still leave doors unlocked,<br />
	and certain tradesmen are used to delivering goods and,<br />
	with permission, leaving them inside the owner's house.<br />
One day my aunt had invited some friends round for afternoon tea.<br />
She had put some cakes in the oven to bake, and had gone upstairs to do some cleaning.<br />
When she finished, she decided to have a bath before her friends arrived.<br />
</p>

<p>
She was just about to get into the bath when she suddenly remembered the cakes.<br />
She wrapped a bath towel round her, went down to the kitchen and took the cakes out of the oven.<br />
Just then, there was a knock on the back door.<br />
She was sure it was the baker,<br />
	who would open the door, come in and leave the bread on the kitchen table.<br />
She panicked, dashed into the cupboard under the stairs and closed the door.<br />
Then, horrified, she heard footsteps coming to the cupboard.<br />
The door opened and there stood the gasman who had come to read the meter<br />
	&#x2013; which was in the cupboard.<br />
My aunt blushed and said, 'I'm very sorry. I was expecting the baker.'<br />
'Oh,' the gasman said."Sorry, madam".<br />
He closed the door gently and left.<br />
