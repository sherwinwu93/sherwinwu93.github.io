<h2 id="orgb33d7b0">Lesson 12 Life on a desert island</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb33d7b0">
<p class="verse">
What was exceptional about the men's stay on the desert island?<br />
<br />
Most of us have <b>formed an unrealistic picture of</b> life on a desert island.<br />
We sometimes <b>imagine a desert island to be a sort of</b> paradise where the sun always shines.<br />
Life there is simple and good.<br />
Ripe fruit falls from the trees and you never have to work.<br />
The other side of the picture is quite the opposite.<br />
Life on a desert island is wrectched.<br />
You either <b>starve to death</b> or live like Robinson Crusoe,<br />
&#xa0;waiting for a boat which never comes.<br />
Perhaps there is <b>an element of truth</b> in both these pictures,<br />
&#xa0;but few of us have <b>had the opportunity to</b> find out.<br />
<br />
Two men who recently spent five days on a coral island <b>wished they had stayed</b> there longer.<br />
They were taking a badly damaged boat from the Virgin Islands to Miami to have it repaired.<br />
During the journey, their boat began to sink.<br />
They quickly <b>loaded a small rubber dinghy with</b> food, matches, and cans of beer<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and rowed for a few miles across the Caribbean<br />
&#xa0;until they arrived at a tiny coral island.<br />
There were hardly any trees on the island and there was no water,<br />
&#xa0;but this did not prove to be a problem.<br />
The men collected rainwater in the rubber dinghy.<br />
As they had brought a spear gun with them, they had plenty to eat.<br />
They caught lobster and fish every day, and, <b>as one of them put it</b> 'ate like kings'.<br />
When a passing tanker rescued them five days later,<br />
&#xa0;both men <b>were genuinely sorry that</b> they had to leave.<br />

The ship went down and everyone was drowned.<br />
I was the only one who managed to jump into the sea.<br />
I clung to a plank in the water for several hours till I was washed up on a desert island.<br />
I slept on the beach for a very long time &#x2013; I can't remember how long.<br />
When I woke up, I was hungry and thirsty, so I decided to explore the island.<br />
It was uninhabited, but I found plenty of fruit which had fallen from the trees.<br />
I lived on coconuts and pineapples and there was plenty of fresh spring water.<br />
</p>

<p>
I tried to hunt wild animals with my bare hands(small pigs and other creatures),<br />
	but I failed to catch anything.<br />
So I spent my days swimming in the warm clear water and lying in the sun.<br />
One afternoon while I was lying on the beach as usual, I saw a boat on the horizon.<br />
I signalled with my white shirt and shouted as loudly as I could.<br />
Fortunately, someone on the boat saw me and I was rescued.<br />
Of course, I was pleased to get back to civilization,<br />
	but I was very sorry to leave this island paradise.<br />
