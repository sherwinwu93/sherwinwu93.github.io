<h2 id="orgf6a98f4">Lesson 07 Mutilated ladies</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf6a98f4">
<p class="verse">
Why did Jane cook John's wallet?<br />
<br />
Has it ever happened to you?<br />
Have you ever put your trousers in the washing machine<br />
&#xa0;and then remembered there was a large bank note in your back pocket?<br />
When you rescued your trousers, did you find the note was whiter than white?<br />
People who live in Britain needn't despair<br />
&#xa0;when they make mistakes like this (and a lot of people do)!<br />
Fortunately for them, the Bank of England has a team<br />
&#xa0;called Mutilated Ladies which <b>deals with</b> claims from people<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;who fed their money to a machine or to their dogs.<br />
Dogs, it seems, love to chew up money!<br />
<br />
A recent case concerns Jane Butlin whose fiance, John, runs a successful furniture business.<br />
John had a very good day<br />
&#xa0;and put his wallet containing 3000 dollars into the microwave oven <b>for safekeeping</b>.<br />
Then he and Jane <b>went horse-riding</b>.<br />
When they got home, Jane cooked their dinner in the microwave oven and without realizing it,<br />
&#xa0;cooked her fiance's wallet as well.<br />
<b>Imagine their dismay when</b> they found a beautifully-cooked wallet and notes turned to ash!<br />
John went to see his bank manager who sent the remains of wallet<br />
&#xa0;and the money to the special department of the Bank of England in Newcastle: the Mutilated Ladies!<br />
They examined the remains and John got all his money back.<br />
'<b>So long as</b> there's something to identify, we will give people their money back,'<br />
&#xa0;said a spokeswoman for the Bank,<br />
'Last year, we paid 1.5 million dollars on 21,000 claims.'<br />

Jane opened the oven door and saw that her meal was ready to serve.<br />
She took the food out of the oven and in doing so,<br />
	noticed something strange inside the oven which she couldn't recognize.<br />
So she went to find John and told him about it.<br />
In dismay, John quickly explained<br />
	that he had put his wallet containing the day's takings into the oven for safekeeping.<br />

<p>
They both rushed to the oven and saw that the money had been destroyed.<br />
At first they didn't know what to do.<br />
John wanted to throw the money away, but Jane wouldn't let him.<br />
'lt's best not to disturb the wallet,' Jane said.<br />
'You can see all the money is there, even if it has been destroyed.'<br />
Jane told John to go and see his bank manager for advice,<br />
