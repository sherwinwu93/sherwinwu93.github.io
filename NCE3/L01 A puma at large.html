<h2 id="orgcaa1939">Lesson 01 A puma at large</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcaa1939">
<p class="verse">
Where must the puma have come from?<br />
<br />
Puma are large, cat-like animals which <b>are found in</b> America.<br />
When reports came into London Zoo<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that a wild puma had been spotted forty-five miles south of London,<br />
&#xa0;they <b>were not taken seriously</b>.<br />
However, as the evidence began to accumulate,<br />
&#xa0;experts from the Zoo <b>felt obliged to investigate</b>,<br />
&#xa0;for the descriptions given by people who <b>claimed to have seen</b> the puma<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;were extraordinarily similar.<br />
<br />
The hunt for the puma began in a small village<br />
&#xa0;where a woman picking blackberries saw 'a large cat' only five yards away from her.<br />
It immediately ran away when she saw it,<br />
&#xa0;and experts <b>confirmed that</b> a puma will not attack a human being unless it is cornered.<br />
The search <b>proved difficult</b>,<br />
&#xa0;for the puma was often observed at one place in the morning<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and at another place twenty miles away in the evening.<br />
Wherever it went, it left behind it <b>a trail of</b> dead deer and small animals like rabbits.<br />
Paw prints were seen in a number of places and puma fur <b>was found clinging to bushes</b>.<br />
Several people complained of 'cat-like noises' at night<br />
&#xa0;and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree.<br />
<b>The experts were now fully convinced that</b> the animal was a puma,<br />
&#xa0;but where had it come from?<br />
As no pumas had been reported missing from any zoo in the country,<br />
&#xa0;this one must have been in the possession of a private collector<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and somehow managed to escape.<br />
The hunt <b>went on</b> for several weeks,<br />
&#xa0;but the puma was not caught.<br />
<b>It is disturbing to think</b><br />
&#xa0;that a dangerous wild animal is still <b>at large</b> in the quiet countryside.<br />

The reports were received by London Zoo<br />
	that a puma had been spotted forty-five miles south of London<br />
		were similar in nature.<br />
A woman picking blackberries saw it first,<br />
	but the puma moved from place to place,<br />
		leaving  a trail of dead deer and small animals.<br />
Paw prints and puma fur were found as well.<br />
Cat-like noise was heard at night and the animal was seen up a tree.<br />
Now experts were convinced that the animal really was a puma.<br />

Mrs. Stone had spent the whole morning picking blackberries in the countryside near her home.<br />
It was nearly lunch time, so she decided to return for lunch.<br />
She was just picking up her basket when she heard a noise in the bushes.<br />
Then she saw an animal which looked like a cat.<br />
She knew it was not a cat because it was so large.<br />
The animal suddenly turned round to look at her<br />
	and she thought it was going to come towards her and perhaps attack her.<br />
She dropped her basket and screamed loudly.<br />
Hearing the sound, the animal disappeared into the bushes,<br />
	after which Mr. Stone picked up her basket and ran all the way home.<br />
She told her neighbours that she had seen a puma in the countryside,<br />
	but they did not believe her.<br />
She also telephoned the police but they didn't believe her either.<br />
