<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb875c51">
<p class="verse">
Did George get anything for his fifty pence? What?<br />
<br />
Children always appreciate small gifts of money.<br />
Mum or dad, of course, provide a regular <b>supply of</b> pocket money,<br />
&#xa0;but uncles and aunts are always a source of extra income.<br />
With some children, small sums <b>go a long way</b>.<br />
If fifty pence pieces <b>are not exchanged for</b> sweets, they rattle for months inside money boxes.<br />
Only very thrifty children managed to <b>fill up</b> a money box.<br />
For most of them, fifty pence is a small price to pay for a nice big bar of chocolate.<br />
<br />
My nephew, George, has a money box but it is always empty.<br />
Very few of the fifty pence pieces and pound coins I have given him have <b>found their way</b> there.<br />
I gave him fifty pence yesterday and <b>advised him to save</b> it.<br />
Instead he bought himself fifty pence worth of trouble.<br />
<b>On his way to</b> the sweet shop, he dropped his fifty pence<br />
&#xa0;and it bounced along the pavement and then disappeared down a drain.<br />
George took off his jacket,<br />
&#xa0;<b>rolled up</b> his sleeves and pushed his right arm through the drain cover.<br />
He could not find his fifty pence piece anywhere, and <b>what is more</b>, he could not get his arm out.<br />
A crowd of people gathered round him and a lady <b>rubbed his arm with</b> soap and butter,<br />
&#xa0;but George was firmly stuck.<br />
The fire brigade was called and two fire fighters freed George using <b>a special type of</b> grease.<br />
George was not too upset by his experience<br />
&#xa0;because the lady who owns the sweet shop <b>heard about</b> his troubles<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and <b>rewarded him with</b> a large box of chocolates.<br />

I was walking along the street when I saw a crowd ahead of me.<br />
I could hear people shouting and making a noise.<br />
On arriving at the scene, I saw a small boy on the pavement with his arm in a drain cover.<br />
A lady carrying a large bar of soap and a saucepan of water knelt down beside the boy.<br />
She asked the boy if he was in pain and he said he wasn't.<br />
</p>

<p>
Then she rubbed his arm with butter, but he couldn't get it free.<br />
Meanwhile, someone had telephoned the fire brigade.<br />
The boy had begun to cry, but when he saw the firemen, he cheered up.<br />
At first the firemen decided to cut through the drain cover,<br />
	but they changed their minds and rubbed the boy's arm with a special type of grease.<br />
The boy was soon free and though his arm hurt, he was smiling.<br />
