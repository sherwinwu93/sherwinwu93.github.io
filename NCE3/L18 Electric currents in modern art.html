<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org09b2610">
<p class="verse">
How might some of the exhibits have been dangerous?<br />
<br />
Modern sculpture <b>rarely</b> surprises us <b>any more</b>.<br />
<b>The idea that</b> modern art can only be seen in museums <b>is mistaken</b>.<br />
Even people who <b>take no interest in</b> art<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;cannot have failed to notice examples of modern sculpture on display in public places.<br />
Strange forms stand in gardens, outside buildings and shops.<br />
We have got quite used to them.<br />
Some so called 'modern' pieces have been on display for nearly eighty years.<br />
<br />
In spite of this,<br />
&#xa0;some people -including myself- were surprised by a recent exhibition of modern sculpture.<br />
The first thing I saw when I entered the art gallery was a notice which said:<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;'Do not touch the exhibits. Some of them are dangerous!'<br />
The objects on display were pieces of moving sculpture.<br />
Oddly shaped forms that are suspended from the ceiling and move <b>in response to</b> a gust of wind<br />
&#xa0;<b>are quite familiar to</b> everybody.<br />
These objects, however, were different.<br />
Lined up against the wall, there were long thin wires <b>attached to</b> metal spheres.<br />
The spheres had been magnetized and attracted or repelled each other all the time.<br />
In the centre of the hall, there were a number of tall structures which contained coloured lights.<br />
These lights flicker continuously like traffic lights which have <b>gone mad</b>.<br />
Sparks were emitted from small black boxes and red lamps flashed <b>on and off</b> angrily.<br />
<b>It was rather like</b> an exhibition of prehistoric electronic equipment.<br />
These peculiar forms not only <b>seemed designed to shock</b> people emotionally,<br />
&#xa0;but to give them electric shocks as well.<br />

On entering the art gallery, the writer saw a notice<br />
	which forbade people to touch the exhibits because they were dangerous.<br />
The exhibition consisted of pieces of moving scuplture.<br />
Against a wall, the writer saw long thin wires attached to metal spheres,<br />
	which had been magnetized and attracted or repelled each other.<br />
In the centre of the hall tall were structures containing coloured lights<br />
	which went on and off.<br />
Sparks were emitted from black boxes and red lamps flashed on and off angrily.<br />

Recently I went to the Royal Academy in London to see the summer exhibition.<br />
The work of many artists was on display and the exhibition aroused a lot of public interest.<br />
Crowds of people filled the galleries.<br />
The pictures were, with a few exceptions, mainly by relatively unknown artists.<br />
Many of them were traditional pictures of landscapes and portraits.<br />
I particularly liked a picture of an old farm house by a stream with a few sheep in a field.<br />
The strangest picture I saw was an untitled abstract painting by a well-known modern artist.<br />
</p>

<p>
It consisted of swirls of different colours<br />
	which had been rubbed into the canvas with the artist's fingers.<br />
The picture looked a mess, but was also very effective, attracting a lot of comment.<br />
I couldn't help overhearing what people said,<br />
	things like 'I could paint a picture like that with my eyes shut'<br />
		or 'Look how perfect the sunset is in that painting.<br />
		I'd love to own a picture like that' and so on.<br />
There is no doubt it was an excellent exhibition<br />
	because there were so many different styles on display.<br />
There was something to suit everyone, but only if you could afford the high prices!<br />
