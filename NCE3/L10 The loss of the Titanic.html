<h2 id="orgf659e00">Lesson 10 The loss of the Titanic</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf659e00">
<p class="verse">
What would have happened if only two of the sixteen water-tight compartments had been flooded?<br />
<br />
The great ship, Titanic, sailed for New York from Southampton on April 10th, 1912.<br />
She was carrying 1,316 passengers and <b>a crew of</b> 891.<br />
Even by modern standards, the 46,000 ton Titanic was a colossal ship.<br />
At that time, however, she was not only the largest ship that had ever been built,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;but <b>was regarded as</b> unsinkable,<br />
&#xa0;for she had sixteen watertight compartments.<br />
Even if two of these were flooded, she would still be able to float.<br />
The tragic sinking of this great liner will always be remembered,<br />
&#xa0;for she went down on her first voyage with heavy loss of life.<br />
<br />
Four days after setting out,<br />
&#xa0;while the Titanic was sailing across the icy waters of the North Atlantic,<br />
&#xa0;a huge iceberg was suddenly spotted by a lookout.<br />
After the <b>alarm had been given</b>, the great ship turned sharply to avoid a direct collision.<br />
The Titanic turned just <b>in time</b>, narrowly missing the immense wall of ice<br />
&#xa0;which rose over 100 feet out of the water beside her.<br />
Suddenly, there was a slight trembling sound from below,<br />
&#xa0;and the captain went down to see what had happened.<br />
The noise had been so faint that no one thought that the ship had been damaged.<br />
Below, the captain <b>realized to his horror that</b> the Titanic was sinking rapidly,<br />
&#xa0;for five of her sixteen watertight compartments had already been flooded!<br />
<b>The order to abandon ship was given</b> and hundreds of people plunged into the icy water.<br />
As there were not enough lifeboats for everybody, 1,500 lives were lost.<br />

	when an iceberg was seen by a lookout.<br />
After the alarm was given, the ship turned sharply and sail alongside it.<br />

	so the captain went down to investigate,<br />
	only to found that five of the sixteen compartments had been flooded.<br />
On hearing the order to abandon ship, people jumped overboard,<br />
	but 1,500 peole were drowned because there are not enough lifeboats for everyone.<br />

<p>
The Titanic began to sink, slowly at first.<br />
The order to abandon ship was unexpected, so passengers and crew were completely unprepared.<br />
It was the middle of the night.<br />
Some people were asleep in their cabins.<br />
Others were on deck admiring the brilliant night sky and the giant icebergs rising above them.<br />
Others were eating and dancing in the wonderful ballrooms on the ship.<br />
The immediate effect was panic and confusion.<br />
People began rushing in all directions, wondering what to do next.<br />
The cold was indescribable and many passengers were still in their night clothes.<br />
</p>

<p>
Members of the crew came up from below and began to lower the lifeboats.<br />
It was a case of women and children first,<br />
	but it soon became obvious that there weren't enough lifeboats for everyone,<br />
	so people jumped overboard into the freezing water in order to save their lives.<br />
Some of those swimming in the water struggled to get into the lifeboats,<br />
	but most of them were already full.<br />
The Titanic sank rapidly, carrying many people down with it.<br />
There were cries of despair from people in the water<br />
	as they watched the lifeboats moving away and were left to drown in the icy ocean.<br />
