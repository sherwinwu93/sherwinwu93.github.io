<h2 id="orgb68df48">Lesson 17 The longest suspension bridge in the world</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb68df48">
<p class="verse">
How is the bridge supported?<br />
<br />
Verrazano, an Italian <b>about whom little is known</b>,<br />
&#xa0;sailed into New York Harbour in 1524 and named it Angouleme.<br />
He <b>described it as</b> 'a very <b>agreeable situation</b> <b>located within</b> two small hills<br />
&#xa0;<b>in the midst of</b> which flowed a great river.'<br />
Though Verrazano <b>is by no means considered to be</b> a great explorer,<br />
&#xa0;his name will probably remain immortal,<br />
&#xa0;for on November 21st, 1964, the longest suspension bridge in the world <b>was named after</b> him.<br />
<br />
The Verrazano Bridge, which was designed by Othmar Ammann, <b>joins Brooklyn to Staten Island</b>.<br />
It has <b>a span of</b> 4,260 feet.<br />
The bridge is so long that the shape of the earth had to <b>be taken into account</b> by its designer.<br />
Two great towers support four huge cables.<br />
The towers are built on immense underwater platforms made of steel and concrete.<br />
The platforms extend to a depth of over 100 feet under the sea.<br />
These alone took sixteen months to build.<br />
Above the surface of the water, the towers rise to <b>a height of</b> nearly 700 feet.<br />
They support the cables <b>from which the bridge has been suspended</b>.<br />
Each of the four cables contains 26,108 <b>lengths of wire</b>.<br />
<b>It has been estimated that</b> if the bridge <b>were packed with</b> cars,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;it would still only be carrying <b>a third of</b> its total capacity.<br />
However, size and strength are not the only important things about this bridge.<br />
Despite its immensity, it is both simple and elegant,<br />
&#xa0;<b>fulfilling its designer's dream</b> to create 'an enormous object drawn as faintly as possible'.<br />

The bridge I know best is called the Sydney Harbour Bridge.<br />
It joins either side of Sydney Harbour.<br />
From far away it looks like a great arch,<br />
	but when you get near, you can see a great deck under the arch.<br />
It is made of steel and supported by two towers.<br />
If you stand on the bridge early in the morning,<br />
	you can see the Parramatta River to the west and the open sea to the east.<br />
At this time everything is quiet.<br />
</p>

<p>
During the day, however, the harbour becomes busy with small boats<br />
	and largeships are moving in all directions.<br />
I enjoy standing on the bridge at night<br />
	when you see the magnificent Opera House looking like a great sailing ship.<br />
In the darkness you can see the city lights.<br />
In the stillness the traffic and the movement of the sea are the only sounds that can be heard.<br />
