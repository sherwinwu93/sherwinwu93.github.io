<p class="verse">
Which actor read the letter in the end, the aristocrat or the jailer?<br />
<br />
Some plays are so successful that they run <b>for years on end</b>.<br />
<b>In many ways</b>, this is unfortunate for the poor actors<br />
&#xa0;who <b>are required to go</b> on repeating the same lines night after night.<br />
One would <b>expect them to know their parts by heart</b> and never <b>have cause to</b> falter.<br />
Yet this is not always the case.<br />
<br />
A famous actor in a highly successful play <b>was once cast in the role of</b> an aristocrat<br />
&#xa0;who had been imprisoned in the Bastille for twenty years.<br />
In the last act, a jailer would always come on to the stage with a letter<br />
&#xa0;which he would hand to the prisoner.<br />
Even though the noble was expected to read the letter at each performance,<br />
&#xa0;he always <b>insisted that it should be written out in full</b>.<br />
<br />
One night, the jailer decided to <b>play a joke on</b> his colleague to find out<br />
&#xa0;if, after so many performances, he had managed to learn the contents of the letter by heart.<br />
<b>The curtain went up</b> on the final act of the play<br />
&#xa0;and revealed the aristocrat sitting alone behind bars in his dark cell.<br />
Just then, the jailer appeared with the precious letter in his hands.<br />
He entered the cell and <b>presented the letter to</b> the aristocrat.<br />
But the copy he gave him had not been written out in full as usual.<br />
It was simply <b>a blank sheet of paper</b>.<br />
The jailer <b>looked on</b> eagerly, <b>anxious to see</b> if his fellow actor had <b>at last</b> learnt his lines.<br />
The noble <b>stared at</b> the blank sheet of paper for a few seconds.<br />
Then, squinting his eyes, he said: 'The light is dim. Read the letter to me.'<br />
And he promptly handed the sheet of paper to the jailer.<br />
Finding that he could not remember a word of the letter either,<br />
&#xa0;the jailer replied: 'The light is indeed dim, sire. I must get my glasses.'<br />
With this, he hurried off the stage.<br />
<b>Much to the aristocrat's amusement</b>,<br />
&#xa0;the jailer returned a few moments later<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;with a pair of glasses and the usual copy of the letter<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;which he <b>proceeded to read to the prisoner</b>.<br />

A couple of years ago, a new play called The World Tomorrow<br />
	was going to be shown in our local theatre.<br />
There was a great deal of advertising for it<br />
	and there was considerable public interest,<br />
	mainly, I think, because the cast contained a number of famous actors and actresses.<br />
Most actors and actresses are usually nervous on the first night of any play,<br />
	and no one really knows what can go wrong or how the audience will react.<br />
In the case of The World Tomorrow, no one forgot their lines,<br />
	but the play was not well received.<br />
It was a comedy, so it was supposed to be funny,<br />
	but nobody laughed-&#x2014;not in the right places anyway -&#x2014;<br />
	and people even walked out before the end.<br />
</p>

<p>
The cast suspected that they would get bad reviews the following day, and they did.<br />
One review described it as 'the saddest comedy I've ever seen':<br />
	another thought it was<br />
		'the most professionally acted disaster we have ever seen on our local stage'<br />
In spite of the reviews, however, the play still ran for six weeks.<br />
The last performance, on the last Saturday evening, attracted a small audience,<br />
	and the actors struggled through to the end.<br />
At the end of six terrible weeks, however, there was one final moment of relief.<br />
When the last line was spoken:<br />
	'Our six short weeks have hastened to their end,<br />
		the audience saw the funny side of it and laughed.<br />
		Even the actors and actresses laughed.<br />
