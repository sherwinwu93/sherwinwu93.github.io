<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org91468ec">
<p class="verse">
Was the vicar pleased that the clock was striking? Why?<br />
<br />
Our vicar is always raising money <b>for one cause or another</b>,<br />
&#xa0;but he has never managed to <b>get enough money to have</b> the church clock repaired.<br />
The big clock which used to strike the hours day and night<br />
&#xa0;was damaged many years ago and has been silent ever since.<br />
<br />
One night, however, our vicar <b>woke up with a start</b>:<br />
&#xa0;the clock was striking the hours!<br />
Looking at his watch, he saw that it was one o'clock,<br />
&#xa0;but the bell struck thirteen times before it stopped.<br />
<b>Armed with a torch</b>, the vicar went up into the clock tower to see <b>what was going on</b>.<br />
In the torchlight, he <b>caught sight of a figure</b><br />
&#xa0;whom he immediately <b>recognized as Bill Wilkins</b>, our local grocer.<br />
<br />
'Whatever are you doing up here Bill?' asked the vicar in surprise.<br />
<br />
'I'm trying to repair the bell,' answered Bill.<br />
'I've been coming up here night after night for weeks now.<br />
You see, I was hoping to <b>give you a surprise</b>.'<br />
<br />
'You certainly did give me a surprise!' said the vicar.<br />
'You've probably woken up everyone in the village as well.<br />
Still, <b>I'm glad</b> the bell is working again.'<br />
<br />
'That's the trouble, vicar,' answered Bill.<br />
'It's working all right, but I'm afraid that<br />
&#xa0;at one o'clock it will strike thirteen times and there's nothing I can do about it.'<br />
<br />
'We'll <b>get used to that</b>, Bill,' said the vicar.<br />
'Thirteen is not as good as one, but it's better than nothing.<br />
Now let's go downstairs and have a cup of tea.'<br />

We were used to hearing our church bell striking the hours in our small village.<br />
For as long as anyone could remember, the bell had struck the hours day and night.<br />
However, one night the church bell remained silent<br />
	and the next morning we saw that the clock had stopped at exactly one a.m.<br />
Our clock was clearly damaged, but no one could explain how this had happened.<br />
Armed with a torch, our vicar climbed into the church tower to see what was going on.<br />
He heard a loud buzz<br />
	as he went towards the clock and in the torchlight he found it had been invaded by bees.<br />
He was lucky they didn't sting him!<br />
He shone his torch into the great bell and saw that it was full of wax and honey.<br />
No wonder it wasn't working!<br />
A bee keeper was called in to deal with the situation.<br />
He immediately removed the queen bee to one of his bee hives and the other bees followed.<br />
The clock was cleaned and was soon working again.<br />
We not only enjoyed hearing it strike the hours day and nigt,<br />
	but we enjoyed eating the honey as well.<br />
