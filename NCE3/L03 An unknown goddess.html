<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org17d3d23">
<p class="verse">
How did the archaeologists know that the statue was a goddess?<br />
<br />
Some time ago, <b>an interesting discovery was made</b> by archaeologists on the Aegean island of Kea.<br />
An American team explored a temple<br />
&#xa0;which stands in an ancient city <b>on the promontory</b> of Ayia Irini.<br />
The city at one time must have been prosperous,<br />
&#xa0;for it enjoyed a high level of civilization.<br />
Houses &#x2013; often three storeys high &#x2013; were built of stone.<br />
They had large rooms with beautifully decorated walls.<br />
The city <b>was even equipped with</b> a <b>drainage system</b>,<br />
&#xa0;for a great many clay pipes were found beneath the narrow streets.<br />
<br />
The temple which the archaeologists explored <b>was used as a place of worship</b><br />
&#xa0;from the fifteenth century B.C. until Roman times.<br />
In the most sacred room of the temple, clay fragments of fifteen statues were found.<br />
Each of these represented a goddess and had, at one time, been painted.<br />
The body of one statue was found among remains dating from the fifteen century B.C.<br />
Its missing head <b>happened to be</b> among remains of the fifth century B.C.<br />
This head must have been found in Classical times and carefully preserved.<br />
It was very old and precious even then.<br />
When the archaeologists reconstructed the fragments,<br />
&#xa0;they <b>were amazed to find that</b> the goddess <b>turned out be</b> a very modern-looking woman.<br />
She stood three feet high and her hands rested on her hips.<br />
She was wearing a full-length skirt which swept the ground.<br />
<b>Despite her great age</b>, she was very graceful indeed,<br />
&#xa0;but, so far, the archaeologists have been unable to discover her identity.<br />

After walking round the ancient city, the archaeologists discovered an ancient temple.<br />
This temple had obviously been a place of worship because it contained a sacred room.<br />
On entering the sacred room, the archaeologists found the clay fragments of fifteen statues,<br />
	each of which was a goddess which had once been painted.<br />
After this, workmen began digging and soon discovered the head of a statue among remains<br />
	dating from the fifth century B.C.<br />
They also found the body of this statue among remains from the fifteenth century B.C.<br />
The archaeologists carefully put the fragments together.<br />
They were astonished to find that the figure was a goddess.<br />
The goddess was a modern-looking woman.<br />
She had her hands on her hips and she was wearing a full-length skirt.<br />
Although the archaeologists tried very hard to identify her,<br />
	they were unable to find out her name.<br />
