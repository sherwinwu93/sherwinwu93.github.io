<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org537638f">
<p class="verse">
What is the most important thing for a tramp?<br />
<br />
It has been said that everyone <b>lives by selling</b> something.<br />
<b>In the light of</b> this statement, teachers live by selling knowledge,<br />
&#xa0;philosophers by selling wisdom and priests by selling <b>spiritual comfort</b>.<br />
Though it may be possible to measure that value of material goods <b>in terms of money</b>,<br />
&#xa0;<b>it is extremely difficult to</b> estimate the true value of the services which people perform for us.<br />
There are times when we would willingly give everything we possess to save our lives,<br />
&#xa0;yet we might <b>grudge paying</b> a surgeon a high fee for offering us precisely this service.<br />
The conditions of society are such<br />
&#xa0;that skills have to be paid for in the same way that goods are paid for at a shop.<br />
Everyone has something to sell.<br />
<br />
Tramps <b>seem to be the only exception to this general rule</b>.<br />
Beggars almost sell themselves as human beings to arouse the pity of passers-by.<br />
But real tramps are not beggars.<br />
They have nothing to sell and require nothing from others.<br />
<b>In seeking independence</b>, they do not sacrifice their human dignity.<br />
A tramp may ask you for money, but he will never ask you to fell sorry for him.<br />
He has deliberately <b>chosen to lead</b> the life he leads and is fully aware of the consequences.<br />
He may never be sure where the next meal is coming from,<br />
&#xa0;but he <b>is free from</b> the thousands of anxieties which afflict other people.<br />
His few material possessions make it possible for him to move from place to place <b>with ease</b>.<br />
By having to sleep <b>in the open</b>,<br />
&#xa0;he gets far closer to the world of nature than most of us ever do.<br />
He may hunt, beg, or steal occasionally to keep himself alive;<br />
&#xa0;he may even, in times of real need, do a little work;<br />
&#xa0;but he will never sacrifice his freedom.<br />
We often speak of tramps <b>with contempt</b> and put them in the same class as beggars,<br />
&#xa0;but how many of us can honestly say that<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;we have not <b>felt a little envious of</b> their simple way of life and their freedom from care?<br />

A tramp may ask you for money, but he will never ask you to feel sorry for him.<br />
He may not be sure where the next meal is,<br />
	but he is free from anxieties which afflict other people.<br />
Because he has few material possessions, it is easy for him to move from place to place.<br />
He has to sleep in the open.<br />
To keep himself alive, he may hunt, beg, steal occassionaly and do a little work.<br />
</p>

<p>
Unlike beggars, real tramps have nothing to sell and require nothing from others.<br />
Although they seek independence, they will not sacrifice their human dignity.<br />
They choose their own way of life and are aware of the consequences.<br />
They may not know where the next meal is coming from,<br />
	but they do not have the worries that others have.<br />
They can travel easily because they have few possessions<br />
	and when they sleep in the open, they are close to nature.<br />

The majority of adults in society contribute to society by working.<br />
They work, earn money and pay taxes for the things we all need<br />
	&#x2013; hospitals, schools, public transport, the fire brigade, law and order and so on.<br />
We don't expect children or very old people to work and pay taxes.<br />
But everyone else should.<br />
So why should people like tramps and beggars be different?<br />
Tramps say all they want is their freedom.<br />
Well, they may be free, but their freedom is paid for by everyone else in society.<br />
There are many unemployed people who simply cannot get a job<br />
	&#x2013; but they would work if they could.<br />
And many beggars are people who have turned to begging because they cannot find a job.<br />
</p>

<p>
Tramps are not like them.<br />
Tramps lead a very selfish way of life<br />
	and it is a way of life that shows an unwillingness to assume responsibility for others.<br />
The rest of us have a home, children, work, and so on.<br />
But not tramps!<br />
Tramps are lazy parasites on society,<br />
	and if we all had their mentality, society would not exist for them or anyone else.<br />
Although we might in someways be envious of tramps,<br />
	and although we might envy their freedom,<br />
	how many of us could be as selfish as them?<br />
How many of us could say 'damn the rest of society!'? I couldn't.<br />
