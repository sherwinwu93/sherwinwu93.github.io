<h2 id="org818e9ce">Lesson 37 The Westhaven Express</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org818e9ce">
<p class="verse">
What was the mistake the author made?<br />
<br />
We have learnt to expect that trains will be punctual.<br />
After years of conditioning,<br />
&#xa0;most of us have <b>developed an unshakable faith in</b> railway timetables.<br />
Ships may be delayed by storms; flights may be cancelled because of bad weather;<br />
&#xa0;but trains must be on time.<br />
Only an exceptionally heavy snowfall might temporarily dislocate railway services.<br />
<b>It is all too easy to blame</b> the railway authorities when something does go wrong.<br />
The truth is that when mistakes occur, they are more likely to be ours than theirs.<br />
<br />
After <b>consulting my railway timetable</b>,<br />
&#xa0;I <b>noted with satisfaction that</b> there was an express train to Westhaven.<br />
It <b>went direct</b> from my local station and the journey lasted a mere hour and seventeen minutes.<br />
When I boarded the train, I <b>could not help noticing</b> that a great many local people got on as well.<br />
At the time, this did not <b>strike me as odd</b>.<br />
I <b>reflected that</b> there must be a great many people besides myself<br />
&#xa0;who <b>wished to take advantage of</b> this excellent service.<br />
Neither was I surprised when the train stopped at Widley,<br />
&#xa0;a tiny station a few miles along the line.<br />
Even a mighty express train can <b>be held up</b> by signals.<br />
But when the train dawdled at station after station, I began to wonder.<br />
<b>It suddenly dawned on me</b><br />
&#xa0;that this express was not <b>roaring down</b> the line at ninety miles an hour,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;but barely chugging along at thirty.<br />
One hour and seventeen minutes passed and we had not even covered half the distance.<br />
I asked a passenger if this was the Westhaven Express,<br />
&#xa0;but he had not even <b>heard of</b> it.<br />
I determined to <b>lodge a complaint</b> as soon as we arrived.<br />
Two hours later, I was talking angrily to the station master at Westhaven.<br />
When he denied the train's existence, I borrowed his <b>copy of</b> the timetable.<br />
There was <b>a note of triumph</b> in my voice when I told him that it was there <b>in black and white</b>.<br />
Glancing at it briefly, he told me to look again.<br />
A tiny asterisk <b>conducted me to</b> a footnote <b>at the bottom of</b> the page.<br />
It said: 'This service has been suspended.'<br />

When the writer boarded the train, he noticed that a lot of local people got on as well.<br />
Nor was he surprised when the train stopped at Widley,<br />
	for even an express train may be delayed by signals.<br />
When the train dawdled at station after station,<br />
	he realized that this express was chugging at thrity.<br />
He didn't cover half the distance after one hour and seventeen minutes.<br />
So he asked the passager, who told him that he didn't hear of the express.<br />
Two hours later, he was arguing with the station master.<br />
He told the master that the express was on the timetable in black and white.<br />
However, a tiny asterisk conducted him to a footnote,<br />
	which said: "This service has been suspended".<br />

<p>
When many local people boarded the train with the writer,<br />
	he was not surprised.<br />
Nor was he surprised when the train stopped at Widley.<br />
But when it stopped at each station, he began to wonder why it was going so slowly.<br />
Finally, when the train reached Westhaven,<br />
	the writer spoke to the station master who denied the existence of an express.<br />
They argued and the writer was shown this timetable footnote,<br />
	which said: 'This service has been suspended'.<br />

When I finally boarded the train,<br />
	I was looking forward to a pleasant journey to the village of Slowleigh<br />
		where my friends live.<br />
I sat in my seat got out a book and was already reading when the train started.<br />
According to the timetable, the train was due to arrive in Slowleigh at 4.30.<br />
I had been so interested in my book that I had a shock when I looked at my watch.<br />
It was almost 4.30.<br />
I closed my book and waited for the train to slow down.<br />
It didn't.<br />
In fact, the train was going very fast -&#x2014;and that was Slowleigh, wasn't it?!<br />
The train went straight on.<br />
I asked the other passengers why the train hadn't stopped<br />
	and they told me it was the express to the city.<br />
</p>

<p>
I didn't believe it.<br />
Then the ticket collector came along.<br />
He looked at my ticket and I tried to explain,<br />
	but in the end I had to pay the full fare to the city.<br />
By the time we arrived in the city it was six o'clock.<br />
The journey had lasted two hours and I was miles away from my original destination.<br />
I rang my friends and said I would get a fast train back.<br />
Then checked the timetable: there was no fast train back to Slowleigh,<br />
	only a slow one, at 7 o'clock.<br />
By the time I finally reached Slowleigh Station,<br />
	it was nine o'clock at night.<br />
My pleasant little train journey had taken 4.5 hours!<br />
