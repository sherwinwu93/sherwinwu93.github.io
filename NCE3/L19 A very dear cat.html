<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8cf8c83">
<p class="verse">
Why was Rastus 'very dear' in more ways than one?<br />
<br />
Kidnappers are rarely interested in animals,<br />
&#xa0;but they recently took considerable interest in Mrs. Eleanor Ramsay's cat.<br />
Mrs. Eleanor Ramsay, a very wealthy old lady,<br />
&#xa0;has <b>shared a flat with</b> her cat, Rastus, for a great many years.<br />
Rastus leads an orderly life.<br />
He usually <b>takes a short walk</b> in the evenings and is always home by seven o'clock.<br />
One evening, however, he failed to arrive.<br />
Mrs. Ramsay <b>got very worried</b>.<br />
She looked everywhere for him but could not find him.<br />
<br />
Three days after Rastus' disappearance, Mrs. Ramsay received an anonymous letter.<br />
The writer stated that Rastus was in safe hands<br />
&#xa0;and would be returned immediately if Mrs. Ramsay paid a ransom of 1,000 dollars.<br />
Mrs. Ramsay was instructed to place the money in a cardboard box and to leave it outside her door.<br />
<b>At first</b>, she decided to <b>go to the police</b>,<br />
&#xa0;but fearing that she would never see Rastus again<br />
&#xa0;&#x2013; the letter had <b>made that quite clear</b> &#x2013;<br />
&#xa0;she <b>changed her mind</b>.<br />
She withdrew 1,000 dollars from her bank and followed the kidnapper's instructions.<br />
The next morning, the box had disappeared<br />
&#xa0;but Mrs. Ramsay was sure that the kidnapper would keep his word.<br />
<b>Sure enough</b>, Rastus arrived punctually at seven o'clock that evening.<br />
He looked very well, though he was rather thirsty, for he drank half a bottle of milk.<br />
The police were astounded when Mrs. Ramsay told them what she had done.<br />
<b>She explained that</b> Rastus <b>was very dear to</b> her.<br />
<b>Considering the amount</b> she paid, he was dear <b>in more ways than one</b>!<br />

Mrs. Ramsay received an anonymous letter three days after her cat's disappearance.<br />
The writer of the letter demanded $1000 for the return of the cat,<br />
	and warned that she would never see her cat again if she went to the police.<br />
She had to put the money in a cardboard box and leave it outside her door.<br />
After drawing $1000 from her bank, she acted on the kidnapper's instructions.<br />
The money disappeared the following morning,<br />
	and Rastus returned at seven o'clock that morning.<br />

<p>
In a bar one night, Mr. X was talking to a workman<br />
	who told him that he often worked in Mrs. Ramsay's flat.<br />
The workman added that Mrs. Ramsay was wealthy and she lived alone with her cat.<br />
Every day, Mr. X stood outside Mrs. Ramsay's block of flats.<br />
As the cat took a short walk every evening, he saw that it had regular habits.<br />
</p>

<p>
He found out as much as he could about Mrs. Ramsay and learnt that she loved this cat very much.<br />
One evening, as the cat was leaving the block of flats, he kidnapped it.<br />
He took the cat to a secret address.<br />
During the next three days, he walked past Mrs Ramsay's flat on several occasions<br />
	and noticed that no other cat ever appeared.<br />
Now he was sure he had the right cat, so he wrote a letter in which he stated his demands.<br />
