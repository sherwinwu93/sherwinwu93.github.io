What incident began the series of traffic accidents?<br />
<br />
We have all experienced days when everything goes wrong.<br />
A day may begin well enough, but suddenly everything seems to <b>get out of control</b>.<br />
<b>What invariably happens is</b><br />
&#xa0;that a great number of things choose to go wrong at precisely the same moment.<br />
It is as if a single unimportant event <b>set up a chain of reactions</b>.<br />
Let us suppose that you are preparing a meal and <b>keeping an eye on</b> the baby at the same time.<br />
The telephone rings and this marks <b>the prelude to an unforseen series of</b> catastrophes.<br />
While you <b>are on the phone</b>, the baby pulls the tablecloth off the table,<br />
&#xa0;smashing half your best crockery and cutting himself in the process.<br />
You <b>hang up</b> hurriedly and <b>attend to</b> baby, crockery, et cetera.<br />
Meanwhile, the meal gets burnt.<br />
As if this were not enough to <b>reduce you to tears</b>,<br />
&#xa0;your husband arrives, unexpectedly bringing three guests to dinner.<br />
<br />
Things can go wrong <b>on a big scale</b>,<br />
&#xa0;as a number of people recently discovered in Parramatta, <b>a suburb of Sydney</b>.<br />
During the <b>rush hour</b> one evening two cars collided and both drivers began to argue.<br />
The woman immediately behind the two cars happened to be a learner.<br />
She suddenly <b>got into a panic</b> and stopped her car.<br />
This made the driver following her brake hard.<br />
His wife was sitting beside him holding a large cake.<br />
As she was thrown forward, the cake went right through the windscreen and landed on the road.<br />
Seeing a cake flying through the air,<br />
&#xa0;a lorry driver who was <b>drawing up alongside</b> the car,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;<b>pulled up all of a sudden</b>.<br />
The lorry was loaded with empty beer bottles<br />
&#xa0;and hundreds of them <b>slid off</b> the back of the vehicle and on to the road.<br />
This led to yet another angry argument.<br />
Meanwhile, the traffic <b>piled up</b> behind.<br />
It took the police nearly an hour to <b>get the traffic on the move</b> again.<br />
In the meantime, the lorry driver had to <b>sweep up</b> hundreds of broken bottles.<br />
Only two <b>stray dogs benefited from</b> all this confusion,<br />
&#xa0;for they greedily devoured what was left of the cake.<br />
It was just one of those days!<br />

We have all experienced days when everything seems to go wrong.<br />
Things certainly went wrong for Ray, a friend of mine, one day last month.<br />
It all started as these things do, with a simple case of mistaken identity.<br />
Ray had been shopping and was loaded with parcels<br />
	when he got back to the multistory car park to look for his car.<br />
He knew he was on the correct level, but he couldn't see his car anywhere.<br />
Then, suddenly, while he was looking, he saw one exactly like it.<br />
It was a red Nissan.<br />
It was exactly the same as his own car, and naturally he mistook it for his own.<br />
Still holding the parcels, he felt in his jacket pockets and found his key.<br />
</p>

<p>
He tried to open the driver's door, but the key just wouldn't turn.<br />
He couldn't understand it.<br />
In the end, he forced the lock and naturally broke the key.<br />
At that point he dropped the parcels as well.<br />
This infuriated him.<br />
The only way he could get into his car was to break a window,<br />
	so he deliberately smashed the window of the car.<br />
As he was putting his hand in, the owner came back and saw him.<br />
The owner rushed towards Ray, held him against the car, and called a policeman on his mobile phone.<br />
When Ray was arrested, he tried to explain,<br />
	but the police did not believe him - until they found Ray's car on a level below!<br />
