* Lesson 33 A day to remember
#+begin_verse
What incident began the series of traffic accidents?

We have all experienced days when everything goes wrong.
A day may begin well enough, but suddenly everything seems to *get out of control*.
*What invariably happens is*
	that a great number of things choose to go wrong at precisely the same moment.
It is as if a single unimportant event *set up a chain of reactions*.
Let us suppose that you are preparing a meal and *keeping an eye on* the baby at the same time.
The telephone rings and this marks *the prelude to an unforseen series of* catastrophes.
While you *are on the phone*, the baby pulls the tablecloth off the table,
	smashing half your best crockery and cutting himself in the process.
You *hang up* hurriedly and *attend to* baby, crockery, et cetera.
Meanwhile, the meal gets burnt.
As if this were not enough to *reduce you to tears*,
	your husband arrives, unexpectedly bringing three guests to dinner.

Things can go wrong *on a big scale*,
	as a number of people recently discovered in Parramatta, *a suburb of Sydney*.
During the *rush hour* one evening two cars collided and both drivers began to argue.
The woman immediately behind the two cars happened to be a learner.
She suddenly *got into a panic* and stopped her car.
This made the driver following her brake hard.
His wife was sitting beside him holding a large cake.
As she was thrown forward, the cake went right through the windscreen and landed on the road.
Seeing a cake flying through the air,
	a lorry driver who was *drawing up alongside* the car,
		*pulled up all of a sudden*.
The lorry was loaded with empty beer bottles
	and hundreds of them *slid off* the back of the vehicle and on to the road.
This led to yet another angry argument.
Meanwhile, the traffic *piled up* behind.
It took the police nearly an hour to *get the traffic on the move* again.
In the meantime, the lorry driver had to *sweep up* hundreds of broken bottles.
Only two *stray dogs benefited from* all this confusion,
	for they greedily devoured what was left of the cake.
It was just one of those days!

We have all experienced days when everything seems to go wrong.
Things certainly went wrong for Ray, a friend of mine, one day last month.
It all started as these things do, with a simple case of mistaken identity.
Ray had been shopping and was loaded with parcels
	when he got back to the multistory car park to look for his car.
He knew he was on the correct level, but he couldn't see his car anywhere.
Then, suddenly, while he was looking, he saw one exactly like it.
It was a red Nissan.
It was exactly the same as his own car, and naturally he mistook it for his own.
Still holding the parcels, he felt in his jacket pockets and found his key.

He tried to open the driver's door, but the key just wouldn't turn.
He couldn't understand it.
In the end, he forced the lock and naturally broke the key.
At that point he dropped the parcels as well.
This infuriated him.
The only way he could get into his car was to break a window,
	so he deliberately smashed the window of the car.
As he was putting his hand in, the owner came back and saw him.
The owner rushed towards Ray, held him against the car, and called a policeman on his mobile phone.
When Ray was arrested, he tried to explain,
	but the police did not believe him - until they found Ray's car on a level below!
