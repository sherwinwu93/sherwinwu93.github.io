How did Hawkwood make money in times of peace?<br />
<br />
<b>There was a time<br />
&#xa0;when</b> the owners of shops and businesses in Chicago<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;had to <b>pay large sums of money to</b> gangsters in return for ‘protection’.<br />
If the money was not paid promptly,<br />
&#xa0;the gangsters would quickly <b>put a man out of business</b> by destroying his shop.<br />
Obtaining '<b>protection money</b>' is not a modern crime.<br />
<b>As long ago as</b> the fourteenth century,<br />
&#xa0;an Englishman, Sir John Hawkwood, <b>made the remarkable discovery</b><br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that people <b>would rather</b> pay large sums of money<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<b>than</b> have their life work destroyed by gangsters.<br />
<br />
Six hundred years ago,<br />
&#xa0;Sir John Hawkwood arrived in Italy with <b>a band of</b> soldiers and settled near Florence.<br />
He soon <b>made a name for himself</b> and <b>came to be known to the Italians as</b> Giovanni Acuto.<br />
Whenever the Italian city-states <b>were at war with</b> each other,<br />
&#xa0;Hawkwood used to hire his soldiers to princes<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;who were willing to pay the high price he demanded.<br />
<b>In times of peace</b>, when business was bad,<br />
&#xa0;Hawkwood and his men would march into a city-state and,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;after burning down a few farms,<br />
&#xa0;would <b>offer to go away</b> if protection money was paid to them.<br />
Hawkwood <b>made large sums of money</b> in this way.<br />
In spite of this, the Italians <b>regarded him as</b> a sort of hero.<br />
When he died at the age of eighty,<br />
&#xa0;the Florentines <b>gave him a state funeral</b><br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and had a picture painted which <b>was dedicated to the memory of</b><br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;'the most valiant soldier and most notable leader, Signor Giovanni Acuto'.<br />

After Sir John Hawkwood settled near Florence six hundred years ago ,<br />
	he hired soldiers to princes of city-states in times of war.<br />
In times of peace he threatened to destory a city-state unless the protection money was paid.<br />
In spite of this, the Italians regarded him as a sort of hero.<br />
When he died at the age of eighty,<br />
	the Florentins not only gave him a state funeral<br />
	but had a picture painted of him, deictaed to his memory.<br />

News that Hawkwood and his men were approaching<br />
	caused panic among villagers who prepared to defend their farms.<br />
Hawkwood had a bad reputation among farmers<br />
	because they knew he would not hesitate to kill them and to burn their farms.<br />
The farmers fought very hard, even though they were poorly armed.<br />
With their sticks and spades, they were no match for Hawkwood's well-armed soldiers<br />
	who had horses, swords and bows and arrows.<br />
During the battle, a great many farmers were killed.<br />
After Hawkwood destroyed their farms,<br />
	he sent a message to the prince of the city-state demanding a large amount of protection money.<br />
He said that if this money was paid, he would go away and cause no more trouble.<br />
However, if it wasn't paid, he would invade the city.<br />
To Hawkwood's amazement, this demand was refused, so he and his men invaded the city.<br />
As a result, many buildings were destroyed<br />
	and thousands of people were killed including quite a few of Hawkwood's soldiers.<br />
The city people fought very hard until Hawkwood and his men were finally driven off.<br />
Because the city people defended themselves so well,<br />
	Hawkwood never attacked them again.<br />
He and the prince even became friends.<br />
