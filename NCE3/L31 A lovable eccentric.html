<h2 id="orgdfe9c0c">Lesson 31 A lovable eccentric</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdfe9c0c">
<p class="verse">
Why did the shop assistant refuse to serve Dickie?<br />
<br />
True eccentrics never deliberately set out to <b>draw attention to themselves</b>.<br />
They <b>disregard social conventions</b><br />
&#xa0;without <b>being conscious that</b> they are doing anything extraordinary.<br />
This invariably <b>wins them</b> the love and respect of others,<br />
&#xa0;for they <b>add colour to</b> the dull <b>routine of everyday life</b>.<br />
<br />
<b>Up to the time of his death</b>, Richard Colson was one of the most notable figures in our town.<br />
He was a shrewd and wealthy businessman,<br />
&#xa0;but most people in the town hardly knew anything about this side of his life.<br />
He was known to us all as Dickie and his eccentricity had become legendary long before he died.<br />
<br />
Dickie disliked snobs intensely.<br />
Though he owned a large car, he hardly ever used it, perferring always to <b>go on foot</b>.<br />
Even when it was raining heavily, he refused to carry an umbrella.<br />
One day, he walked into an expensive shop after having <b>been caught in</b> a particularly heavy shower.<br />
He wanted to buy a 300 dollars watch for his wife,<br />
&#xa0;but he was in such a bedraggled condition that an assistant refused to serve him.<br />
Dickie left the shop without a word and returned carrying a large cloth bag.<br />
As it was extremely heavy, he <b>dumped it on the counter</b>.<br />
The assistant asked him to leave,<br />
&#xa0;but Dickie paid no attention to him and <b>requested to</b> see the manager.<br />
Recognizing who the customer was,<br />
&#xa0;the manager was most apologetic and reprimanded the assistant severely.<br />
When Dickie was given the watch, he <b>presented the asssistant with</b> the cloth bag.<br />
It contained 300 dollars in cents.<br />
He insisted on the assistant's counting the money before he left &#x2013; 30000 cents in all!<br />
On another occasion,<br />
&#xa0;he <b>invited a number of important critics to see</b> his private collection of modern paintings.<br />
This exhibition received a great deal of attention in the press,<br />
&#xa0;for though the pictures were supposed to be the work of famous artists,<br />
&#xa0;they had in fact been painted by Dickie.<br />
It took him four years to stage this <b>elaborate joke</b><br />
&#xa0;simply to prove that critics do not always know what they are talking about.<br />

Mr. Chew is a man who has lived in our small town for years.<br />
He is a large man (some would say 'fat'),<br />
	he has a round face, a big black moustache and a bald head.<br />
He always wears the same clothes &#x2013; black trousers, a white shirt and a red waistcoat,<br />
	and is always polite to everyone he meets.<br />
He owns an antiques shop near the river, and he lives 'over the shop'.<br />
No one knows where he gets his things,<br />
	but there are always lots of different interesting antiques in the shop window every week.<br />
Mr. Chew is interested in politics, too.<br />
Every week he puts up strange notices in his shop window to passers-by.<br />
</p>

<p>
Usually the notices are trying to make people<br />
	save a local building or stop a plan to build a road through the town.<br />
Every time there is a national election,<br />
	he automatically stands for parliament<br />
	and gives speeches almost every day in the town park<br />
	saying what he would do if he were Prime Minister.<br />
He usually says he would make sure that antiques dealers did not have to pay income Tax<br />
	and that no cars should be allowed into our little town at all.<br />
Every year he gets a few votes,<br />
	but not enough to worry the serious candidates.<br />
For most people Mr. Chew is a harmless eccentric,<br />
	and everyone likes talking to him.<br />
After all, he is someone who adds colour to the dull routine of their daily lives.<br />
