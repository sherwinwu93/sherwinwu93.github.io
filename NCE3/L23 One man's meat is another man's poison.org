* Lesson 23 One man's meat is another man's poison 
#+begin_verse
What was it about snails that made the writer collect them for his friend on that day in particular?

People become quite illogical when they try to decide what can be eaten and what cannot be eaten.
If you lived in the Mediterranean, *for instance*, you would consider octopus a great delicacy.
You would not be able to understand why some people find it repulsive.
On the other hand, your stomach would turn at the idea of frying potatoes in animal fat
	-- the normally accepted practice in many northern countries.
*The sad truth is that* most of us have *been brought up to eat* certain foods
	and we *stick to them* all our lives.

No creature has *received more praise and abuse than* the common garden snail.
Cooked in wine, snails are a great luxury in various parts of the world.
There are countless people
	who, ever since their early years, have learned to *associate snails with food*.
My friend, Robert, lives in a country where snails are despised.
As his flat is in a large town, he has no garden of his own.
For years he has been asking me to collect snails from my garden and take them to him.
The idea never *appealed to me* very much, but one day, *after a heavy shower*,
	I happened to be walking in my garden
		when I *noticed* a huge number of snails *taking a stroll* on some of my prize plants.
Acting on a sudden impulse,
	I collected several dozen, put them in a paper bag, and took them to Robert.
Robert *was delighted to see* me and equally pleased with my little gift.
I left the bag in the hall
	and Robert and I went into the living room where we talked for a couple of hours.
I had forgotten all about the snails when Robert suddenly said that I must *stay to dinner*.
Snails would, of course, be the main dish.
I did not fancy the idea and I reluctantly followed Robert out of the room.
*To our dismay*, we saw that there were snails everywhere:
	they had escaped from the paper bag and had *taken complete possession of* the hall!
I have never been able to look at a snail since then.

I took the snails to Robert.
I left the bag in the hall and Robert
	and I had been talking in the living room for a couple of hours.
After Robert asked me to stay to dinner,
	we went out of the room finding the snails taking possession of the hall.
Since then, I have never been able to look at a snail.

The writer collected several dozen snails,
	put them in a paper bag and took them to Robert

The writer left the bag in the hall
	and he and Robert went into the living room and talked for a couple of hours.
He had forgotten the snails until Robert invited him to dinner,
	and he followed Robert into the hall to find snails everywhere.
They had escaped from the bag.

The snails had escaped from the paper bag and they were everywhere
	----on the walls, on the ceiling, on the carpet, and even on the large hall mirror.
When we began to look carefully, we found that they were even in coat pockets in the clothes
	hanging on the clothes hooks in the hall.
It was disgusting!
Snails move slowly but it's amazing how far they can travel in a couple of hours!
It took Robert and me ages to collect them.
He fetched a pair of steps for me and ladders for himself and we collected them in two buckets.

There were snail marks everywhere, too, and it took hours to clear up the mess
	----remember, there were several dozen of them.
Snails may not be fast, but we had been talking for a couple of hours,
	and they can travel.
Even now I am sure we didn't find them all: some are still crawling round Robert's house.
The ones that we did not find were lucky!
Robert was amused, but I wasn't.
He decided to cook the snails and invited me to stay.
I said before that I didn't fancy the idea, so I left him to his meal for one.
I just couldn't look at the snails and have never been able to face them since then.
