* Lesson 01 A puma at large
#+begin_verse
Where must the puma have come from?

Puma are large, cat-like animals which *are found in* America.
When reports came into London Zoo
		that a wild puma had been spotted forty-five miles south of London,
	they *were not taken seriously*.
However, as the evidence began to accumulate,
	experts from the Zoo *felt obliged to investigate*,
	for the descriptions given by people who *claimed to have seen* the puma
		were extraordinarily similar.

The hunt for the puma began in a small village
	where a woman picking blackberries saw 'a large cat' only five yards away from her.
It immediately ran away when she saw it,
	and experts *confirmed that* a puma will not attack a human being unless it is cornered.
The search *proved difficult*,
	for the puma was often observed at one place in the morning
		and at another place twenty miles away in the evening.
Wherever it went, it left behind it *a trail of* dead deer and small animals like rabbits.
Paw prints were seen in a number of places and puma fur *was found clinging to bushes*.
Several people complained of 'cat-like noises' at night
	and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree.
*The experts were now fully convinced that* the animal was a puma,
	but where had it come from?
As no pumas had been reported missing from any zoo in the country,
	this one must have been in the possession of a private collector
		and somehow managed to escape.
The hunt *went on* for several weeks,
	but the puma was not caught.
*It is disturbing to think*
	that a dangerous wild animal is still *at large* in the quiet countryside.

Mrs. Stone had spent the whole morning picking blackberries in the countryside near her home.
It was nearly lunch time, so she decided to return for lunch.
She was just picking up her basket when she heard a noise in the bushes.
Then she saw an animal which looked like a cat.
She knew it was not a cat because it was so large.
The animal suddenly turned round to look at her
	and she thought it was going to come towards her and perhaps attack her.
She dropped her basket and screamed loudly.
Hearing the sound, the animal disappeared into the bushes,
	after which Mr. Stone picked up her basket and ran all the way home.
She told her neighbours that she had seen a puma in the countryside,
	but they did not believe her.
She also telephoned the police but they didn't believe her either.
