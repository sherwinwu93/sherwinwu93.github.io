How did Mr. Taylor try to stop the thieves?<br />
<br />
The expensive shops in a famous arcade near Piccadilly were just opening.<br />
At this time of morning, the arcade was almost empty.<br />
Mr. Taylor, the owner of a jewellery shop was admiring a new window display.<br />
Two of his assistants had been working busily since eight o'clock and had <b>only just</b> finished.<br />
Diamond necklaces and rings had been beautifully arranged on a background of black velvet.<br />
After gazing at the display for several minutes, Mr. Taylor went back into his shop.<br />
<br />
The silence was suddenly broken<br />
&#xa0;when a large car, with its headlights on and its horn blaring, roared down the arcade.<br />
It <b>came to a stop</b> outside the jeweller's.<br />
One man stayed at the wheel<br />
&#xa0;while two others with black stockings over their faces<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;jumped out and smashed the window of the shop with iron bars.<br />
While this was going on, Mr. Taylor was upstairs.<br />
He and his staff began throwing furniture out of the window.<br />
Chairs and tables went flying into the arcade.<br />
One of the thieves was struck by a heavy statue,<br />
&#xa0;but he was <b>too busy helping himself to diamonds to</b> notice any pain.<br />
The raid was all over in three minutes,<br />
&#xa0;for the men scrambled back into the car<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and it moved off <b>at a fantastic speed</b>.<br />
Just as it was leaving,<br />
&#xa0;Mr. Taylor rushed out and ran after it throwing ashtrays and vases,<br />
&#xa0;but it was impossible to stop the thieves.<br />
They had got away with <b>thousands of pounds worth of diamonds</b>.<br />

A large car entered an arcade near Piccadilly<br />
	and stopped outside a jeweller's.<br />
Two thieves got out of the car<br />
	and smashed the shop window.<br />
The owner of the shop was upstairs at the time,<br />
	so he threw furniture at the thieves<br />
		hitting one of them with a heavy statue.<br />
The raid lasted only three minutes and the thieves drove away.<br />
Running after them, the owner threw ashtrays and vases,<br />
	but the thieves got away, stealing thousands of pounds worth of diamonds.<br />

Seeing the thieves' car join the traffic on Piccadilly,<br />
	Mr. Taylor took a taxi and followed them.<br />
The taxi driver drove at full speed when Mr. Taylor told him what had happened.<br />
There wasn't too much traffic at this time of the morning<br />
	so there was a mad chase through the streets of London.<br />
For a short time, the thieves' car was on the wrong side of the road and hit another car,<br />
	but it did not stop.<br />
Two policemen in a police car watched in amazement as the two vehicles went past,<br />
	both breaking the speed limit.<br />
Lights on and horn blaring,<br />
	the police car chased both the speeding cars.<br />
Mr. Taylor's taxi stopped when the traffic lights turned red.<br />
The thieves ignored the traffic lights and got away.<br />
Meanwhile, the police caught up with the taxi at the traffic lights<br />
	and the taxi driver was charged with speeding.<br />
They refused to let the driver off, even though Mr.Taylor carefully explained the situation.<br />
However, the police informed another police car of the chase<br />
	and ten minutes later the thieves' car was found abandoned in a side street.<br />
The thieves had escaped on foot and disappeared among the crowd.<br />
