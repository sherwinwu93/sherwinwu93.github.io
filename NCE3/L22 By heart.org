* Lesson 22 By heart
#+begin_verse
Which actor read the letter in the end, the aristocrat or the jailer?

Some plays are so successful that they run *for years on end*.
*In many ways*, this is unfortunate for the poor actors
	who *are required to go* on repeating the same lines night after night.
One would *expect them to know their parts by heart* and never *have cause to* falter.
Yet this is not always the case.

A famous actor in a highly successful play *was once cast in the role of* an aristocrat
	who had been imprisoned in the Bastille for twenty years.
In the last act, a jailer would always come on to the stage with a letter
	which he would hand to the prisoner.
Even though the noble was expected to read the letter at each performance,
	he always *insisted that it should be written out in full*.

One night, the jailer decided to *play a joke on* his colleague to find out
	if, after so many performances, he had managed to learn the contents of the letter by heart.
*The curtain went up* on the final act of the play
	and revealed the aristocrat sitting alone behind bars in his dark cell.
Just then, the jailer appeared with the precious letter in his hands.
He entered the cell and *presented the letter to* the aristocrat.
But the copy he gave him had not been written out in full as usual.
It was simply *a blank sheet of paper*.
The jailer *looked on* eagerly, *anxious to see* if his fellow actor had *at last* learnt his lines.
The noble *stared at* the blank sheet of paper for a few seconds.
Then, squinting his eyes, he said: 'The light is dim. Read the letter to me.'
And he promptly handed the sheet of paper to the jailer.
Finding that he could not remember a word of the letter either,
	the jailer replied: 'The light is indeed dim, sire. I must get my glasses.'
With this, he hurried off the stage.
*Much to the aristocrat's amusement*,
	the jailer returned a few moments later
		with a pair of glasses and the usual copy of the letter
			which he *proceeded to read to the prisoner*.

A couple of years ago, a new play called The World Tomorrow
	was going to be shown in our local theatre.
There was a great deal of advertising for it
	and there was considerable public interest,
	mainly, I think, because the cast contained a number of famous actors and actresses.
Most actors and actresses are usually nervous on the first night of any play,
	and no one really knows what can go wrong or how the audience will react.
In the case of The World Tomorrow, no one forgot their lines,
	but the play was not well received.
It was a comedy, so it was supposed to be funny,
	but nobody laughed----not in the right places anyway ----
	and people even walked out before the end.

The cast suspected that they would get bad reviews the following day, and they did.
One review described it as 'the saddest comedy I've ever seen':
	another thought it was
		'the most professionally acted disaster we have ever seen on our local stage'
In spite of the reviews, however, the play still ran for six weeks.
The last performance, on the last Saturday evening, attracted a small audience,
	and the actors struggled through to the end.
At the end of six terrible weeks, however, there was one final moment of relief.
When the last line was spoken:
	'Our six short weeks have hastened to their end,
		the audience saw the funny side of it and laughed.
		Even the actors and actresses laughed.
