<h2 id="org795a89e">Lesson 09 Flying cats</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org795a89e">
<p class="verse">
How do cats try to protect themselves when falling from great heights?<br />
<br />
Cats never fail to fascinate human beings.<br />
They can be friendly and affectionate towards humans,<br />
&#xa0;but they <b>lead mysterious lives</b> of their own as well.<br />
They never become submissive like dogs and horses.<br />
As a result, humans have learned to respect feline independence.<br />
Most cats remain suspicious of humans all their lives.<br />
One of the things that fascinates us most about cats is the popular belief<br />
&#xa0;that they have nine lives.<br />
Apparently, there is <b>a good deal of</b> truth in this idea.<br />
A cat's ability to survive falls <b>is based on</b> fact.<br />
<br />
Recently<br />
&#xa0;the New York Animal Medical Centre <b>made a study of</b> 132 cats over <b>a period of</b> five months.<br />
All these cats <b>had one experience in common</b>:<br />
&#xa0;they had fallen off high buildings, yet only eight of them <b>died from</b> shock or injuries.<br />
Of course, New York is the ideal place for such an interesting study,<br />
&#xa0;because <b>there is no shortage of</b> tall buildings.<br />
There are plenty of high-rise windowsills to fall from!<br />
One cat, Sabrina, fell 32 storeys, yet only suffered from a broken tooth.<br />
'Cats behave like well-trained paratroopers,' a doctor said.<br />
<b>It seems that</b> the further cats fall, the less they <b>are likely to</b> injure themseleves.<br />
In a long drop, they reach speeds of 60 miles an hour and more.<br />
At high speeds, falling cats have time to relax.<br />
They stretch out their legs like flying squirrels.<br />
This increases their air-resistance and reduces the shock of impact when they hit the groud.<br />

The New York Animal Medical Center made a study of 132 cats.<br />
All these cats had fallen off high buildings,<br />
	yet only eight of them died from shock or injuries.<br />
One cat, Sabrina, fell 32 storeys but only suffered from a broken tooth.<br />
When falling at speeds of 60 miles an hour, cats stretch out their legs,<br />
	which increases air-resistence and reduces the shock of impact on hitting the ground.<br />

Human beings like to keep dogs and cats.<br />
Dogs are submissive and faithful to their masters, but cats like to be independent.<br />
Cats are especially lovable when they are still kittens.<br />
As kittens they like to play by chasing anything that moves.<br />
That's how they learn to hunt mice, birds, insects and other small creatures.<br />
A lot of people keep cats so they can have a pet.<br />
As kittens grow into cats, they like to stay indoors.<br />
They like regular meals and enjoy sleeping in front of a nice fire.<br />
However, they also like going out.<br />
During the day time and at night they like to go hunting.<br />
Sometimes during the night they have fights with other cats.<br />
Cats are very clean animals.<br />
You often see them washing themselves.<br />
Human beings are fascinated by their behaviour because cats are domestic animals,<br />
	while at the same time they enjoy their independence.<br />
