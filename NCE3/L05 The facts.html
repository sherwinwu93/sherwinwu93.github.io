<p class="verse">
What was the consequence of the editor's insistence on facts and statistics?<br />
<br />
Editors of newspapers and magazines often <b>go to extremes</b><br />
&#xa0;to <b>provide their readers with</b> unimportant facts and statistics.<br />
Last year a journalist had <b>been instructed by</b> a well-known magazine<br />
&#xa0;to <b>write an article on</b> the president's palace in a new African republic.<br />
When the article arrived, the editor read the first sentence and then refused to publish it.<br />
The article began: 'Hundreds of steps lead to the high wall which surrounds the president's palace.'<br />
The editor at once sent the journalist a fax<br />
&#xa0;instructing him to <b>find out</b> the exact number of steps and the height of the wall.<br />
<br />
The journalist immediately set out to obtain these important facts,<br />
&#xa0;but he <b>took a long time to send</b> them.<br />
Meanwhile, the editor was <b>getting impatient</b>, for the magazine would soon <b>go to press</b>.<br />
He sent the journalist two more faxes, but received no reply.<br />
He sent yet another fax informing the journalist that if he did not reply soon he would <b>be fired</b>.<br />
When the journalist again failed to reply,<br />
&#xa0;the editor reluctantly <b>published the article</b> as it had originally been written.<br />
A week later, the editor at last received a fax from the journalist.<br />
Not only had the poor man been arrested, but he had been sent to prison as well.<br />
However, he had at last been allowed to <b>send a fax</b><br />
&#xa0;in which he <b>informed the editor</b><br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that he had been arrested<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;while counting the 1084 steps<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;leading to the fifteen-foot wall which surrounded the president's palace.<br />

Though the journalist immediately set out to get the facts<br />
		after receiving the instructions from his editor,<br />
	he didn't send them at once.<br />
Meanwhile, the editor was getting impatient,<br />
	so he sent three faxes,<br />
	finally threatening to fire him.<br />
When the last fax wasn't answered, the article was printed in its original form.<br />
The journalist at last sent a fax a week later<br />
	explaining that he had been imprisoned<br />
		because of counting the steps and measuring the height of the wall.<br />

The journalist counted the number of steps<br />
	as he wearily climbed up to the high wall surrounding the president's palace.<br />
On arriving at the main gate, he sat down to get his breath back.<br />
He then produced a tape measure in order to measure the wall.<br />
While he was busy measuring the wall,<br />
	a policeman approached him and asked him what he was doing.<br />
Though the journalist explained<br />
	he was a reporter and his editor had asked him to find out the exact height of the wall,<br />
	the policeman refused to believe him.<br />
He was arrested and sent to prison<br />
	because the police though that he might be a spy<br />
		or might even want to assassinate the president.<br />
When the journalist insisted he was innocent,<br />
	he made things worse for himself.<br />
This proved to the police<br />
	that the man certainly was guilty and deserved to stay in prison indefinitely.<br />
