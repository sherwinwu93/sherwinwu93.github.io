<h2 id="org6442fb0">Lesson 35 Justice was done</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6442fb0">
<p class="verse">
The word 'justice' is given two different meanings in the text.<br />
What is the distinction between them?<br />
<br />
The word justice is usually associated with <b>courts of law</b>.<br />
We might say<br />
&#xa0;that <b>justice has been done</b> when a man's <b>innocence or guilt has been proved beyond doubt</b>.<br />
Justice is part of the complex machinery of the law.<br />
Those who seek it <b>undertake an arduous journey</b> and can never be sure that they will find it.<br />
Judges, <b>however</b> wise or eminent, are human and can <b>make mistakes</b>.<br />
<br />
<b>There are rare instances when</b> justice almost <b>ceases to be</b> an <b>abstract concept</b>.<br />
Reward or punishment are <b>meted out</b> quite <b>independent of human interference</b>.<br />
At such times, justice acts like a living force.<br />
When we use a phrase like 'it serves him right',<br />
&#xa0;we are, <b>in part</b>, admitting<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that a certain set of circumstances has enabled justice to act <b>of its own accord</b>.<br />
<br />
When a thief was caught <b>on the premises of</b> a large jewelery store one morning,<br />
&#xa0;the shop assistants must have found it impossible to resist the temptation<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;to say 'it serves him right.'<br />
The shop was an old converted house with many large, disused fireplaces and tall, narrow chimneys.<br />
Towards midday, a girl heard a muffled cry coming from behind one of the walls.<br />
As the cry was repeated several times,<br />
&#xa0;she <b>ran to tell</b> the manager who promptly <b>rang up</b> the fire brigade.<br />
The cry had certainly come from one of the chimneys,<br />
&#xa0;but as there were so many of them, the fire fighters could not be certain which one it was.<br />
They located the right chimney by <b>tapping at</b> the walls and <b>listening for</b> the man's cries.<br />
After chipping through a wall which was eighteen inches thick,<br />
&#xa0;they found that a man had been trapped in the chimney.<br />
As it was extremely narrow, the man <b>was unable to</b> move,<br />
&#xa0;but the fire fighters were eventually able to free him by cutting a huge hole in the wall.<br />
The sorry-looking, blackened figure that emerged,<br />
&#xa0;admitted at once that he had tried to <b>break into</b> the shop during the night<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;but had got stuck in the chimney.<br />
He had been there for nearly ten hours.<br />
Justice had been done even before the man <b>was handed over to</b> the police.<br />

<p>
There is a large jewellery store in the town that I have often wanted to rob.<br />
A few weeks ago I started planning the theft and kept a close watch on the shop.<br />
I noticed when people went in and out, when they started and finished work, and so on.<br />
And I noticed the chimneys, too.<br />
One night I climbed onto the roof of the store and looked for a way in.<br />
One of the chimneys seemed wide enough for me to get in, so I started climbing down.<br />
Very soon, however, I got stuck and had to climb out again.<br />
I didn't give up.<br />
I looked around, found another chimney that looked quite wide at the top and climbed down that one.<br />
Again I got stuck.<br />
</p>

<p>
This time, however, I was really stuck.<br />
I could climb neither up nor down.<br />
At first I struggled to try to free myself, but I couldn't get out.<br />
Then I started to get scared and started sweating.<br />
I tried to calm myself by quietly counting and thinking of pleasant things.<br />
But nothing worked and finally l started shouting for help.<br />
Nothing happened, everything was dark and silent, and I got more and more frightened.<br />
I think I went to sleep because I suddenly realized that light was shining down the chimney.<br />
I shouted and shouted.<br />
Eventually I heard tapping and was finally freed by fire fighters<br />
	who had smashed a hole in the chimney.<br />
