* Lesson 02 Thirteen equals one
#+begin_verse
Was the vicar pleased that the clock was striking? Why?

Our vicar is always raising money *for one cause or another*,
	but he has never managed to *get enough money to have* the church clock repaired.
The big clock which used to strike the hours day and night
	was damaged many years ago and has been silent ever since.

One night, however, our vicar *woke up with a start*:
	the clock was striking the hours!
Looking at his watch, he saw that it was one o'clock,
	but the bell struck thirteen times before it stopped.
*Armed with a torch*, the vicar went up into the clock tower to see *what was going on*.
In the torchlight, he *caught sight of a figure*
	whom he immediately *recognized as Bill Wilkins*, our local grocer.

'Whatever are you doing up here Bill?' asked the vicar in surprise.

'I'm trying to repair the bell,' answered Bill.
'I've been coming up here night after night for weeks now.
You see, I was hoping to *give you a surprise*.'

'You certainly did give me a surprise!' said the vicar.
'You've probably woken up everyone in the village as well.
Still, *I'm glad* the bell is working again.'

'That's the trouble, vicar,' answered Bill.
'It's working all right, but I'm afraid that
	at one o'clock it will strike thirteen times and there's nothing I can do about it.'

'We'll *get used to that*, Bill,' said the vicar.
'Thirteen is not as good as one, but it's better than nothing.
Now let's go downstairs and have a cup of tea.'

We were used to hearing our church bell striking the hours in our small village.
For as long as anyone could remember, the bell had struck the hours day and night.
However, one night the church bell remained silent
	and the next morning we saw that the clock had stopped at exactly one a.m.
Our clock was clearly damaged, but no one could explain how this had happened.
Armed with a torch, our vicar climbed into the church tower to see what was going on.
He heard a loud buzz
	as he went towards the clock and in the torchlight he found it had been invaded by bees.
He was lucky they didn't sting him!
He shone his torch into the great bell and saw that it was full of wax and honey.
No wonder it wasn't working!
A bee keeper was called in to deal with the situation.
He immediately removed the queen bee to one of his bee hives and the other bees followed.
The clock was cleaned and was soon working again.
We not only enjoyed hearing it strike the hours day and nigt,
	but we enjoyed eating the honey as well.
