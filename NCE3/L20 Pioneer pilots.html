What was the name of the first plane to fly across the English Channel?<br />
<br />
In 1908 Lord Northcliffe <b>offered a prize of 1,000 dollars to the first man</b><br />
&#xa0;who would fly across the English Channel.<br />
Over a year passed before the first <b>attempt was made</b>.<br />
On July 19th, 1909, in the early morning,<br />
&#xa0;Hubert Latham took off from the French coast in his plane the 'Antoinette IV'.<br />
He had travelled only seven miles across the Channel<br />
&#xa0;when his engine failed and he <b>was forced to</b> land on the sea.<br />
The 'Antoinette' floated on the water until Latham <b>was picked up by</b> a ship.<br />
<br />
Two days later, Louis Bleriot arrived near Calais with a plane called 'No. XI'.<br />
Bleriot had been making planes since 1905 and this was his latest model.<br />
A week before, he had completed a successful overland flight<br />
&#xa0;during which he covered twenty-six miles.<br />
Latham, however, did not give up easily.<br />
He, too, arrived near Calais <b>on the same day</b> with a new 'Antoinette'.<br />
<b>It looked as if</b> there would be an exciting race across the Channel.<br />
Both planes were going to take off on July 25th, but Latham failed to get up early enough.<br />
After making a short test flight at 4.15 a.m., Bleriot set off half an hour later.<br />
His great flight lasted thirty-seven minutes.<br />
When he landed near Dover, the first person to greet him was a local policeman.<br />
Latham made another attempt a week later and got within half a mile of Dover,<br />
&#xa0;but he was unlucky again.<br />
His engine failed and he landed on the sea for the second time.<br />

It was early morning.<br />
I looked around, but there was no sign of Latham, so l decided to go on a test flight first.<br />
At 4.15, I took off and flew over Calais for fifteen minutes.<br />
When I landed there was still no sign of Latham.<br />
At 4.45 I took off again.<br />
This time I was determined to fly across the Channel.<br />
When I looked down there was no sign of the ship below,<br />
	which was supposed to be following me,<br />
	I suddenly felt alone and was worried whether I was flying in the right direction.<br />
All I could see was sea and sky.<br />
</p>

<p>
I could feel the high winds against the plane and the engine got very hot.<br />
Fortunately, it began to rain and the rain cooled my engine.<br />
Suddenly, I could see land ahead.<br />
Dover! I flew over Dover, looking for somewhere to land.<br />
I saw a field below and brought the plane down.<br />
I was still sitting in the cockpit,<br />
	hardly able to believe the flight was so successful<br />
	&#x2013; just thirty-seven minutes to cross from Calais &#x2013;<br />
	when a British policeman arrived.<br />
He smiled broadly at me and said,'Good morning!<br />
I smiled back and said, 'Bonjour!'<br />
