<h2 id="org61303e9">Lesson 16 Mary had a little lamb</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org61303e9">
<p class="verse">
Was Dimitri right to apologize to his neighbour? Why not?<br />
<br />
Mary and her husband Dimitri lived in the tiny village of Perachora in southern Greece.<br />
One of Mary's prize possessions was a little white lamb which her husband had given her.<br />
She kept it <b>tied to a tree</b> in a field during the day and went to fetch it every evening.<br />
One evening, however, the lamb was missing.<br />
The rope had been cut, so it was obvious that the lamb had been stolen.<br />
<br />
When Dimitri came in from the fields, his wife told him what had happened.<br />
Dimitri at once set out to find the thief.<br />
He knew it would not prove difficult in such a small village.<br />
After <b>telling several of his friends about the theft</b>,<br />
&#xa0;Dimitri found out that his neighbour, Aleko, had suddenly acquired a new lamb.<br />
Dimitri immediately went to Aleko's house and angrily <b>accused him of stealing</b> the lamb.<br />
He told him he had better return it or he would call the police.<br />
Aleko <b>denied taking</b> it and led Dimitri into his backyard.<br />
<b>It was true that</b> he had just bought a lamb, he explained, <b>but</b> his lamb was black.<br />
<b>Ashamed of having acted</b> so rashly, Dimitri <b>apologized to Aleko for having accused</b> him.<br />
While they were talking<br />
&#xa0;it began to rain and Dimitri stayed in Aleko's house until the rain stopped.<br />
When he went outside half an hour later,<br />
&#xa0;he <b>was astonished to find that</b> the little black lamb was almost white.<br />
Its wool, which had <b>been dyed black</b>, had been washed clean by the rain!<br />

Dimitri was surprised to find that the lamb had turned white.<br />
He took a close look at it and recognized it as his own.<br />
This discovery immediately led to an angry scene between Dimitri and Aleko.<br />
Dimitri repeated his accusation that Aleko had stolen the lamb,<br />
	but Aleko still denied any theft.<br />
During the violent argument,<br />
	Dimitri said the rain had proved that the lamb had been dyed black<br />
		and he recognized it immediately as the one he had given to his wife.<br />
When Aleko finally admitted he had stolen the lamb, Dimitri called the police.<br />
Aleko was arrested and Dimitri took his lamb home.<br />
The story caused a lot of excitement in the village.<br />
The villagers didn't often have the opportunity to talk about such an important event<br />
	and they were greatly amused by what had happened.<br />
Some thought Aleko had been very clever.<br />
Others thought he had been extremely stupid.<br />
Others said God had sent the rain to punish Aleko for his crime<br />
	and to prove he was a thief.<br />
They discussed the event at great length for a long time,<br />
	as there wasn't much else to talk about in a village<br />
		where nothing much ever happened.<br />
