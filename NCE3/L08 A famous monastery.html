<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9471734">
<p class="verse">
What are the St. Bernard dogs used for?<br />
<br />
The Great St. Benard Pass <b>connects Switerland to Italy</b>.<br />
At 2,473 metres, it is the highest mountain pass in Europe.<br />
The famous monastery of St. Bernard, which was founded in the eleventh century,<br />
&#xa0;lies about a mile away.<br />
<b>For hundreds of years</b>,<br />
&#xa0;St. Bernard dogs have saved the lives of travellers crossing the dangerous Pass.<br />
These friendly dogs, which were first brought from Asia,<br />
&#xa0;were used as watchdogs even in Roman times.<br />
<b>Now that</b> a tunnel has been build through the mountains, the Pass is less dangerous,<br />
&#xa0;but each year, the dogs are still sent out into the snow whenever a traveller <b>is in difficulty</b>.<br />
Despite the new tunnel, there are still a few people who rashly <b>attempt to cross</b> the Pass on foot.<br />
<br />
During the summer months, the monastery is very busy,<br />
&#xa0;for it is visited by thousands of people who cross the Pass in cars.<br />
As there are so many people about, the dogs have to be kept in a special enclosure.<br />
In winter, however, life at the monastery is quite different.<br />
The temperature drops to minus 30 degrees and very few people attempt to cross the Pass.<br />
The monks prefer winter to summer for they have more privacy.<br />
The dogs have greater freedom, too,<br />
&#xa0;for they are allowed to wander outside their enclosure.<br />
The only regular visitors to the monastery in winter are parties of skier<br />
&#xa0;who go there at Christmas and Easter.<br />
These young people, who love the peace of the mountains,<br />
&#xa0;always <b>receive a warm welcome</b> at St. Bernard's monastery.<br />

One very cold morning, a monk took two St. Bernard's dogs out for exercise.<br />
He immediately noticed that the dogs were very restless.<br />
Suspecting at traveller might be in difficulty,<br />
	the monk returned to the monastery to organize a search party.<br />
The two dogs led four monks through the snow.<br />
Two of the monks pulled a sledge behind them, in case they needed it.<br />
There had been very high winds the previous night,<br />
	but now everything was still and visibility was bad because there was a heavy fog.<br />
Moreover, the temperature had fallen to -20 degrees.<br />
The dogs led the monks towards the Pass and as the monks got near,<br />
	they heard cries in the distance.<br />
The dogs soon found a man who was trapped under the snow and immediately dragged him out.<br />
The man was alive, but frozen stiff.<br />
The monks strapped him to the sledge and took him back to the monastery.<br />
The man was unconscious, but he soon recovered in the warm atmosphere of the monastery<br />
	where he was given plenty of hot drinks and food.<br />
When the traveller was able to speak,<br />
	the monks listened with interest<br />
		as he told them what had happened the previous night.<br />
