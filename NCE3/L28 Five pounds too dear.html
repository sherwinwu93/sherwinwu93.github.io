<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2a38424">
<p class="verse">
Why was even five pounds 'too dear'?<br />
<br />
Small boats loaded with wares <b>sped to the great liner</b> as she was entering the harbour.<br />
Before she had anchored,<br />
&#xa0;the men from the boats had climbed on board<br />
&#xa0;and the decks were soon covered with colourful rugs from Persia,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;silks from India, copper coffee pots, and beautiful handmade silverware.<br />
It was difficult not to be tempted.<br />
Many of the tourists on board had begun <b>bargaining with the tradesmen</b>,<br />
&#xa0;but I decided not to buy anything until I had disembarked.<br />
<br />
I had no sooner got off the ship than I <b>was assailed by a man</b><br />
&#xa0;who wanted to sell me a diamond ring.<br />
I <b>had no intention of</b> buying one,<br />
&#xa0;but I <b>could not conceal the fact that</b> I <b>was impressed by</b> the size of the diamonds.<br />
Some of them were as big as marbles.<br />
The man <b>went to great lengths to prove that</b> the diamonds were real.<br />
As we were walking past a shop,<br />
&#xa0;he held a diamond firmly against the window and made a deep impression in the glass.<br />
It took me over half an hour to <b>get rid of him</b>.<br />
<br />
The next man to approach me was selling expensive pens and watches.<br />
I examined one of the pens closely.<br />
It certainly looked genuine.<br />
<b>At the base of the gold cap</b>, the words 'made in the USA' had been neatly inscribed.<br />
The man said that the pen was worth 50 dollars,<br />
&#xa0;but <b>as a special favour</b>, he would <b>let me have it</b> for 30 dollars.<br />
I shook my head and held up five fingers <b>indicating that</b> I was willing to pay 5 dollars.<br />
Gesticulating wildly, the man acted as if he found my offer outrageous,<br />
&#xa0;but he eventually <b>reduced the price to 10 dollars</b>.<br />
Shrugging my shoulders,<br />
&#xa0;I began to walk away when, a moment later, he ran after me and <b>thrust the pen into</b> my hands.<br />
Though he kept <b>throwing up his arms</b> in despair, he readily accepted the 5 dollars I gave him.<br />
I felt especially pleased with my wonderful bargain &#x2013; until I <b>got back to the ship</b>.<br />
No matter how hard I tried,<br />
&#xa0;it was impossible to <b>fill this beautiful pen with ink</b><br />
&#xa0;and <b>to this day</b> it has never written a single word!<br />

The man to approach me was selling pens and watches.<br />
I examined a pen and found the words 'made in the USA' inscribed on the gold cap.<br />
The man wanted to sell it for $30, but I was willing to pay $5.<br />
After he reduced the price to $10, I began to walk away.<br />
A moment later, he thrust the pen into my hands for $5.<br />
I felt very pleased with my bargain until I found it couldn't write a single word.<br />
</p>

<p>
The next man who approached him was selling watches and pens,<br />
	and when the writer looked at one, it looked genuine.<br />
The man said it worth $50 but the writer could have it for $30.<br />
The writer offered him $5 and waited.<br />
Eventually, as the writer was walking away, the man agreed and took $5.<br />
The writer was very pleased &#x2013;until he was back on board.<br />
The pen was impossible to fill.<br />
It has never written a word since.<br />

The writer had only just got rid of a man who was trying to sell a diamond ring<br />
	when another man approached him with some expensive pens and watches.<br />
When he held them up for the writer to look at, the writer showed quite a lot of interest.<br />
'Can I see one of the pens?' the writer asked the man.<br />
They all looked genuine.<br />
The man handed the writer one and said: 'It's a beautiful pen, sir.<br />
	It's worth $50, but you can have it for $30.'<br />
When the writer offered him just $5, there was an argument about the price,<br />
	but eventually the man said: 'You can have it for $10, sir. That's the least I can take.'<br />
</p>

<p>
As the writer walked away shrugging his shoulders the man followed him.<br />
'I can't really do it, sir-&#x2014;I'm almost giving it away,' he said, 'but you can have it for $5.'<br />
The writer was obviously very pleased.<br />
He gave the man $5, took the pen, and the man disappeared quickly into the crowd.<br />
The writer was extremely pleased: he had bought a very expensive pen for just $5.<br />
What a bargain!<br />
Later, back on board ship,<br />
	the writer discovered why the man had been in such a hurry to get away:<br />
		you couldn't fill the pen with ink and it just didn't work!<br />
It wasn't such a 'bargain' after all!<br />
