<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0775894">
<p class="verse">
Who won the prize for the biggest biscuit?<br />
<br />
No one can <b>avoid being influenced by</b> advertisements.<br />
Much as we may <b>pride ourselves on</b> our <b>good taste</b>,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;we <b>are no longer free to</b> choose the things we want,<br />
&#xa0;for advertising <b>exerts a subtle influence on</b> us.<br />
<b>In their efforts to</b> persuade us to buy this or that product,<br />
&#xa0;advertisers have made a close study of human nature and have classified all our little weaknesses.<br />
<br />
Advertisers discovered years ago that all of us love to <b>get something for nothing</b>.<br />
An advertisement which begins with the <b>magic word</b> free can rarely go wrong.<br />
These days, advertisers not only offer free samples,<br />
&#xa0;but free cars, free houses, and free trips round the world as well.<br />
They devise hundreds of competitions which will <b>enable us to</b> win huge sums of money.<br />
Radio and television have <b>made it possible for advertisers<br />
&#xa0;to capture the attention</b> of millions of people in this way.<br />
<br />
During a radio programme,<br />
&#xa0;a company of biscuit manufacturers once asked listeners to bake biscuits<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and send them to their factory.<br />
They offered to pay 10 dollars a pound for the biggest biscuit baked by a listener.<br />
The response to this competition was tremendous.<br />
Before long, biscuits of all shapes and sizes began arriving at the factory.<br />
One lady brought in a biscuit on a wheelbarrow.<br />
It weighed nearly 500 pounds.<br />
A little later, a man <b>came along</b> with a biscuit which occupied <b>the whole boot of his car</b>.<br />
All the biscuits that were sent were carefully weighed.<br />
The largest was 713 pounds.<br />
It seemed certain that this would win the prize.<br />
But just before the competition closed,<br />
&#xa0;a lorry arrived at the factory with a truly colossal biscuit which weighed 2,400 pounds.<br />
It had been baked by a college student<br />
&#xa0;who had used over 1,000 pounds of flour,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;800 pounds of sugar, 200 pounds of fat, and 400 pounds of various other ingredients.<br />
It was so heavy that a crane had to be used to remove it from the lorry.<br />
The manufacturers had to pay more money than they had anticipated,<br />
&#xa0;for they <b>bought the biscuit from the student</b> for 24,000 dollars.<br />

<p>
A biscuit company asked its customers to bake biscuits and send them to the factory.<br />
As a prize, they offered $10 a pound for the biggest biscuit they received.<br />
The response was tremendous, with one biscuit weighing 500 pounds and another weighing 713 pounds.<br />
They though that was the winner<br />
	until a lorry delivered one which weighed 2,400 pounds baked by a college student.<br />
A crane lifted it from the lorry and the manufacturers paid the student $24,000.<br />

The other evening I listened to a quiz show on the radio<br />
	which was organised by a firm of soap manufacturers.<br />
A member of the audience was invited to answer ten questions to win money.<br />
He could take a money prize after each correct answer or go on to a more difficult question.<br />
Each new question was worth twice the last question.<br />
The man was very nervous in front of the audience, but he got the first question right.<br />
Then he slowly answered all the questions correctly<br />
	&#x2013; spelling questions, history questions,general knowledge, mathematics, &#x2026;<br />
The audience was getting very excited as the question master got to question number 9.<br />
'And your ninth question,' he said, 'is worth $1,02- Here it is.'<br />
</p>

<p>
'Which nineteenth-century sailing ship won a race from Shanghai to England?'<br />
'It was the Thermopylae,' the man said confidently. 'She beat the CuttySark.'<br />
'Correct,' said the question master, and the audience went mad.<br />
The question master had to ask them to be quiet.<br />
'And here is your tenth and last question,' the host said, 'which is worth $2,048 exactly.'<br />
'"Advertisement": how do you spell it?'<br />
The man paused and then said: 'I think this is a trick question.<br />
I can spell "advertisement", but I can also spell "it".<br />
The answer is "I-T".'<br />
'You're absolutely right,' the host said, 'and you have won $2,048! Congratulations!'<br />
