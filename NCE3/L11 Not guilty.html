What was the Customs Officer looking for?<br />
<br />
Customs Officers are quite tolerant these days,<br />
&#xa0;but they can still stop you<br />
&#xa0;when you are going through the Green Channel and have nothing to declare.<br />
Even really honest people <b>are often made to feel guilty</b>.<br />
The hardened professional smuggler,<br />
&#xa0;<b>on the other hand</b>, is never troubled by such fellings,<br />
&#xa0;even if he has five hundred gold watches hidden in his suitcase.<br />
When I returned from abroad recently,<br />
&#xa0;a particularly officious young Customers Officer clearly regarded me as a smuggler.<br />
<br />
'Have you got anything to declare?' he asked, looking me in the eye.<br />
'No', I answered confidently.<br />
'Would you mind unlocking this suitcase please?'<br />
'Not at all', I answered.<br />
<br />
The Officer went through the case with great care.<br />
All the things I had packed so carefully were soon in a dreadful mess.<br />
I felt sure I would never be able to close the case again.<br />
Suddenly, I saw the Officer's face <b>light up</b>.<br />
He had spotted a tiny bottle at the bottom of my case and he pounced on it with delight.<br />
<br />
'Perfume, eh?' he asked sarcastically.<br />
&#xa0;'You should have declared that. Perfume <b>is not exempt from</b> import duty.'<br />
'But it isn't perfume,' I said. 'It's hair gel.'<br />
Then I added with a smile, 'It's a strange mixture I make myself.'<br />
As I expected, he did not believe me.<br />
'Try it!' I said encouragingly.<br />
The Officer unscrewed the cap and put the bottle to his nostrils.<br />
He <b>was greeted by</b> an unpleasant smell which convinced him that I was telling the truth.<br />
A few minutes later, I was able to hurry away with precious chalk marks on my baggage.<br />

Though the writer had nothing to declare,<br />
	the Customs Officer made him unlock his suitcase.<br />
Searching the case very carefully,<br />
	the Officer found a small bottle, which he thought was perfume.<br />
The writer told him it was hair gel,<br />
	which he had made himself.<br />
As the Customs Officer didn't believe this,<br />
	the writer encouraged him to try it.<br />
The unpleasant smell convinced the Officer that the writer was telling the truth,<br />
	so he let him pass through the Customs.<br />

<p>
When the Customs Officer asked the traveller if he was carrying anything valuable,<br />
	the man said that he had nothing to declare.<br />
The Officer asked the man to open his suitcase.<br />
Although the case contained only a suit and some dirty clothes, it was very heavy.<br />
This made the Customs Officer suspicious, so he removed all the clothes from the case.<br />
The case was soon empty and when the Officer lifted it, he found that it was still very heavy.<br />
</p>

<p>
The Officer examined the case carefully and saw that the bottom was very shallow.<br />
He pressed the base hard<br />
	and removed the bottom part of the case<br />
		which contained a quantity of emeralds and other precious stones.<br />
While the Officer was looking at an emerald, the man tried to escape.<br />
For a moment the man disappeared among the passing holiday travellers,<br />
	but he was soon caught and placed under arrest.<br />
