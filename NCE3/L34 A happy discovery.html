<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6654db0">
<p class="verse">
What was the 'happy discovery'?<br />
<br />
<b>Antique shops exert a peculiar fascination on</b> a great many people.<br />
The more expensive kind of antique shop<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;where rare objects are beautiful displayed in glass cases to keep them free from dust<br />
&#xa0;is usually a <b>forbiding place</b>.<br />
But no one has to <b>muster up courage to enter</b> a less pretentious antique shop.<br />
<b>There is always hope</b><br />
&#xa0;that <b>in its labyrinth of</b> musty, dark, disordered rooms<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;a real rarity will be found amongst the piles of assorted junk that <b>litter the floors</b>.<br />
<br />
No one discovers a rarity <b>by chance</b>.<br />
A truly dedicated bargain hunter must have patience,<br />
&#xa0;and <b>above all</b>, the ability to recognize the worth of something when he sees it.<br />
To do this, he must be at least as knowledgeable as the dealer.<br />
Like a scientist <b>bent on making</b> a discovery,<br />
&#xa0;he must <b>cherish the hope that</b> one day he will be amply rewarded.<br />
<br />
My old friend, Frank Halliday, is just such a person.<br />
He has often <b>described to me how</b> he <b>picked up</b> a masterpiece of a mere 50 dollars.<br />
One Saturday morning, Frank visited an antique shop in my neighbourhood.<br />
As he had never been there before, he found a great deal to interest him.<br />
The morning passed rapidly<br />
&#xa0;and Frank was about to leave when he noticed a large packing case lying on the floor.<br />
The dealer told him that it had just come in,<br />
&#xa0;but that he <b>could not be bothered to open</b> it.<br />
Frank <b>begged him to do</b> so and the dealer reluctantly <b>prised it open</b>.<br />
The contents were disappointing.<br />
Apart from an interesting-looking carved dagger, the box was full of crockery, much of it broken.<br />
Frank gently lifted the crockery out of the box<br />
&#xa0;and suddenly noticed a miniature painting <b>at the bottom of</b> the packing case.<br />
As its composition and line reminded him of an Italian painting he knew well, he decided to buy it.<br />
Glancing at it briefly, the dealer told him that it was worth 50 dollars.<br />
Frank could hardly conceal his excitement,<br />
&#xa0;for he knew that he had made a real discovery.<br />
The tiny painting proved to be an unknown masterpiece by Corrggio<br />
&#xa0;and was worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.<br />

'The Antique Shop' has been in the little street near the church for years.<br />
As you look at it from across the road, it draws you towards it.<br />
It has one large window display designed to attract all sorts of customers.<br />
There is expensive glass, porcelain and jewellery to attract people with a lot of money;<br />
	there is secondhand furniture, modern silver and other things (hardly antique!)<br />
		to attract those with not so much.<br />
When you enter the shop, a little bell rings<br />
	and the owner, a little grey-haired old lady called Mrs. Century,<br />
		comes out from a room at the back<br />
		and greets you like a lost relative!<br />
She greets everyone the same and always with a smile.<br />
The shop sells all kinds of antiques.<br />
</p>

<p>
There are shelves full of old books along the back of the shop.<br />
There are two large tables in the middle of the shop covered with pieces of glass and porcelain.<br />
Then, around the walls on the floor are large pots, brass statues and things.<br />
There are lots of painting on the walls, too.<br />
At the weekend, the shop usually has five or six customers in it at one time.<br />
You might find a professional antique collector,<br />
	a holiday couple and a young mother(with child in pram) looking for a cheap antique<br />
		for her husband's birthday.<br />
We all like looking for unusual things<br />
	and hope to find a bargain one day.<br />
You might find one in Mrs. Century's 'Antique Shop'.<br />
