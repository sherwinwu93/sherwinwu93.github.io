<h2 id="org0b9ea09">Lesson 04 The double life of Alfred Bloggs</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0b9ea09">
<p class="verse">
Why did Alf want a white-collar job?<br />
<br />
<b>These days</b>,<br />
&#xa0;people who <b>do manual work</b> often receive <b>far more</b> money than people who work in offices.<br />
People who work in offices<br />
&#xa0;<b>are frequently referred to as</b> '<b>white-collar workers</b>' <b>for the simple reason</b><br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that they usually wear a collar and tie to go to work.<br />
<b>Such is human nature,</b><br />
&#xa0;that a great many people <b>are often willing to sacrifice higher pay</b><br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;for the privilege of becoming white-collar workers.<br />
This can <b>give rise to</b> curious situations,<br />
&#xa0;as it did in the case of Alfred Bloggs who worked as a dustman for the Ellesmere Corporation.<br />
<br />
When he got married, Alf <b>was too embarrassed to</b> say anything to his wife about his job.<br />
He simply told her that he worked for the Corporation.<br />
Every morning, he left home <b>dressed in</b> a smart black suit.<br />
He then <b>changed into</b> overalls and spent the next eight hours as a dustman.<br />
Before returning home at night, he <b>took a shower</b> and changed back into his suit.<br />
Alf did this for over two years and his fellow dustmen kept his secret.<br />
Alf's wife has never discovered that she married a dustman and she never will,<br />
&#xa0;for Alf has just found another job.<br />
He will soon be working in an office.<br />
He will be earning only <b>half as much as</b> he used to,<br />
&#xa0;but he feels that his rise in status is well worth the loss of money.<br />
<b>From now on</b>, he will wear a suit all day and others will <b>call him Mr. Bloggs</b>, not Alf.<br />

When they got married, Alfred Bloggs simply told his wife that he worked for the Corporation.<br />
Though he was dressed in a smart black suit before he left home,<br />
	he changed into overalls and spent the day as a dustman.<br />
The he took a shower and changed back into the suit at night.<br />
This lasted for over two years and his fellow dustmen kept his secret.<br />
His wife will never learn the truth, for her husband will be working in an office in future.<br />

One morning Alf and three other dustmen were collecting rubbish in Merton Street<br />
	and they stopped outside Mrs. Frost's house.<br />
Though Alf didn't know it, his wife was visiting Mrs. Frost at the time.<br />
She and Mrs. Frost were old friends, though Mrs. Frost had never met Alf.<br />
Alf was just getting out of the dust cart to go into Mrs. Frost's backyard<br />
	when he saw his wife leaving Mrs. Frost's house.<br />
He quickly returned to the dust cart and hid in the driving cabin.<br />
While he was hiding, his fellow dustmen helped him by collecting Mrs. Frost's rubbish.<br />
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Alf's wife and Mrs. Frost talked on the doorstep.<br />
It looked as though their conversation would never end!<br />
At last Mrs. Bloggs said goodbye to Mrs. Frost.<br />
She waved to one of the dustmen whom she recognized<br />
	and she went towards the dustcart to greet him.<br />
The dustman waved back and gave her a big smile as the dustcart drove off.<br />
Mrs. Bloggs stood on the pavement and watched the dustcart disappear down the street.<br />
Then she began to walk home.<br />
'It's all right, Alf', his friend said.<br />
'She can't see you now.'<br />
'Thanks, Jim,' Alf said. 'That was a luck escape!'<br />
