* Lesson 24 A skeleton in the cupboard
#+begin_verse
Who was Sebastian?

We often read in novels
	how a seemingly respectable person or family has some terrible secret
		which has *been concealed from* strangers for years.
The English language possesses a vivid saying to describe this sort of situation.
The terrible secret is called 'a skeleton in the cupboard'.
At some dramatic moment in the story, the terrible secret becomes known and a reputation is ruined.
The reader's *hair stands on end*
	when he reads in the final pages of the novel
		that the heroine, a dear old lady who had always been so kind to everybody,
			had, *in her youth*, poisoned every one of her five husbands.

*It is all very well* for such things to occur in fiction.
*To varying degrees*, we all have secrets
		which we do not want even our closest friends to learn,
	but few of us have skeletons in the cupboard.
The only person I know who has a skeleton in the cupboard is George Carlton,
	and he is very pround of the fact.
George studied medicine in his youth.
Instead of becoming a doctor, however, he became a successful writer of detective stories.
I once spent an uncomfortable weekend which I shall never forget at his house.
George *showed me to* the guestroom which, he said, was rarely used.
He told me to unpack my things and then come down to dinner.
After I had stacked my shirts and underclothes *in two empty drawers*,
	I decided to hang one of the two suits I had *brought with me* in the cupboard.
I opened the cupboard door and then stood in front of it petrified.
A skeleton was dangling before my eyes.
The sudden movement of the door made it sway slightly
	and *it gave me the impression that* it *was about to leap out at* me.
Dropping my suit, I dashed downstairs to tell George.
This was worse than 'a terrible secret'; this was a real skeleton!
But George was unsympathetic,
	'Oh, that,'	he said with a smile as if he were talking about an old friend.
'That's Sebastian. You forget that I was a *medical student once upon a time*.'

I was showed to the guest room which was rarely used.
After having stacked my shirts and underclothes in the drawers,
	I opened the cupboard door to hang my suit in the cupboard.
A skeleton was dangling before my eyes
	and it gave me the impression that it was about to leap out at me.
Dropping my suit, I rushed downstairs to tell George.
But George was unsympathetic and told me:
	'That's Sebastian. You forget that I was a medical student once upon a time'.

The writer started to unpack and put his shirts and underclothes into drawers
	and then decided to hang a suit in the cupboard.
He opened the cupboard and stood petrified: there, dangling in front of him, was a skeleton.
It was swaying and ready to leap out at him.
He dropped his suit and dashed downstairs to tell George.
Georage was unsympathetic and told the writer
	it was Sebastian, a skeleton he had when he was a medical student.

Now that George had explained about the skeleton, I felt better,
	but I still didn't want to sleep in the room with a skeleton hanging in the cupboard.
I asked George to remove him, but he refused.
'There's nowhere else to put him,' said George, 'so he'll have to stay.'
I couldn't disagree of course,
	but the moment I lay down to sleep, I knew it was going to be an uncomfortable night.
In the end, I decided that I would take Sebastian somewhere for the night
	and bring him back up to my room early in the morning.
So I took him out of cupboard and walked around the house with him
	trying to find somewhere to put him.

George's maid was just going to bed as I walked along the landing.
She saw Sebastian apparently walking around, screamed and fainted.
She had obviously woken Carlton who appeared from his bedroom and,
	when the girl had regained consciousness, explained everything to her.
He accused me of being stupid and sent me and Sebastian back to our's room
	where I hung him up in the cupboard again.
Imagine my surprise when I picked up one of Carlton's detective stories two years later.
There I was, with Sebastianthe skeleton,
	as the main characters in one of his stories for the whole world to read.
Still, he didn't use my real name,so I should be glad of that!
