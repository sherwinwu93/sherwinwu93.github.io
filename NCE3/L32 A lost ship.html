<h2 id="orgc86bd2b">Lesson 32 A lost ship</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc86bd2b">
<p class="verse">
Did the crew of the Elkor find what they were looking for? Why?<br />
<br />
The <b>salvage operation</b> had been a complete failure.<br />
The small ship, Elkor, which had been searching the Barents Sea for weeks,<br />
&#xa0;was on its way home.<br />
A radio message from the mainland had been received by the ship's captain<br />
&#xa0;instructing him to give up the search.<br />
The captain knew that another attempt would be made later,<br />
&#xa0;for the sunken ship he was trying to find had been carrying <b>a precious cargo of</b> gold bullion.<br />
<br />
Despite the message, the captain of the Elkor decided to try once more.<br />
The sea bed was scoured with powerful nets<br />
&#xa0;and there was tremendous excitement on board when a chest was raised from the bottom.<br />
Though the crew <b>were at first under the impression that</b> the lost ship had been found,<br />
&#xa0;the contents of the chest proved them wrong.<br />
What they had in fact found was a ship which had been sunk many years before.<br />
<br />
The chest contained the personal belongings of a seaman, Alan Fielding.<br />
There were books, clothing and photographs,<br />
&#xa0;<b>together with</b> letters which the seaman had once received from his wife.<br />
The captain of the Elkor ordered his men to salvage as much as possible from the wreck.<br />
Nothing of value was found,<br />
&#xa0;but the numerous items which were brought to the surface proved to be of great interest.<br />
From a heavy gun that was raised,<br />
&#xa0;the captain realized that the ship must have been a cruiser.<br />
In another chest, which contained the belongings of a ship's officer,<br />
&#xa0;there was an unfinished letter which had been written on March 14th, 1943.<br />
The captain leant from the letter that the name of the lost ship was the Karen.<br />
The most valuable find of all was the ship's log book,<br />
&#xa0;parts of which it was still possible to read.<br />
From this the captain was able to <b>piece together</b> all the information that had <b>come to light</b>.<br />
The Karen had been sailing <b>in a convoy</b> to Russia when she was torpedoed by an enemy submarine.<br />
This was later confirmed by <b>a naval official</b> at the Ministry of Defence<br />
&#xa0;after the Elkor had returned home.<br />
All the items that were found were sent to the War Museum.<br />

A chest, which contained books, clothing, photographs and letters,<br />
	was raised from the bottom of the sea.<br />
Because this proved that it belonged to a seaman,<br />
	the captain of the Elkor instructed his men to salvage as much as possible.<br />
From a heavy gun that was raised, the captain knew the ship must have been a cruiser.<br />
The captain learnt from the letter in another chest that the name of the lost ship was the Karen.<br />
From the ship's log book, parts of which it was still able to read,<br />
	the captain piece together all the information.<br />
The Karen was torpedoed by an enemy submarine in a convoy to Russia.<br />
All the items that were salvaged were sent to the War Museum.<br />
</p>

<p>
The chest containing the personal belongings of Alan Fielding told them a lot,<br />
	and there were other items of interest.<br />
A heavy gun proved the ship was a cruiser.<br />
Another chest belonging to a ship's officer<br />
	contained an unfinished letter dated March 14th, 1943,<br />
		from which they learnt the ship's name.<br />
The most valuable find was the ship's log book,<br />
	which told them the Karen had been sailing in convoy to Russia<br />
	when she was torpedoed by an enemy submarine.<br />

The journey has gone well so far.<br />
We are now on the way to Russia and hope that we arrive with no more problems.<br />
But we are watching the sea and sky.<br />
The convoy successfully fought off an air attack early this morning.<br />
No ships were lost and we managed to shoot down three enemy aircraft<br />
	before they broke off the attack.<br />
</p>

<p>
At 10 a.m. this morning we were attacked by a U-boat.<br />
This was the first time we had been attacked<br />
	and for most men on board this was the first time they had been in action at sea.<br />
We were fortunate, but the ship ahead of us, the Dauntless, was torpedoed and sunk.<br />
</p>

<p>
After the ship sank, there were hundreds of men in the sea.<br />
We picked up as many survivors as we could in the Karen.<br />
In fact in the end we picked up 720 men.<br />
Which meant that 50 men lost their lives in the attack on the Dauntless.<br />
The Karen was packed with men, many crowded on the open decks,<br />
	when we turned and attacked the U-boat.<br />
Depth charges were dropped and the U-boat was put out of action.<br />
</p>

<p>
It is now 3.15 p.m., the light is already beginning to fade and storm clouds are gathering.<br />
We are about to be attacked by a second U-boat, this time from the north.<br />
The captain has just announced.<br />
