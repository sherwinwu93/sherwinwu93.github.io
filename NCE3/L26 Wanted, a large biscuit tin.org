* Lesson 26 Wanted: a large biscuit tin
#+begin_verse
Who won the prize for the biggest biscuit?

No one can *avoid being influenced by* advertisements.
Much as we may *pride ourselves on* our *good taste*,
		we *are no longer free to* choose the things we want,
	for advertising *exerts a subtle influence on* us.
*In their efforts to* persuade us to buy this or that product,
	advertisers have made a close study of human nature and have classified all our little weaknesses.

Advertisers discovered years ago that all of us love to *get something for nothing*.
An advertisement which begins with the *magic word* free can rarely go wrong.
These days, advertisers not only offer free samples,
	but free cars, free houses, and free trips round the world as well.
They devise hundreds of competitions which will *enable us to* win huge sums of money.
Radio and television have *made it possible for advertisers
	to capture the attention* of millions of people in this way.

During a radio programme,
	a company of biscuit manufacturers once asked listeners to bake biscuits
		and send them to their factory.
They offered to pay 10 dollars a pound for the biggest biscuit baked by a listener.
The response to this competition was tremendous.
Before long, biscuits of all shapes and sizes began arriving at the factory.
One lady brought in a biscuit on a wheelbarrow.
It weighed nearly 500 pounds.
A little later, a man *came along* with a biscuit which occupied *the whole boot of his car*.
All the biscuits that were sent were carefully weighed.
The largest was 713 pounds.
It seemed certain that this would win the prize.
But just before the competition closed,
	a lorry arrived at the factory with a truly colossal biscuit which weighed 2,400 pounds.
It had been baked by a college student
	who had used over 1,000 pounds of flour,
		800 pounds of sugar, 200 pounds of fat, and 400 pounds of various other ingredients.
It was so heavy that a crane had to be used to remove it from the lorry.
The manufacturers had to pay more money than they had anticipated,
	for they *bought the biscuit from the student* for 24,000 dollars.

The other evening I listened to a quiz show on the radio
	which was organised by a firm of soap manufacturers.
A member of the audience was invited to answer ten questions to win money.
He could take a money prize after each correct answer or go on to a more difficult question.
Each new question was worth twice the last question.
The man was very nervous in front of the audience, but he got the first question right.
Then he slowly answered all the questions correctly
	-- spelling questions, history questions,general knowledge, mathematics, ...
The audience was getting very excited as the question master got to question number 9.
'And your ninth question,' he said, 'is worth $1,02- Here it is.'

'Which nineteenth-century sailing ship won a race from Shanghai to England?'
'It was the Thermopylae,' the man said confidently. 'She beat the CuttySark.'
'Correct,' said the question master, and the audience went mad.
The question master had to ask them to be quiet.
'And here is your tenth and last question,' the host said, 'which is worth $2,048 exactly.'
'"Advertisement": how do you spell it?'
The man paused and then said: 'I think this is a trick question.
I can spell "advertisement", but I can also spell "it".
The answer is "I-T".'
'You're absolutely right,' the host said, 'and you have won $2,048! Congratulations!'
