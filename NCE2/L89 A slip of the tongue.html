<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orged198d3">
<p class="verse">
Who made the only funny joke that evening and why?<br />
<br />
People will <b>do anything to see</b> a free show -&#x2014; even if it is a bad one.<br />
When <b>the news got round</b><br />
&#xa0;that <b>a comedy show</b> would be presented at our local cinema by the P. and U. Bird Seed Company,<br />
&#xa0;we all rushed to see it.<br />
We had to queue for hours to get in and there must have been several hundred people present<br />
&#xa0;just before the show began.<br />
Unfortunately, the show was one of the dullest we have ever seen.<br />
Those who failed to get in need not have <b>felt disappointed</b>,<br />
&#xa0;as many of the artistes who should have appeared did not come.<br />
The only funny things we heard that evening<br />
&#xa0;came from the advertiser <b>at the beginning of the programme</b>.<br />
He was obviously very nervous and for some minutes stood awkwardly before the microphone.<br />
As soon as he opened his mouth, everyone <b>burst out laughing</b>.<br />
We all know what the poor man should have said,<br />
&#xa0;but what he actually said was: 'This is the Poo and Ee Seed Bird Company.<br />
Good ladies, evening and gentlemen!’<br />
