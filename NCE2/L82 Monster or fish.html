<h2 id="org2b5005e">Lesson 82 Monster or fish?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2b5005e">
<p class="verse">
What was the monster called?<br />
<br />
Fishermen and sailors sometimes <b>claim to have seen</b> monsters in the sea.<br />
Though people have often <b>laughed at</b> stories told by seamen,<br />
&#xa0;<b>it is now known that</b><br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;many of these 'monsters' which have <b>at times</b> been sighted are simply strange fish.<br />
Occasionally, unusual creatures are washed to the shore,<br />
&#xa0;but they are rarely caught <b>out at sea</b>.<br />
Some time ago, however, a peculiar fish was caught near Madagascar.<br />
A small fishing boat was carried miles out to sea by the powerful fish as it pulled on the line.<br />
Realizing that this was no ordinary fish,<br />
&#xa0;the fisherman made every effort not to damage it <b>in any way</b>.<br />
When it was eventually brought to shore,<br />
&#xa0;<b>it was found to be</b> over thirteen feet long.<br />
It had a head like a horse,<br />
&#xa0;big blue eyes, shining silver skin, and a bright red tail.<br />
The fish, which has since been sent to a museum<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;where it is being examined by a scientist,<br />
&#xa0;is called an oarfish.<br />
Such creatures have rarely been seen alive by man as they live at <b>a depth of</b> six hundred feet.<br />
