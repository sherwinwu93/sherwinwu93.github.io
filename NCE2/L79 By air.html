<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7f4ca5b">
<p class="verse">
Why did the plane turn back?<br />
<br />
I used to travel by air <b>a great deal</b> when I was a boy.<br />
My parents used to live in South America and I used to fly there from Europe in the holidays.<br />
A flight attendant would <b>take charge of</b> me and I never had an unpleasant experience.<br />
I <b>am used to travelling</b> by air and only on one occasion have I ever <b>felt frightened</b>.<br />
After <b>taking off</b>, we were flying low over the city and slowly <b>gaining height</b>,<br />
&#xa0;when the plane suddenly turned round and flew back to the airport.<br />
While we were waiting to land,<br />
&#xa0;a flight attendant told us to keep calm and to get off the plane quietly<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;as soon as it had <b>touched down</b>.<br />
Everybody <b>on board</b> was worried<br />
&#xa0;and we <b>were curious to find out</b> what had happened.<br />
Later we learnt that there was a very important person on board.<br />
The police had been told that <b>a bomb had been planted</b> on the plane.<br />
After we had landed, the plane was searched thoroughly.<br />
Fortunately, nothing was found and five hours later we were able to take off again.<br />
