* Lesson 24 It could be worse

#+begin_verse
Had the writer's money been stolen?

I entered the hotel manager's office and sat down.
I had just lost $50 and I felt very upset.
'I left the money in my room,' I said, 'and it's not there now.'
The manager was sympathetic,
	but he could do nothing.
'Everyone's losing money these days,' he said.
He *started to* *complain about this wicked world*
	but was interrupted by a knock at the door.
A girl came in and put an envelope on his desk.
It contained $50.
'I found this outside this gentleman's room,' she said.
'Well,' I said to the manager, 'there is still some honesty in this world!'
