Did the boy go where he wanted to?<br />
<br />
Children who <b>play truant from school</b> are unimaginative.<br />
A quiet day's fishing, or eight hours in a cinema seeing the same film <b>over and over again</b>,<br />
&#xa0;is usually as far as they get.<br />
They have all <b>been put to shame</b> by a boy who, while playing truant, travelled 1,600 miles.<br />
He <b>hitchhiked to Dover</b> and, towards evening, went into a boat to find somewhere to sleep.<br />
When he woke up next morning,<br />
&#xa0;he discovered that the boat had, <b>in the meantime</b>, travelled to Calais.<br />
No one noticed the boy as he crept off.<br />
From there, he hitchhiked to Paris in a lorry.<br />
The driver gave him a few biscuits and a cup of coffee and left him just outside the city.<br />
The next car the boy stopped did not take him into the centre of Paris as he hoped it would,<br />
&#xa0;but to Perpignan on the French-Spanish border.<br />
There he was picked up by a policeman and sent back to England by the local authorities.<br />
He has surely set up a record for the thousands of children who dream of evading school.<br />
