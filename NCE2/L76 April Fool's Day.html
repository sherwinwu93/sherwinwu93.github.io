<p class="verse">
What was the joke?<br />
<br />
'To end our special news bulletin,' said the voice of the television announcer,<br />
&#xa0;'we're going over to the macaroni fields of Calabria.<br />
Macaroni has been grown in this area for over six hundred years.<br />
Two of the leading growers, Giuseppe Moldova and Riccardo Brabante, tell me<br />
&#xa0;that they have been expecting a splendid crop this year<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and harvesting has begun earlier than usual.<br />
Here you can see two workers who,<br />
&#xa0;between them, have just finished cutting three cartloads of golden brown macaroni stalks.<br />
The whole village has been working day and night<br />
&#xa0;gathering and threshing this year's crop before the September rains.<br />
On the right, you can see Mrs. Brabante herself.<br />
She has been helping her husband for thirty years now.<br />
Mrs .Brabante is talking to the manager of the local factory where the crop is processed.<br />
This last scene shows you what will happen <b>at the end of the harvest</b>:<br />
&#xa0;the famous Calabrian macaroni-eating competition!<br />
Signor Fratelli, the present champion, has won it every year since 1991.<br />
And that ends our special bulletin for today, Thursday, April 1st.<br />
We're now going back to the studio.'<br />
