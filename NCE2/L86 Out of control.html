What was the danger?<br />
<br />
As the man tried to swing the speedboat round, the steering wheel <b>came away</b> in his hands.<br />
He waved desperately to his companion, who had been water skiing for the last fifteen minutes.<br />
Both men had hardly had time to realize what was happening<br />
&#xa0;when they were thrown violently into the sea.<br />
The speedboat had struck a buoy,<br />
&#xa0;but it continued to move very quickly across the water.<br />
Both men had just begun to swim towards the shore,<br />
&#xa0;when <b>they noticed with dismay</b> that the speedboat was moving <b>in a circle</b>.<br />
It now came straight towards them <b>at tremendous speed</b>.<br />
In less than a minute, it roared past them only a few feet away.<br />
After it had passed,<br />
&#xa0;they swam on as quickly as they could because they knew that the boat would soon return.<br />
They had just had enough time to swim out of danger<br />
&#xa0;when the boat again completed a circle.<br />
On this occasion, however, it had slowed down considerably.<br />
The petrol had nearly all <b>been used up</b>.<br />
<b>Before long</b>, the noise dropped completely and the boat began to drift gently across the water.<br />

The moment the speedboat struck the buoy, both men were thrown into the water.<br />
As it was moving off very quickly across the water,<br />
	both men begun to swim towards the shore.<br />
Turning in a circle, the speedboat came straight towards them.<br />
After it had just missed them, both men swam util they were on out of danger.<br />
When the boat returned it had lost speed.<br />
Soon all the petrol was used up and it floated across the water.<br />

Because the speedboat struck the buoy, both men were thrown into the water.<br />
It was moving off very quickly<br />
	and, while the men were swimming towards the shore,<br />
		it turned in a circle, came straight towards them and only just missed them.<br />
The men had no sooner swum out of danger than the boat returned.<br />
This time, however, it lost speed because all the petrol was used up<br />
	and it floated across the water.<br />
