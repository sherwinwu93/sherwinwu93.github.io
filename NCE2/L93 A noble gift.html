Where was the Statue of Liberty made?<br />
<br />
One of the most famous monuments in the world, the Statue of Liberty,<br />
&#xa0;was presented to the United States of America in the nineteenth century by the people of France.<br />
The great statue, which was designed by the sculptor Auguste Bartholdi, took ten years to complete.<br />
The actual figure was made of copper<br />
&#xa0;supported by a metal framework which had been especially constructed by Eiffel.<br />
Before it could be transported to the United States,<br />
&#xa0;a site had to be found for it and a pedestal had to be built.<br />
The site chosen was an island <b>at the entrance of</b> New York Harbour.<br />
By 1884, a statue which was 151 feet tall had been erected in Paris.<br />
The following year, it was <b>taken to pieces</b> and sent to America.<br />
By the end of October 1886, the statue had been put together again<br />
&#xa0;and it was officially presented to the American people by Bartholdi.<br />
Ever since then, the great monument has been a symbol of liberty for the millions of people<br />
&#xa0;who have passed through New York Harbour to make their homes in America.<br />

The statue of Liberty was presented to U.S.A. by French people in the 19th century.<br />
Though designed by Bartholdi, it was built on a mental frame constructed by Eiffel.<br />
The site chosen for it was an island at the entrance of New York Harbour<br />
	and the Pedsetal had to be built there.<br />
The statue was first erected in Paris in 1884,<br />
	but it was re-erected two years later in America<br />
	and officially presented in October, 1886.<br />
