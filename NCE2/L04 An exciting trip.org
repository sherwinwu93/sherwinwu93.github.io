Why is Tim finding this trip exciting?

He is in Australia.
He has been there for six months.
Tim is an engineer.
He is working for a big firm and he has already visited *a great number of* different places in Australia.
He has just bought an Australian car and *has gone to Alice Springs*, a small town in the centre of Australia.
He will soon visit Darwin.
From there, he will *fly to Perth*.
