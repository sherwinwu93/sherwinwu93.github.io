Why was their disguise ‘too perfect’?<br />
<br />
An ancient bus stopped by a dry river bed and <b>a party of</b> famous actors and actresses got off.<br />
Dressed in dark glasses and old clothes,<br />
&#xa0;they had <b>taken special precautions</b> so that no one should recognize them.<br />
But as they soon discovered, disguises can sometimes be too perfect.<br />
'This is a wonderful place for a picnic,' said Gloria Gleam.<br />
'It couldn't be better, Gloria,' Brinksley Meers agreed.<br />
'No newspaper men, no film fans!<br />
<b>Why don't we</b> come more often?'<br />
Meanwhile, two other actors, Rockwall Slinger and Merlin Greeves,<br />
&#xa0;had <b>carried two large food baskets to</b> a shady spot under some trees.<br />
When they had all <b>made themselves comfortable</b>, a stranger appeared.<br />
He looked very angry.<br />
'Now you get out of here, all of you!' he shouted.<br />
'I'm sheriff here.<br />
Do you see that notice? It says "No Camping" &#x2013; in case you can't read!'<br />
'Look, sheriff,' said Rockwall, '<b>don't be too hard on us</b>.<br />
I'm Rockwall Slinger and this is Merlin Greeves.'<br />
'Oh, is it?' said the sheriff with a sneer.<br />
'Well, I'm Brinksley Meers, and my other name is Gloria Gleam.<br />
Now you <b>get out of here</b> fast!'<br />

After an ancient bus had stopped by a river bed, a party of famous film stars descended.<br />
They were dressed in dark glasses and old clothes so as not to be recognized.<br />
Two of the actors carried some picnic things to a shady spot and everyone sat down.<br />
Just then a sheriff told them rudely that they must leave because camping was not allowed.<br />
Even when they told him who they were, he did not believe them.<br />
