What was wrong with the man's story?<br />
<br />
'At the time the murder was committed,<br />
&#xa0;I was travelling on the 8 o'clock train to London,' said the man.<br />
'Do you always catch such an early train?' asked the inspector.<br />
'Of course I do,' answered the man.<br />
'I must be at work at 10 o'clock.<br />
My employer will confirm that I was there on time.'<br />
'Would a later train get you to work on time?' asked the inspector.<br />
'I suppose it would, but I never catch a later train.'<br />
'At what time did you arrive at the station?'<br />
'At ten to eight.<br />
I bought a paper and waited for the train.'<br />
'And you didn't notice anything unusual?'<br />
'Of course not.'<br />
'I suggest,' said the inspector, 'that you are not telling the truth.<br />
I suggest that you did not catch the 8 o'clock train,<br />
&#xa0;but that you caught the 8.25 which would still get you to work on time.<br />
You see, on the morning of the murder, the 8 o'clock train did not run at all.<br />
It broke down at Ferngreen station and was taken off the line.'<br />
