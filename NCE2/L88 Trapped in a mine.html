<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7a091b7">
<p class="verse">
Why is the rescue taking so long?<br />
<br />
Six men have been trapped in a mine for seventeen hours.<br />
If they are not brought to the surface soon they may <b>lose their lives</b>.<br />
However, rescue operations are proving difficult.<br />
If explosives are used, vibrations will <b>cause the roof of the mine to collapse</b>.<br />
Rescue workers are therefore drilling a hole on the north side of the mine.<br />
They intend to bring the men up <b>in a special capsule</b>.<br />
If there had not been <b>a hard layer of</b> rock beneath the soil,<br />
&#xa0;they would have completed the job in a few hours.<br />
<b>As it is</b>, they have been drilling for sixteen hours and they still have a long way to go.<br />
Meanwhile, a microphone, which was lowered into the mine two hours ago,<br />
&#xa0;has <b>enabled the men to keep in touch with</b> their closest relatives.<br />
Though they are <b>running out of</b> food and drink,<br />
&#xa0;the men are cheerful and confident that they will get out soon.<br />
They have been told that rescue operations are progressing smoothly.<br />
If they knew how difficult it was to drill through the hard rock, they would <b>lose heart</b>.<br />

Six men have been trapped in a mine for seventeen hours<br />
	and may lose their lives.<br />
Rescue operations are proving difficult<br />
	as explosives might cause the roof of the mine to collapse.<br />
Because of this, rescue workers are drilling a hole through hard rock,<br />
	 yet progress is slow.<br />
Now that a microphone has been lowered into the mine,<br />
	the men are in touch with their closest relatives.<br />
Though they are running short of food and drink,<br />
	they are in good spirits.<br />
