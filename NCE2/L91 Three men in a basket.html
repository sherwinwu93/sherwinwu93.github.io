Where was the station's Commanding Officer?<br />
<br />
A pilot noticed a balloon which <b>seemed to be making for</b> a Royal Air Force Station nearby.<br />
He informed the station at once, but no one there was able to explain the mystery.<br />
The officer in the control tower was very angry when he heard the news,<br />
&#xa0;because balloons can be a great danger to aircraft.<br />
He said that someone might be <b>spying on</b> the station<br />
&#xa0;and the pilot was ordered to <b>keep track of</b> the strange object.<br />
The pilot managed to circle the balloon for some time.<br />
He could <b>make out</b> three men in a basket under it and one of them was holding a pair of binoculars.<br />
When the balloon was over the station, the pilot saw one of the men taking photographs.<br />
<b>Soon afterwards</b>, the balloon began to descend and it landed near an airfield.<br />
The police <b>were called in</b>, but they could not arrest anyone,<br />
&#xa0;for the basket contained two Members of Parliament and the Commanding Officer of the station!<br />
As the Commanding Officer explained later,<br />
&#xa0;one half of the station did not know what the other half was doing!<br />
