What kind of fish are they?<br />
<br />
Fish and chips has always been a favourite dish in Britain,<br />
&#xa0;but as the oceans have been overfished, fish has become more and more expensive.<br />
So it comes as a surprise to learn that giant fish are terrifying the divers on North Sea oil rigs.<br />
Oil rigs have to be repaired frequently<br />
&#xa0;and divers, who often have to work in darkness a hundred feet under water,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;have <b>been frightened out of their wits</b> by giant fish bumping into them as they work.<br />
Now they have had special cages made to <b>protect them from</b> these monsters.<br />
The fish are not sharks or killer whales,<br />
&#xa0;but favourite eating varieties like cod and skate<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;which grow to unnatural sizes, sometimes as much as twelve feet <b>in length</b>.<br />
Three factors have caused these fish to grow so large:<br />
&#xa0;the warm water round the hot oil pipes under the sea;<br />
&#xa0;the plentiful supply of food thrown overboard by the crews on the rigs;<br />
&#xa0;<b>the total absence of</b> fishing boats around the oil rigs.<br />
<b>As a result</b>, the fish just eat and eat and grow and grow in the lovely warm water.<br />
Who eats who?<br />

Divers working on the North Sea oil rigs<br />
	are often terrified by giant fish<br />
		that bump into them when they are working in deep water.<br />
These fish are not sharks or whales.<br />
On the contrary, they are favourite eating varieties<br />
	that grow to unnatural sizes.<br />
Three factors caused them to grow so large:<br />
	the first is the warmth from oil-pipes;<br />
	the second is the supply of plentiful food;<br />
  the third is the absence of fishing boat round the rigs.<br />
