* Lesson 27 A wet night

#+begin_verse
What happened to the boys in the night?

Late in the afternoon, the boys *put up their tent* in the middle of a field.
As soon as this was done,
	they cooked a meal over an open fire.
They were all hungry
	and the food smelled good.
After a wonderful meal, they *told stories* and sang songs by the campfire.
But some time later it began to rain.
The boys felt tired
	so they *put out the fire* and crept into their tent.
Their sleeping bags were warm and comfortable,
	so they all slept soundly.
In the middle of the night, two boys *woke up* and began shouting.
The tent was full of water!
They all leapt out of their sleeping bags and hurried outside.
It was raining heavily
	and they found that a stream had formed in the field.
The stream wound its way across the field
	and then flowed right under their tent.
