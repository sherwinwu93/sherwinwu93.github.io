When did you last go to the theatre/cinema? Tell me about the play/film.<br />
I last went to the cinema about two months ago when I was wanderring in the mall.<br />
Suddenly it occurred to me that it's been a long time I haven't watched a movie with my wife.<br />
It happened that there was a movie directed by Gong Qijun,<br />
 who made several famous animated movies.<br />
Of course, this was his another animated movie.<br />
A boy who has lost his mother when he was very young moved to a new place<br />
 where he met his mother-in-law.<br />
It seemed that he didn't like his new mother.<br />
After he quarrelled with his new classmates and injured himself,<br />
 he found a secret which was between his mother and his mother-in-law.<br />
In the end, he got along well with his mother-in-law.<br />

Of course, this was another animated movie of his.<br />
The movie <b>revolved around</b> a boy<br />
 who had lost his mother at a very young age<br />
   and moved to a new place where he met his mother-in-law.<br />
It seemed that he didn't like his new mother.<br />
After quarreling with his new classmates and injuring himself,<br />
 he <b>discovered a secret</b> that involved his mother and his mother-in-law.<br />
In the end, he managed to get along well with his mother-in-law.<br />

Do you get angry easily? What sort of thing makes you angry?<br />
Yes, I get angry easily.<br />
I got angry in the case in which I couldn't get it under control.<br />
Like my wife complains about some household chores and I sleep in and so on.<br />

<p>
Yes, I do get angry easily.<br />
I find it difficult to control my anger in certain situations.<br />
For example, when my wife complains about household chores or when I oversleep,<br />
 it tends to provoke my anger.<br />

Would you like to be an actor? Why/Why not?<br />
I wouldn't like to be an actor.<br />
Because I'm too shy to disappear in TV.<br />
And I don't like to get along with so many people.<br />
Sometimes I'll fear that it will spoil my private life a lot if I rise to fame.<br />

I wouldn't like to be an actor.<br />
I'm too shy to be comfortable appearing on TV,<br />
 and I prefer not to <b>interact with</b> large groups of people.<br />
Additionally, I fear that fame would <b>intrude too much on</b> my private life<br />
 if I were to become well-known.<br />
