<h2 id="org1386670">Lesson 77 A successful operation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1386670">
<p class="verse">
Did the doctors find out how the woman died?<br />
<br />
The mummy of an Egyptian woman who died in 800 B.C. has just had an operation.<br />
The mummy is that of Shepenmut who was once a singer in the Temple of Thebes.<br />
As there were strange marks on the X-ray plates taken of the mummy,<br />
&#xa0;doctors have been trying to find out whether the woman died of a rare disease.<br />
The only way to do this was to operate.<br />
The operation, which lasted for over four hours,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;proved to be very difficult because of the hard resin which covered the skin.<br />
The doctors removed a section of the mummy and sent it to a laboratory.<br />
They also found something which the X-ray plates did not show:<br />
&#xa0;a small wax figure of the god Duamutef.<br />
This god which has the head of a cow was normally placed inside a mummy.<br />
The doctors have not yet decided how the woman died.<br />
They feared that the mummy would fall to pieces when they cut it open,<br />
&#xa0;but fortunately this has not happened.<br />
The mummy successfully survived the operation.<br />
