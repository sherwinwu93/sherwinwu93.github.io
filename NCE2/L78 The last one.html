<p class="verse">
For how long did the writer give up smoking?<br />
<br />
After reading an article entitled 'Cigarette Smoking and Your Health'<br />
&#xa0;I lit a cigarette to <b>calm my nerves</b>.<br />
I smoked with concentration and pleasure as I <b>was sure that</b> this would be my last cigarette.<br />
For a whole week I did not smoke at all and during this time, my wife suffered terribly.<br />
I had all the usual symptoms of someone giving up smoking: a bad temper and an enormous appetite.<br />
My friends <b>kept on offering me cigarettes and cigars</b>.<br />
They <b>made no effort to hide</b> their amusement<br />
&#xa0;whenever I produced <b>a packet of</b> sweets from my pocket.<br />
After seven days of this I went to a party.<br />
Everybody around me was smoking and I felt extremely uncomfortable.<br />
When my old friend Brian <b>urged me to accept</b> a cigarette, it was more than I could bear.<br />
I took one guiltily, lit it and smoked with satisfaction.<br />
My wife <b>was delighted that</b> things had <b>returned to normal</b> once more.<br />
Anyway, as Brian pointed out, it is the easiest thing in the world to give up smoking.<br />
He himself has done it lots of times!<br />
