<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org15d6ae9">
<p class="verse">
Why did Patrick keep on asking the same question?<br />
<br />
The former Prime Minister, Mr. Wentworth Lane, was defeated in the recent elections.<br />
He is now retiring from political life and has gone abroad.<br />
My friend, Patrick, has always been a fanatical opponent of Mr. Lane's Radical Progressive Party.<br />
After the elections, Patrick went to the former Prime Minister's house.<br />
When he asked if Mr. Lane lived there,<br />
&#xa0;the policeman <b>on duty</b> told him that since his defeat, the ex-Prime Minister had gone abroad.<br />
<b>On the following day</b>, Patrick went to the house again.<br />
The same policeman was just walking slowly past the entrance,<br />
&#xa0;when Patrick asked the same question.<br />
Though a little suspicious this time, the policeman gave him the same answer.<br />
The day after, Patrick went to the house once more and asked exactly the same question.<br />
This time, the policeman lost his temper.<br />
'I told you yesterday and the day before yesterday,' he shouted,<br />
'Mr. Lane was defeated in the elections.<br />
He has retired from political life and gone to live abroad!'<br />
'I know,' answered Patrick, 'I <b>love to hear</b> you say it!'<br />
