* Lesson 69 But not murder!
#+begin_verse
Do you think that the writer passed his driving test? Why?

I was being tested for a driving licence for the third time.
I had been asked to drive in heavy traffic and had done so successfully.
After having *been instructed to drive* out of town, I began to acquire confidence.
Sure that I had passed, I was almost beginning to enjoy my test.
The examiner must have *been pleased with* my performance,
	for he smiled and said, 'Just one more thing, Mr. Eames.
*Let us suppose that* a child suddenly crosses the road in front of you.
As soon as I *tap on the window*, you must stop within five feet.'
I *continued driving* and after some time, the examiner tapped loudly.
Though the sound could be heard clearly, it took me a long time to react.
I suddenly pressed the brake pedal hard and we were both thrown forward.
The examiner looked at me sadly.
'Mr. Eames,' he said, in a mournful voice, 'you have just killed that child!'
