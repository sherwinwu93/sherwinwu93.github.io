<p class="verse">
Why did the policeman ask the writer to come to the police station?<br />
<br />
It must have been about two in the morning when I returned home.<br />
I tried to wake up my wife by ringing the doorbell,<br />
&#xa0;but she was <b>fast asleep</b>,<br />
&#xa0;so I got a ladder from the shed in the garden,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;put it against the wall, and began climbing towards the bedroom window.<br />
I was almost there when a sarcastic voice below said,<br />
&#xa0;'I don't think the windows need cleaning at this time of the night.'<br />
I looked down and nearly fell off the ladder when I saw a policeman.<br />
I immediately regretted answering in the way I did,<br />
&#xa0;but I said, 'I enjoy cleaning windows at night.'<br />
'So do I,' answered the policeman in the same tone.<br />
'Excuse my interrupting you.<br />
I <b>hate to interrupt</b> a man when he's busy working,<br />
&#xa0;but would you mind coming with me to the station?'<br />
'Well, I'd prefer to stay here,' I said.<br />
'You see. I've forgotten my key.'<br />
'Your what?' he called.<br />
'My key,' I shouted.<br />
Fortunately, the shouting woke up my wife who opened the window<br />
&#xa0;just as the policeman had started to climb towards me.<br />
