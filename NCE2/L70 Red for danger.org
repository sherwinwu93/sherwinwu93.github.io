* Lesson 70 Red for danger
#+begin_verse
How was the drunk removed from the ring?

During a bullfight, a drunk suddenly wandered into the middle of the ring.
The crowd began to shout, but the drunk *was unaware of* the danger.
The bull *was busy with the matador* *at the time*,
	but it suddenly *caught sight of* the drunk who was shouting rude remarks and waving a red cap.
Apparently *sensitive to* criticism,
	the bull forgot all about the matador and *charged at* the drunk.
The crowd suddenly *grew quiet*.
The drunk, however, seemed quite sure of himself.
When the bull *got close to him*, he clumsily *stepped aside* to let it pass.
The crowd *broke into cheers* and the drunk bowed.
By this time, however,
	three men had come into the ring and they quickly dragged the drunk to safety.
Even the bull seemed to *feel sorry for him*,
	for it *looked on* sympathetically
		until the drunk was *out of the way* before *once more* *turning its attention to the matador*.
