* Lesson 19 Sold out
#+begin_verse
When will the writer see the play?

'The play may begin at any moment,' I said.
'It may have begun already,' Susan answered.
I *hurried to the ticket office*.
'May I have two tickets please?' I asked.
'I'm sorry, we've *sold out*,' the girl said.
'*What a pity*!' Susan exclaimed.
Just then, a man hurried to the ticket office.
'Can I return these two tickets?' he asked.
'Certainly,' the girl said.
I went back to the ticket office *at once*.
'Could I have those two tickets please?' I asked.
'Certainly,' the girl said, 'but they're for next Wednesday's performance.
Do you still want them?'
'I *might as well* have them,' I said sadly.
