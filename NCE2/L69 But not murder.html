<p class="verse">
Do you think that the writer passed his driving test? Why?<br />
<br />
I was being tested for a driving licence for the third time.<br />
I had been asked to drive in heavy traffic and had done so successfully.<br />
After having <b>been instructed to drive</b> out of town, I began to acquire confidence.<br />
Sure that I had passed, I was almost beginning to enjoy my test.<br />
The examiner must have <b>been pleased with</b> my performance,<br />
&#xa0;for he smiled and said, 'Just one more thing, Mr. Eames.<br />
<b>Let us suppose that</b> a child suddenly crosses the road in front of you.<br />
As soon as I <b>tap on the window</b>, you must stop within five feet.'<br />
I <b>continued driving</b> and after some time, the examiner tapped loudly.<br />
Though the sound could be heard clearly, it took me a long time to react.<br />
I suddenly pressed the brake pedal hard and we were both thrown forward.<br />
The examiner looked at me sadly.<br />
'Mr. Eames,' he said, in a mournful voice, 'you have just killed that child!'<br />
