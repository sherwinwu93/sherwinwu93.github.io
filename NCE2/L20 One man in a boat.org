* Lesson 20 One man in a boat

#+begin_verse
Why is fishing the writer's favourite sport?

Fishing is my favourite sport.
I often fish for hours without catching anything.
But this does not worry me.
Some fishermen are unlucky.
*Instead of catching fish*, they catch old boots and rubbish.
I am even less lucky.
I never catch anything -- not even old boots.
After having *spent whole mornings on the river*,
	I always go home with an empty bag.
'You must *give up fishing*!' my friends say.
'It's a waste of time.
'But they don't realize one important thing.
*I'm not really interested* in fishing.
I am only interested in sitting in a boat and doing nothing at all.
