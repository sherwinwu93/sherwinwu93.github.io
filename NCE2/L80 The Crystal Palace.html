<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9893fcc">
<p class="verse">
How many people visited the Great Exhibition of 1851?<br />
<br />
Perhaps the most extraordinary building of the nineteenth century was the Crystal Palace,<br />
&#xa0;which was built in Hyde Park for the Great Exhibition of 1851.<br />
The Crystal Palace was different from all other buildings in the world,<br />
&#xa0;for it <b>was made of</b> iron and glass.<br />
It was one of the biggest buildings <b>of all time</b><br />
&#xa0;and a lot of people from many countries came to see it.<br />
A great many goods were sent to the exhibition from various parts of the world.<br />
There was also a great deal of machinery <b>on display</b>.<br />
The most wonderful piece of machinery on show was Nasmyth's steam hammer.<br />
Though in those days, traveling was not as easy as it is today,<br />
&#xa0;steam boats carried thousands of visitors across the Channel from Europe.<br />
On arriving in England, they were taken to the Crystal Palace by train.<br />
There were six million visitors <b>in all</b>,<br />
&#xa0;and the profits from the exhibition were used to build museums and colleges.<br />
Later, the Crystal Palace was moved to South London.<br />
It remained one of the most famous buildings in the world until it was burnt down in 1936.<br />

The Crystal Palace, which was built for the Great Exhibition of 1851,<br />
	was different from all others in the world<br />
	because it was made of iron and glass.<br />
Goods from various parts of the world were on display as well as a great deal of machinery.<br />
So many visitors came by boat and train<br />
	that it was possible to build colleges and museums from the profits.<br />
After the exhibition, the Crystal Palace was moved to South London,<br />
	where it remained util it was burnt down in 1936.<br />
