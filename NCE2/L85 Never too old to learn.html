How long has Mr. Page been teaching?<br />
<br />
I have just received a letter from my old school,<br />
&#xa0;<b>informing me</b> that my former headmaster, Mr. Stuart Page, will be retiring next week.<br />
Pupils of the school, old and new, will be sending him a present to <b>mark the occasion</b>.<br />
All those who have <b>contributed towards</b> the gift<br />
&#xa0;will sign their names in a large album which will be sent to the headmaster's home.<br />
We shall all <b>remember Mr. Page for</b> his patience and understanding<br />
&#xa0;and for the kindly encouragement he gave us when we went so unwillingly to school.<br />
A great many former pupils will be attending a farewell dinner <b>in his honour</b> next Thursday.<br />
<b>It is a curious coincidence that</b> the day before his retirement,<br />
&#xa0;Mr. Page will have been teaching for <b>a total of</b> forty years.<br />
After he has retired, he will <b>devote himself to gardening</b>.<br />
For him, this will be an entirely new hobby.<br />
But this does not matter,<br />
&#xa0;for, as he has often remarked, one is never too old to learn.<br />
