How did the woman get help?<br />
<br />
When a light passenger plane <b>flew off course</b> some time ago,<br />
&#xa0;it crashed in the mountains and its pilot was killed.<br />
The only passengers, a young woman and her two baby daughters, were unhurt.<br />
It was the middle of winter.<br />
Snow lay thick on the ground.<br />
The woman knew that the nearest village was miles away.<br />
When it grew dark,<br />
&#xa0;she turned a suitcase into a bed and put the children inside it,<br />
&#xa0;<b>covering them with</b> all the clothes she could find.<br />
During the night, it got terribly cold.<br />
The woman kept as near as she could to the children and even tried to get into the case herself,<br />
&#xa0;but it was too small.<br />
Early next morning, she heard planes passing overhead and wondered how she could <b>send a signal</b>.<br />
Then she had an idea.<br />
She <b>stamped out</b> the letters 'SOS' in the snow.<br />
Fortunately, a pilot saw the signal and sent a message by radio to the nearest town.<br />
<b>It was not long before</b><br />
&#xa0;a helicopter <b>arrived on the scene</b> to rescue the survivors of the plane crash.<br />
