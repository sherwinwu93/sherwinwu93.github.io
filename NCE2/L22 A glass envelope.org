How did Jane receive a letter from a stranger?

My daughter, Jane, never *dreamed of receiving* a letter from a girl *of her own age* in Holland.
Last year, we were travelling across the Channel
	and Jane put a piece of paper with her name and address on it into a bottle.
She threw the bottle into the sea.
She never *thought of* it again,
	but ten months later, she received a letter from a girl in Holland.
Both girls *write to each other* regularly now.
However, they have *decided to use* the post office.
Letters will cost a little more,
	but they will certainly travel faster.
