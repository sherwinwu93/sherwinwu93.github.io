* Lesson 84 On strike

#+begin_verse
Who will be driving the buses next week?

Busmen have decided to *go on strike* next week.
The strike *is due to* begin on Tuesday.
No one knows how long it will last.
*The busmen have stated*
	that the strike will continue
		until general *agreement is reached about* pay and working conditions.
Most people believe that the strike will last for at least a week.
Many owners of private cars are going to offer 'free rides' to people on their way to work.
This will *relieve pressure* on the trains *to some extent*.
Meanwhile, a number of university students have *volunteered to drive* buses while the strike lasts.
All the students are expert drivers,
	but before they drive any of the buses, they will have to *pass a special test*.
The students are going to *take the test* in two days' time.
Even so, people are going to find it difficult to get to work.
But so far, the public has *expressed its gratitude to* the students in letters to the Press.
*Only one or two people have objected* that the students will drive too fast!
