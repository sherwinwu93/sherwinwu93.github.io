* Lesson 94 Future champions
#+begin_verse
What kind of race do the children compete in?

*Experiments have proved*
	that children can *be instructed in swimming* at a very early age.
At a special swimming pool in Los Angeles,
	children become expert at *holding their breath* under water even before they can walk.
Babies of two months old do not appear to *be reluctant to enter* the water.
It is not long before
	they *are so accustomed to swimming* that they can pick up weights from the floor of the pool.
A game that *is very popular with* these young swimmers is the underwater tricycle race.
Tricycles *are lined up* on the floor of the pool seven feet under water.
The children *compete against* each other to reach the other end of the pool.
Many pedal their tricycles, but most of them prefer to push or drag them.
Some children can cover the whole length of the pool without coming up for breath even once.
Whether they will ever become future Olympic champions, only time will tell.
Meanwhile, they should encourage those among us
	who cannot swim five yards before they are gasping for air.
