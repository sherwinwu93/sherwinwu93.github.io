<p class="verse">
Why did the prisoner attack the driver?<br />
<br />
When he had killed the guard, the prisoner of war quickly dragged him into the bushes.<br />
Working rapidly in the darkness, he soon <b>changed into</b> the dead man's clothes.<br />
Now, dressed in a blue uniform and with a rifle over his shoulder,<br />
&#xa0;the prisoner marched boldly <b>up and down</b> in front of the camp.<br />
He could hear shouting in the camp itself.<br />
Lights were blazing and men were running here and there:<br />
&#xa0;they had just <b>discovered that</b> a prisoner had escaped.<br />
At that moment, a large black car with four officers inside it, stopped at the camp gates.<br />
The officers got out and the prisoner <b>stood to attention</b> and saluted as they passed.<br />
When they had gone, the driver of the car came towards him.<br />
The man obviously wanted to talk.<br />
He was rather elderly with grey hair and clear blue eyes.<br />
The prisoner felt sorry for him, but there was nothing else he could do.<br />
As the man came near,<br />
&#xa0;the prisoner <b>knocked him to the ground</b> <b>with a sharp blow</b>.<br />
Then, jumping into the car, he drove off as quickly as he could.<br />
