<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5810653">
<p class="verse">
Who will be driving the buses next week?<br />
<br />
Busmen have decided to <b>go on strike</b> next week.<br />
The strike <b>is due to</b> begin on Tuesday.<br />
No one knows how long it will last.<br />
<b>The busmen have stated</b><br />
&#xa0;that the strike will continue<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;until general <b>agreement is reached about</b> pay and working conditions.<br />
Most people believe that the strike will last for at least a week.<br />
Many owners of private cars are going to offer 'free rides' to people on their way to work.<br />
This will <b>relieve pressure</b> on the trains <b>to some extent</b>.<br />
Meanwhile, a number of university students have <b>volunteered to drive</b> buses while the strike lasts.<br />
All the students are expert drivers,<br />
&#xa0;but before they drive any of the buses, they will have to <b>pass a special test</b>.<br />
The students are going to <b>take the test</b> in two days' time.<br />
Even so, people are going to find it difficult to get to work.<br />
But so far, the public has <b>expressed its gratitude to</b> the students in letters to the Press.<br />
<b>Only one or two people have objected</b> that the students will drive too fast!<br />

The busmen's strike, which begins on Tuesday,<br />
	may last for a week.<br />
Because of this,<br />
	 cars owners have offered to give rides to people going to work.<br />
University students, too, have volunteered to drive the buses too<br />
	but they will have to pass a special test.<br />
Though it will be difficult to get to work, the public is grateful to the students.<br />
Only one or two people have objected that the students will drive too fast.<br />
