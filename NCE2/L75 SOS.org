* Lesson 75 SOS
#+begin_verse
How did the woman get help?

When a light passenger plane *flew off course* some time ago,
	it crashed in the mountains and its pilot was killed.
The only passengers, a young woman and her two baby daughters, were unhurt.
It was the middle of winter.
Snow lay thick on the ground.
The woman knew that the nearest village was miles away.
When it grew dark,
	she turned a suitcase into a bed and put the children inside it,
	*covering them with* all the clothes she could find.
During the night, it got terribly cold.
The woman kept as near as she could to the children and even tried to get into the case herself,
	but it was too small.
Early next morning, she heard planes passing overhead and wondered how she could *send a signal*.
Then she had an idea.
She *stamped out* the letters 'SOS' in the snow.
Fortunately, a pilot saw the signal and sent a message by radio to the nearest town.
*It was not long before*
	a helicopter *arrived on the scene* to rescue the survivors of the plane crash.

A light passenger plane crashed in the mountains,
	but the only passengers, a woman and her two baby daughters, were not hurt.
It was Mid winter and extremely cold,
	so she put children in a case, covered them with clothes
		and kept close to them all night.
When planes passed overhead next morning, she stamped out 'SOS' in the snow.
This was seen by a pilot, who sent the message to nearest village,
	and the passengers were soon rescued by a helicopter.
