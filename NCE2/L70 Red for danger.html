How was the drunk removed from the ring?<br />
<br />
During a bullfight, a drunk suddenly wandered into the middle of the ring.<br />
The crowd began to shout, but the drunk <b>was unaware of</b> the danger.<br />
The bull <b>was busy with the matador</b> <b>at the time</b>,<br />
&#xa0;but it suddenly <b>caught sight of</b> the drunk who was shouting rude remarks and waving a red cap.<br />
Apparently <b>sensitive to</b> criticism,<br />
&#xa0;the bull forgot all about the matador and <b>charged at</b> the drunk.<br />
The crowd suddenly <b>grew quiet</b>.<br />
The drunk, however, seemed quite sure of himself.<br />
When the bull <b>got close to him</b>, he clumsily <b>stepped aside</b> to let it pass.<br />
The crowd <b>broke into cheers</b> and the drunk bowed.<br />
By this time, however,<br />
&#xa0;three men had come into the ring and they quickly dragged the drunk to safety.<br />
Even the bull seemed to <b>feel sorry for him</b>,<br />
&#xa0;for it <b>looked on</b> sympathetically<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;until the drunk was <b>out of the way</b> before <b>once more</b> <b>turning its attention to the matador</b>.<br />

A drunk suddenly wandered into the middle of the ring during a bullfight<br />
	and shouted rude remarks and waved a red cap.<br />
Ignoring the matador, the bull charged at him, but he stepped aside to let it pass.<br />
The crowd cheered, and the drunk bowed.<br />
Just after this, three men dragged the drunk to safety<br />
	while the bull looked on sympathetically<br />
		before it once more turned its attention to the matador.<br />
