We began by talking compassion, about
other people mattering to us. And what we did in our last lecture is we
looked at empathy. Putting yourself in another person's
shoes. And we explored the extent to which
empathy can drive compassion, and can drive
morality more generally. And I actually think any complete theory
of our moral life has to draw upon empathy. Has to draw upon this putting ourselves in another's shoes?

But I also think it's a lot more
complicated than that. I think that there are limits to empathy. There are limits to empathy which make it unreliable and untenable as a source for
morality. To put it differently, to the extent we're good people and we live good and moral
lives. Sometimes we will rely on empathy but
sometimes we'll reject empathy. So, why do we want to do that?

Well, one thing is, empathy is biased. we, we feel a lot more affection, a lot
more empathy for a, a, a kitten than for a
piglet. We feel a lot more empathy for a panda
than for a chicken. This is not because of a deep reason moral argument about suffering and pain and
intelligence and feelings. It's because some things are adorable,
some things trigger our emotions. But part of what it is to be a moral person is sometimes overriding the fact that,
that we feel warmly towards this but not that and ask
ourselves deeper questions having to do with
suffering and pain. Maybe you're not convinced. Maybe you think we should rescue the
kitten, no matter what. But what about people?

So, I don't think there are many people
who will defend this, which is that in the
courtroom, ju-, juries are particularly biased in favor of defendants who are physically
attractive and who are baby-faced. Because our emotional response to attractiveness and baby-facedness, the
looks of youth, is innocence, is innocence and
sweetness and compassion. But surely somebody who is ugly and kind
of griseled deserves just as fair a
treatment. So, it seems there's an unfair world in
which a young Leonardo DiCaprio would be acquitted of any crime, because
of how his face resonates to us.

More generally I think part of what goes
on when we make a correct moral decision involves
overriding our empathetic feelings. And in some cases, it's pretty clear that
empathy could drive us not just to the incorrect choice, but actually
to a straight-out immoral act. In part because it could pull our
attention towards the one and away from the many. so, so, remember the study I told you
about before saying, that we could more about one person than
about five people. Particularly one person if you could see
that person. But that's crazy. That's morally crazy. We shouldn't be swayed.
Everyone has a face. Everybody has a name. Providing a name and a, and a, and a face sways us, but that's not the way it should
work.

If you think for minute that, that, that
the way to be a good person is try to help the most people,
then will often lead you astray. And actually one of the studies by Dam
Batson illustrates this. So remember, we talked about his study
where there's a girl, and she's waiting in line for an
operation and if you take her perspective you move her
up the line. But as Batson points out nobody think's
it's the right thing to move her up the line. Nobody thinks, say for a list of people
waiting in line for a heart transplant, you should
walk and look at all of them and whoever inspires
your feelings the most you should give em the heart
transplant first. That's not right, it's not right because what inspires your feelings has to do with things like attractiveness and
baby-facedness and whether the person's the same color,
whether the person same background as you. What you want to do to have a moral system
is, you have a system that, that, that doesn't
take certain things into account. That is based on, on reason and not, and
not gut feelings.

Now, these are examples where empathy is
biased and empathy could lead you astray. But there's also another argument, which
is that for a lot of what's core to our morality,
empathy is not enough. Empathy is limited.
And I'll give you a few examples of this. One is example is sort of is, is kind of
particular, but I think it's telling. It, it, it is something pointed out by
William James. So James talks about our relationships with our
dogs. Many people have dogs as pets. They feel very affectionate towards them. They, they, they love them and they care
about them. But James points out, this is not a
relationship that's founded on empathy. If my dog, I don't know whether my dog
ever tries to take my perspective. Here's here's me and my, and my, my dog. I don't know if she ever tries to take my
perspective but I don't think she does. And if she does, I don't thinks he would
have any understanding of what I do all day which is mostly sit in front of
the computer and go like this. And I don't really take her perspective
very much either because her life is a mystery to
me. She seems to spend all of her voluntary time sniffing at disgusting things and
trying to eat disgusting things and it's just
strange. And yet, and yet I care a lot for her. And I'd like to think she cares a lot for
me. And James' point is, that you would have
a, you know, a personal relationship, relationships
founded on love and compassion without empathy. Consider again, as maybe a more salient
example, ones relationship with ones baby. Soon empathy emerges and, and, and, and
there's a synchrony and so on, but from the get go there's none of
that. But still there can be an enormous amount
of love.

A lot of this sort of personal ideals,
that matter to us most, don't have as much to do with empathy as
one might first think. Now empathy is a particular, sorry, is
particularly weak, when it comes to our finest moral
ideals. When it comes to more general policy, and particularly when it comes to our
treatment of strangers. And some of the weaknesses of empathy are
nicely summarized by Steven Pinker, in his wonderful book Better Angels of our
Nature, which we'll talk about later on in the class. So Pinker writes, I can't say that it's
empathy that prevents me from taking out contracts on my critics, getting the fistfights over
parking spaces, or threatening my wife when she points out
I've dong something silly. My mind doesn't stop and ponder what it
would be like to be the victims of these kind of violence and then
recoil after feeling the victim's pain. Rather, my mind never goes in those
directions in the first place. Pinker goes on to say that, you know, the Old Testament says you should love thy
neighbor. The New Testament says you should love thy
enemy. But frankly, he doesn't love either one of
them. He loves the people he loves. But most of the world, his neighbors, his
enemies and so on, he doesn't love them at all. And I, I don't love my, most of my
neighbors and my enemies either, but we are moral towards
them, we don't kill them. In some situations we will help them, we
will sacrifice to help them. And this shows that feelings have their
limits. That, that sometimes our morality is
grounded in, not in gut feelings, but in moral
principles.

And the importance of moral principles,
the importance of moral reason, and the limits
of gut feelings, are actually nicely
illustrated in a story told by, yes, by Adam Smith. And I'm going to present his story. I'm going to modify it slightly for a more
modern age. Imagine you learn about a death of sa-,
thousands of strangers. Imagine you learn it, I mean Smith wrote in the 1700s, but imagine you learn
yourself, right. You open up your computer, you put on your computer browser, and out comes some
new stories. And one of news stories is in a country
that you don't belong to. India, Argentina United States you know,
Australia. Some place you don't know about.
Some place that is not where you are. Thousands of people died.
They died of a salmonella epidemic, they died of an earthquake, they
died of, of a factory fire. How would you respond? Well, this actually isn't so strange to
you, because if you open up your browser every day, thousands
of people often die. So how do you respond? Well, I bet, I bet you, you know you say,
oh, well that's too bad. That's unfortunate. Then you go about your business.
And Adam Smith says that, that when exposed to the death of thousand
of strangers. We will remark our disapproval, and say,
oh, how what a terrible world, and then we will go on our life, and that night we will sleep with the most profound
serenity.

Now, imagine something different. Imagine instead, you were to learn that
tomorrow you are going to lose your little finger. You can't see, so this is Smith's example, that tomorrow there going to chop off your little
finger. You would say wow. You would say, wow, you would say, that's
terrible. That's, that's, how am I going to, are
they going to anesthesia? Which finger, which? How are they going to, why?
What? And that night you wouldn't sleep a wink. So plainly, from a gut feeling, from an
emotional response, the loss of your little finger matters more than the death
of thousands of strangers.

So this raises a question then, and a
question is this: Since it matters so much more, this loss of a finger than
the death of a thousand strangers. Would it follow that someone would
sacrifice thousands of lives to save his little
finger? And Smith writes, human nature startles
with horror at the thought. His answer is no, nobody would do that.

Look I'll even change the example. If you're extremely fond of your little
finger maybe you would do that. I'll change the example. You discover that thousands of people are
going to die, you say, oh, how sad, they've died, how sad, but also you
notice your computer is slow. Your browser is slow.
It's very frustrating. It's slow, it's unreliable, maybe your
connection's fading in and out. It does not seem implausible, in fact it
seems true, that that slow connection's going to
bother you a lot more, than learning by the death of
thousands of people. But still, if somebody, if you were
offered then to speed up your connection, but thousands of people
would die, you would say that's insane.

So, here's the question then, and this is
a question asked by Adam Smith. When our passive feelings are almost
always so sordid and so selfish, how comes it that our active principles
should often be so generous and so noble? And Smith continues, it is reason,
principle, conscience; this calls to us, with a voice capable of
astonishing the most presumptuous of our passions, That we are
but one of the multitude, in no respect better than
any other in it. And this last phrase sums up morality.
What a sophisticated morality is goes beyond gut feelings and
selfish urges and desires to help people. But it also includes an understanding that
we are but one of the multitude, in no respect better
than any other in it. And what you see in moral systems all
around the world, from religion, from philosophy, is an appreciation that a
moral code doesn't care about you as special.
A moral code says, you're not special. It says that we have to figure out how to
live our lives such e-, e-, in a way that would
somehow apply to everybody. So this shows up in all of the versions of
the golden rule. And all of Confucian statements about impartiality. It shows up in the consequentialism that
we talked about, where the, the right way to live is to try to increase overall amount of pleasure and decrease overall amount of
pain. It shows up in in Kant's categorical
imperative. Where you should have a principle that
applies to everybody that would make the world better
all around. It applies to theories like John Rawls' Veil of Ignorance or Adam
Smiths own Impartial Spectator.

Now, it might sound like this is some sort
of technical idea that, that only, you know,
gurus and, and, and great intellects could think about, but in
some sense, this is, this is a common sense that's accessible
to all of us. We all appreciate that the right thing to
do is often not about appealing to our gut
and appealing to our immediate feelings and
prejudices, but, but also to, to take the bigger view.
And my favorite summary of this is from Rick Blaine, the character played by
Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca. And so the movie ends, sort of spoiler alert because I'm going to show you a
clip. The movie ends with him talking about a
sacrifice he must make, he and his, and his lover must make and why they must
make it. [MUSIC] We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we, we lost it until you
came to Casablanca. We got it back last night. >> And I said I would never leave you.
>> And you never will. But I got a job to do too. And where I'm going, you can't follow. What I've got to do, you can't be any part
of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble. But it doesn't take much to see that the
problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of
beans in this crazy world. >> That is an astonishingly rich philosophical
statement. And the fact that we could understand it,
that we could understand that the problems of
three little people don't amount to a hill of beans, compared
to everything else that's going on shows that
we're moral creatures. And making this sort of argument and
extending this sort of argument back and forth to each other, is an example of how reason
could play a role in our moral lives.

So I started off, in the last week,
talking about the power of gut feelings, the power of
emotions and morality. Providing demonstration after
demonstration after demonstration of how emotion shapes our moral reasoning and our
moral action, and yet all of that's true. But now we're starting to encounter the
power of reason. The power of reason that says that, yeah I
know I favor this over that. I know I'm empathetic towards that, this
rather than that. I know my selfish desires go for this
rather than that. But I recognize that it's wrong. I recognize that there are higher moral
principles at work, there are higher moral principles
at stake. I may be happier if I save my little
finger and a thousand people could die and but know
that, that's wrong. I know that that's wrong because I know
the people, the, the thousand other people are sons
and fathers and mothers and daughter just as much as I am and the
people I love are. And a appreciation of both the power of the emotions and the power of reason and
rationality leads us to I think a more sophisticated understanding of what goes on in our moral
lives. And I think now focusing on the interplay of emotion and reason, makes moral psychology a lot more
interesting. [MUSIC]
