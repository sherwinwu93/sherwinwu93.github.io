The first case study of the role of emotions in influencing morality, is the
case of disgust. I've long been interested in, in this
unusual emotion. Paul Rozzen, who's the world's leading
scholar, in a study of disgust, describes it as the body and
soul of emotion. Disgust is a human universal.
It shows up in every culture. You can see it showing up in people's
faces. So, wherever you are when you're shown something disgusting, you'll make the
classic face. It starts with ugh, and what will elicit
this face, wherever you are, is the same sorts
of things. Feces, urine, blood, vomit, rotten flesh, and most meat.
When you're disgusted by something, you don't want to touch it. You, you, you don't want to smell it, and
you certainly don't want to eat it. You don't want it in your mouth.
The idea of eating it. The, the, the look of it ,uh ,a dead rat,
some vomit, dog feces. If you're too close to it, you'll gag. You might feel nauseous at the thought of
it. In the extreme, something sufficiently
disgusting could make you vomit, and it will, always
elicit this distinctive emotion, this distinctive
feeling, that we identify, as disgust.

Evolutionary psychologists, interested in
emotions, have argued that this feeling evolved for a certain
function. It evolved to motivate us, to avoid
parasites and poisons. So you think of the things that we are disgusted by, and they share certain
things in common. And what they share in common is that,
they are dangerous to us, but they aren't dangerous to us like a, a charging lion is
dangerous to us or, or steep cliff, rather they could poison us, they, they
have infectious properties. And so, you don't want, you, you, you, you
have, want to move away from it.

Now, if this was, all there was to say
about disgust, it would have no role in a
discussion of morality. But, one of the most troubling facts about
disgust, is that people can be disgusting. And this was something pointed out by
Charles Darwin, who was always a wonderful and acute
observer of of human interaction. And, and of his own feelings. So he writes, in Tierra del Fuego a native
touched with his finger, some cold preserved meat and
plainly showed disgust, as its softness. Whilst I felt utter disgust at my food
being touched by a naked savage, though his hands did
not appear dirty. People are disgusting. Our response to strangers, our response to
being touched by strangers, to, to smelling strangers and so on, is often
a response of disgust. Now, there's some debate in the field as
to, why people elicit disgust. Some scholars say, people elicit disgust
because people carry diseases. Strange people will carry strange
diseases. So it's, it's a plausible biological
adaptation to say, we want to get away from those
strange people. Others argue that it's not really that,
rather, people are disgusting because we are
fleshy things. We are made of meat. We, we, we produce feces, and urine, and
other things. And this is an old observation my Latin
pronunciation is, is terrible, but Saint Augustine is credited with the phrase,
Inter faeces et urinam nascimur from feces and urine, we are born. We, we are, we are animal like things and
if you think of people in that way, you can be readily
disgusted by them. Once you are disgusted by them, it can have moral effects, it could have
consequences and the consequences of being disgusted by somebody, of being disgusted
by a group of people, are profoundly
negative.

Every genocidal movement that, that has
left a record, exhibits signs that disgust was used, to elicit
hatred towards the despised group. Most movements involving prejudice and
discrimination, don't just say those people, they're rotten, they're
stupid, they're mean. They also say, they're disgusting. This is an insight that the philosopher
Martha Nessbaum, nicely summarizes. Throughout history, certain disgust
properties, sliminess, bad smell, stickiness, decay, foulness, have repeatedly and monotonously
been associated with Jews, women, homosexuals, untouchables, lower class
people. All of those are imagined as tainted, by
the dirt of the body. and, and this is an example from Nazi
propaganda. But there are, are countless such
examples, where a despised group is described as,
disgusting. There seems to be a natural connection to being disgusted by somebody and, not
caring about them. In fact, wanting them to suffer.

Psychologists have studied disgust in the
lab. And there's different ways to do it. So, one way to do it is, you can see how
easily disgusted people are, and then see how much their disgust sensitivity,
predicts other properties about them. And some of the best work here was done by
Paul Ross and Jonathan Hype and their colleagues, and what they
did was, they developed a disgust scale. And this scale, we, you could take the
scale and then you could see how easily
disgusted you are. It's readily available online. I'll give you some, I'll give you a couple
of typical questions.

So, one question and you have to answer,
how bad would this be? So one question is you have to pick up a
dead cat with your hands. Now for me, I'd like rather die. I'd rather go kill myself, this is awful. Other people say what's the big deal,
scoop it up, who cares? You get great differences in this. Here's another item.
I love this one. You, you sit on, you sit on a bus seat, and it's still warm from the last person
who was there. Now, I mean, I say, who cares? You know, if it's winter, it's nice. I was raised in Montreal.
That sounds kind of, it's warm, it's good. Other people say, oh, my God, it's
horrible. That's why I don't take the bus. Other people's warmth.
And so, you get these differences. So you get people to scale. And then you can rank them, on how easily
they're disgusted.

And it turns out that, that your disgust sensitivity is related to certain
interesting facts about you. Women, on average, are more disgust
sensitive, than men. there's, there's evidence that women
become particularly disgust sensitive, at a certain vulnerable point
in pregnancy. Political conservatives, tend to be more disgust sensitive, than political
liberals. And most important for what we're talking
about here, your disgust sensitivity corresponds
to, certain moral attitudes. So for instance, in some, some research
finds, that people who are very disgust
sensitive, are more likely to be, express negative moral
attitudes about homosexuals. Now, these studies are correlational. You look at, at how people rate something. You look at another attitude, and
correlational studies are, could always be a lot of different things
going on. Maybe there's some third factor that's
causing, both the disgust sensitivity and the
negative attitudes. So, you're better off with experimental
studies.

And there's actually been a lot of
experimental studies which induce disgust, and then see, what sort of effect it has.
So, one study which I've done, in collaboration with various psychologists,
it was lead by David Pizzaro at Cornell University involved getting people in, in, in a room and they answer questions
about different things, about tax policy, about
immigrants, and about gay people. What do they think about gay people. And some people just sit in the room and
answer the questions. But other people, before they get in a room, they room is sprayed with a fart
spray. So, they come in the room. They say, oh this is really a gross room,
you're testing me in. And then, they get the questions. Turns out, being grossed out by this fart
spray, doesn't influence your feelings about tax policy. And it doesn't influence your feelings
about the environment or, or other things. But it does affect, how you think about
groups like homosexuals. It makes you harsher towards them. It also makes you harsher towards moral violations, you could called purity
violations. Like consensual incest or or masturbation
in an inappropriate place or stuff like that. If you're disgusted, you're more
disapproving.

And these studies suggest that, your
feelings about somebody or, or what somebody does, can be influenced
by your emotional state. In particular, your emotional state of disgust. Now disgust can also influence certain
specific moral judgments. So, so far I've been talking more or less
about, moral feelings towards somebody.

But what about judgments about, what's
right and wrong? Well, Jonathan Haidt thought up some very
interesting examples. And he uses these examples to show that, even people who think, that they're very
liberal and quite consequential, can be influenced in
their judgments of morality, by whether or not, something
disgusts them. And I'll give you the examples that he
uses. The first one is a brother and sister
case. Julie and Mark are our sister and brother.
They're adults, they travel together. They find themselves, say in France on
vacation, and they decide to have sex with one another. Now, they're very cognizant of worries of
having pregnancy and so on, so they use tons of birth
control. There's no chance, that, that, that she'll
get pregnant. And they have sex and it's great. And they do it several times, and they
just love it. And then they decide, they're not going to
tell anybody, and and they're not going to do
it again. And that's the end of the story. Did Julie and Mark do something wrong?
Morally wrong? So think about, how you would answer that. Case Two, family dog.
This isn't what you expect. Family dog runs out in the street, gets
hit by a car. Family brings the dog in, very sad. But then they realize, they have nothing
planned for supper tonight. So they cook the dog and eat it. And it's delicious, and they're very
happy. Have they done anything wrong? Third case, flag in toilet.
The toilet is very dirty but this guy has run out of cleaning
supplies, and wants to clean the toilet. Fortunately, he has an American flag. If you're not from America, choose your
own country for this. Takes the flag and uses it, to scrub the toiler clean.
Now he's happy, clean toilet. Has he done anything wrong?
Fourth case, chicken. Now the first three cases have been done
in various, sort of fixed up forms, with young
children. The chicken case, was not done with young
children. The chicken case is, this guy goes to supermarket, he buys a chicken, he brings the chicken back
home. It's not a live chicken, like a chicken,
like you, from the supermarket, he makes love to the chicken,
has sex with the chicken. And then he cooks it and eats it.
Has he done something wrong? I'm not asking you, whether he's done
something which grosses you out. I, I imagine, you have an answer to that. Has he done anything wrong?

Now, what Haidt finds is, for these sorts
of examples, he finds a couple of things. First thing is that, most people, almost
everybody find so many things wrong, they find them
morally wrong. The exceptions are liberal, highly liberal
students from elite universities. Some of them say no, those are all okay,
no one's harmed. But most people, almost everybody, find
them wrong. But he also finds, that people are, not usually able to explain, what
they find, wrong about them. And he calls this, moral dumbfounding.
So for instance, you take the incest case. And so, Haidt interviews these people and
his say, they'd say, oh that's horribly wrong, they
shouldn't be doing that. And then Haidt, or his research assistants
ask, why? And they'll say something, well, she might
get pregnant. And then the research assistant says, well
no, there's plenty of birth control that they
use. And the person might say, well, it could
fail and then you'd have a deformed baby. That would be wrong. And then they say, well, what if they were
brothers, so they wouldn't get pregnant? And people say, no, that's still not
right, that's awful. Other people will find out. And what, what, what Haidt points out is that, people sort of struggle, to find an
explanation. And he argues, they're unwilling to sort of come
to terms with the fact that, there isn't really a reason, in the
normal sense, for their repugnance. Rather, their reaction is because these
things disgust them. And because they're disgusting, they're
found to be immoral. And if he's right, this would be a case
where, our emotions and not our reason, are driving moral
judgment. [MUSIC]
