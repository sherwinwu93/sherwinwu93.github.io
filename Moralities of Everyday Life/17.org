My own research looks at a lot of
different issues, but I, I've always been interested
in developmental psychology. I've always been interested in the minds
of babies and young children, toddlers. And how they think about things,how they learn language, how their social lives
develop. I find it interesting for a lot of
reasons. I think it the question of development itself is fascinating. How do you get from this tiny creature to
where we are now? The question of what it's like to be a
baby. What it's like to be a toddler is for me
irresistable. I was once one of those but I can't
remember and, and I've been trying to figure out what their mental lives are
like is to me an exhilarating project.
But I'm also interested in development because
it's a way to explore fundamental questions of
human nature.

And this is I think particularly the case
when it comes to morality.
So, early on we talked about moral
universals and moral diversity. And we said, you know, it could be
cultural. It could be learned. They could be inventions that, that people
pass on from one to another. But another possibility is that it could
be evolved. It could be a part of natural selection. Almost certainly, the answer's going to be
both. Some will, would be cultural, some would
be evolutionary.

But which is which, and how could we tell? We spent a couple lectures looking at evolutionary theory and how evolutionary
theory provides us with a way of thinking about how these
things could come to be.
But that doesn't really mean that, that
this is what actually happened. Well, one way to find out is
developmentally. One way to find out is by looking at how morality emerges in babies and
young children. Because, for the most part, if something is the product of culture, it'll emerge
late. It'll emerge as a child becomes, goes to
school, and church, and learns from his parents and gradually
becomes part of society. Well, if it evolved, it's at least
possible that it'll show very early. That the neurological development that gives rise to what will
pop out early. So at least possible to find some morality
in babies and young children.

An idea that this could be the case is something which has intrigued people for a
long time. A lot of philosophers are inhabitant
purists. They believe that there is, the mind is a
blank slate. That morality comes from outside, but
there always been some deep thinkers who have been sympathetic to the idea that we are
born with some sort of moral capacity. One of my favorite examples here is Thomas
Jefferson. So, you know, writing at the time of Adam Smith and
other great moral philosophers, moral psychologists,
Jefferson speculated in a letter to a friend that, the moral sense, or
conscience, is as much a part of man as his leg or arm. It is given to all human beings in a
stronger or weaker degree, as force of members is given them in a
lesser, a greater or lesser degree.

And we've already seen some of that. We've already seen some of that when we
talked about empathy and compassion.
What we've seen is a bit of evidence that
for babies and for children, the pain of others is
painful for them. They see somebody crying they're likely to
cry themselves. They're likely to be moved themselves. we, we also see very early on this, this
motive to pat, to comfort, to soothe the pain of
others. We see early on some degree of Altruism,
off kindness, of helping, of handing over a toy or handing
over some food. Not to everybody but to those close to
you. And this suggests to, to some extent some
of our moral sentiments and moral motivations are
present very early on, and that to some extent Jefferson is
right.

But, and here's an actually an example of
this sort of altruism. This is from an experiment by Felix
Varnaken and Michael Tomasello.
And and it, it involves a child being put in a situation where
someone is in some sort of mild stress and Varnaken
and Tomasello were interested Would children
spontaneously help, and you can see what they do here.
[SOUND] Oh. Hmm. >> [SOUND] [UNKNOWN].

>> Now, a different facet of morality is what Francis Hutchinson, who was Adam Smith's advisor called a moral sense. So, so far when talking with babies and
kids, we're talking about sensitivities, and
proclivities, feeling empathy, altruism. Hutchison meant something different by the moral sense. He meant it as a way to call a perceptual
capacity. The capacity not to be motivated to do
good and avoid doing bad, but rather to tell
the difference. To to identify goodness and badness in the
world. It turns out that the origin of the moral sense, the origin, the capacity to judge
good and evil is a topic that my colleagues and I are
very interested in. So what I'm going to do for, for much of
the rest of the lecture certainly, I will not do any other time,
either before or after this lecture. Which is, I'm going to talk a little bit about some research that I've been
involved in. because I'm excited about it, and because I think it speaks directly to these
questions.

The, our initial work was done with my
collaborator my collaborator's Karen Wynn, who runs the Yale Infant Studies Lab. And a post-doc, now a professor, Valerie
Cormier.
And in collaboration with Cormier, we were
interested first in how children make sense of social
interactions. So our first question, I'll present it to
set-up the study that'll follow, wasn't a
particularly moral question.

We weren't actually interested in whether children appreciated someone is, who is
helped, is more likely to to approach that which
helped it. While someone who is hindered is more
likely to approach that who hindered it.
And so I'll show you the same films that
the babies saw. This is what a baby might see. [BLANK_AUDIO] And then babies would be shown videos
where the character approaches either that which helped it, or that which
hindered it. And as babies saw these videos, their
looking time was measured as to how long they look at the
different scenes. Logic being that babies will typically look longer at something that surprising
or unusual and shorter at something which is
expected. And we found in the study is for both nine
month olds and 12 month olds, they look longer when a character
approaches that which hindered it, versus that which
helped it. Suggested they expect characters to to
approach that, those who help and not those who hinder. That the, the movies you saw, that
characters had faces. If you do the same study and don't have faces, the
results are much messier Nine month olds don't show an
effect at all. And at twelve month olds looking flips in
a strange way. And I think this is what, what goes on
here. It's, the faces mark this off as social
interaction not just a movement of things but as a social
interaction. And when babies see this as social interaction, it triggers their
social understanding. And they think of it in terms of helping and hindering, and approaching and
avoiding, and so on. And this is some, somewhat relevant maybe
to moral psychology.

But the real connection comes in when
Kylie Hamlin who's now, who was then a graduate student working
with Karen and with myself. And is now at, at University of British
Columbia on the faculty there. Said, you know, there's sort of a simpler question, which is much cooler, we could
ask. What do babies themselves think of these characters?
Can babies morally evaluate them? That is, you have a situation where one
character seems for an adult at least be good guy, a helping guy, and the other one where the
where the character seems to be a bad guy, a
hindering guy. And if you asked me to chose who's the nicer one, who's the worst one, it's kind
of easy. Would it be easy for the babies?

Now to ask that you have to move to a
different sort of display in which there are sort of three dimensional
movements. So were three dimensional characters. So now we're not testing looking time,
we're testing reaching. And the logic is, you show babies the good
guy and the bad guy, and you see who they prefer
to reach for. And this is an example of one of the
studies. [SOUND] >> Alright, he's doing great. Have to be ready, up goes to curtain.
[SOUND] >> And here's some information about the choices babies go
through. Now, it's important when designing this
sort of experiment to make sure you're testing what you think
you're testing. So we were interested in whether babies
were responding differentially to the good guy versus the
bad guy. But to do this as a proper experiment, you have to make sure that they aren't
responding to their favorite color or their favorite
shape, or they prefer the right to the left, and so on. So an easy experiment you carefully control or counter balance
where the items are. So if a, if one baby sees you know, a
triangle as the good guy, the other baby will see the
square as the good guy. And vice versa. Also when babies make their choices, the
person offering the choices to the baby doesn't herself know who the good guy
or the bad guy was. And this is to avoid the possibility of
unconscious queueing. And finally, parents close their eyes when the baby
makes a choice so they themselves can't queue the baby
one way or another. So this is a little example of what it
looks like when a baby makes a choice. [BLANK_AUDIO] And here are the results. And as you can see, for both the, the ten
month olds and the six month olds, babies reach for the good guy more
often than they reach for the bad guy. And this is not a subtle effect, this is a
big effect.

Now some of you are wondering, you think
this could be for a couple of reasons. It could be that they like the good guy and their reaching for the good guy, or it
could be they don't like the bad guy so their
avoiding the bad guy and choosing the one that's
not the bad guy, or it could be both. And to explore this you could imag, you
could compare how do they respond to a good guy versus a neutral guy
who doesn't do anything. They prefer the good guy. And a bad guy versus a neutral guy who
doesn't do anything. Now they prefer the neutral guy. Suggesting that, that even the youngest
kids, there's two forces at work. Babies are in favor of the good guy, and
they are, find it aversive to deal with the bad guy.

Now, we did a whole series of studies
looking at going up the hill, going down the hill. and, you know, there were a lot of
criticisms, legitimate ones, saying maybe there's
something funny about the hill. Maybe there's something odd about the
stimuli, this experiment. Maybe it's not morality at all but
direction or gravity, or something else that babies are
responding to. And for the most part these are perfectly legitimate arguments. We don't want to base a strong conclusion
on a single study. So what we've been doing over the last few years, is different sort of good guy, bad
guy interactions. And, and, and finding what to say in
result. So I'll just show you one example. And I will let you people of the internet
figure out yourselves. Act like a baby. Who do you think the good guy and who do
you think the bad guy is? [BLANK_AUDIO] [LAUGH] I would predict that you like our
babies, would assume that the puppet who gave the
ball back is the good guy And the puppet who
ran away from the ball is the bad guy. And in, that is, in fact what babies at
the same age we study with the hill climbing,
what babies believe. Now does this count as morality? Is this the, the foundation for moral
understanding? I'm just going to show you a little clip
of a baby making a choice here.
Simply because it's adorable.

So does this count as morality?
You know, we don't know for sure. Is this the foundation for later on, your
judgement and my judgement, that person's a good person,
that person's a bad person. It's unclear. It's very hard to disentangle morality
from preference. And as you'll remember from very first
lecture even philosophers have definition of
morality to draw upon.

But you'll also remember from the first lecture that morality is
related to certain things. Among other things it's related to notions
of reward and punishment. If we see something that's morally good,
we'd like to reward it. And if we see something that's morally
bad, we'd like to punish it. And it turns out babies want to do the
same thing. These actually are not babies, they're
slightly older toddlers. And what we did is we did experiments
where babies would watch characters do good things and bad things, and either
give a treat to one of them or take away a treat from one of
them. And what we found was when they saw a good
character and had to a bad character and had to reward, they
would tend to reward the good character. When they saw a good character and bad
character and had to punish, they would prefer to punish
the bad character. Suggesting that ease of evaluations are
not just sort of cold-blooded preferences, but rather sort
of linked up to systems that at least for adults, we would describe as
moral. I focused here on work from our lab,
because I, I think it's interesting and I'm
familiar with it. But more and more people have been using
these same sorts of methods, the same methods
that, that you use to study infant development in
general, to look at all sorts of moral understandings and
how they developed.

And I'll end by telling you one very nice study by a Marco Schmidt and Jessica
Summerville. And this also involved babies expectations
about goodness and badness. But now they weren't interested in in, you
know, helping and hindering or or stealing and giving back,
they were interested in fairness. And so what they didn't studied was they
showed babies one of two arrays. And in these arrays, characters would
either split something evenly to two other people, two
and two, or unevenly, one and three. And this is with 15-month olds, 15-month
old babies. And what they found was babies would look
longer, indicating surprise when the split was one to three, rather
than being two two. Now, you can skeptically say, well, maybe
just they look longer at uneven distributions in general. But Schmidt and Sommerville were clever,
and had another study where they had the same
distributions but no people. And here there was no difference. Suggesting that they weren't responding to
distributions per say. It's not that they looked [INAUDIBLE]
longer at three one versus two two But rather they look
longer. They're surprised by unfair distributions
more so than fair distributions.

And we'll return to many of these issues
when we talk about economic gains, and the developing notions of fairness
both within western society and also even other
societies. I think in general, the baby work, the
findings, the early morality or early proto-morality, or hence the morality in
babies is, is quite interesting and quite
promising. But there are limits to this work.
There are limits to what we know. There are open questions, and they're a
problem that we don't quite know yet how to solve. And this is what I want to devote the next short and final lecture for this week
about. [MUSIC]
