So, we've talked, about human variation
and moralitly, ways in which moral systems are different, and
then we talked about unviersals, the ways in which
they're alike, certain things about moralitly, aspects of
moralilyt that everyone shares. We discussed how this could possible be grounded, in evolution, we've talked
about, the moral lives of primates, non-human primates, we've talked about the moral
lives of, of babies, is there stuff we know
anything about it.

What I want to do in this, short lecture. Is list four things that we haven't talked
about in this context and, that are actually
kind of mysterious. And some of these mysteries, I think,
we're going to try to address and try to solve in, in
lectures that follow. Others, we're just going to be kind of
leave them as mysteries.

So, one is the ethics of divinity. This is a term by Schweder, anthropologist Schweder this is purity and
other matters. I began with the issues of the morality of
sex and death, food. About being pure and being impure. Certainly the morality of sex is, is, is,
is many, what many people think morality is
And it's a really fundamental part of our moral
systems, and you don't find any hint of this, this
moral code in babies. I don't think you find any hint of it in
non-human primates. Moreover, the mechanisms we used to, to
explain evolution of morality, kin selection, or reciprocal altruism
Don't seem to do well at explaining, why would we care so much and
how we bury the data, which foods we eat or or how we
have sex. Now this is something which I think is really interesting and we'll, we'll
return to that later, but I want to sort of say we haven't really
explained much of it now. To an extent they're universals. They're mysterious universals. The second category of things we don't
know about is actually a very specific evolutionary problem and
this involves third party sentiments, third
party judgements. What I mean by that is not judging that if you hit me you're bad, that's a first
party, second party sort of thing, but rather if
I see one person hitting another person
something bad has gone on. Now, I hope I've shown in the baby
studies, that babies are sensitive. Babies approve of the good guy who
disapprove of the bad guy. Babies want to reward the good guy and
punish the bad guy. So babies seem to be, we seem to be reasoning about the interactions of
third parties from the get go. What's harder to explain, or at least what we haven't explained yet, is how could
morality evolve? How do we care? Why would I want to punish somebody who's
done something bad to somebody else? Where's the evolutionary advantage in
that? Where's the evolutionary benefit? And I believe that is an open question to
be pursued later. The third open question is extending
morality to strangers. So, we, we've, the kin selection,
reciprocal altruism, are wonderful evolutionary theories
explaining why we care about our kin and why we care about those we are in continued reciprocal
interaction with. But as we talked about last week, morality
at least for us, at least for you and me, extends
broader than that. We care about people we've never met.
We care about people we haven't seen before. We care about people who who can do
nothing for us. Who, for whom, our help to them could
never be reciprocated. Yet, still morality extends more broadly. And that is a mystery. It is a mystery from evolutionary point of
view. It's also, to some extent, a mystery from
a developmental point of view. So, we talked about the kind responses and
kind actions of babies and toddlers. But, their kind responses and kind actions
goes in the immediate vicinity. We've talked about experimental research
on altruism towards others but in all of these situations these are altruisms to
those who are immediately present. And actually in these studies altruisms to
those that the baby or tottaler had some prior
interaction with. We are not [UNKNOWN] strangers. And how we become nice to strangers what happens? Is something which is going to occupy us,
later on in this course. And the fourth and final issue is we
haven't discussed moral systems at all. So maybe for a baby, maybe to some extent
for a chimpanzee. What morality is, is a set of, a capacity
for judgments and instincts and responses But for us,
it's more than that. We have systems of laws.
We have notions of justice. We have notions of procedures. We have, we create elaborate moral
systems. And underlying our creation of these moral
systems is a notion that you could have a morality that is
objective and impartial. We, we, every society creates laws that
are meant to apply to varying degrees to
everybody. Every moral system that gets to be called
a moral system, has some sort of notion, some sort of appreciation of that, what,
what should apply to me.
Should apply to you if you were in my shoes.
It called the golden rule in religion. Call it the, the, the contium principle
that moral should be universal. Or the principle of the utilitarians that
we have to add up pleasure and add up paid and it doesn't
matter who it comes from. In these religious systems of morality, or these philosophical, these secular systems
of morality. They seem to be A. Critically Important, but B. Way above of what we see from an evolutionary perspective and from a
developmentally comparative perspective. They seem to be uniquely human They seem
to be very very important. And they seem to be very difficult to
explain. Though we will try.
And I'll see you next week.
