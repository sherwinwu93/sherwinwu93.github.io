So I want to turn now and talk about
morality from a evolutionary perspective. Now I'd like to assume some familiarity
with the theory of natural selection. And if people want to get more of a background, as part of the supplementary
readings I linked to an excellent video that outlines the
logic and, and, and some examples of how natural
selection works. If you're not familiar with the evolutionary theory behind it, it's
absolutely fascinating and you should delve into it. I would actually also recommend reading
Origin of Species. Actually the first edition, Darwin's first
edition. Darwin was among so many other things, a
lovely writer. And he wrote for a broad audience. And this is an accessible and interesting
book. If you want something more contemporary, I
would suggest Richard Dawkins's wonderful book,
The Blind Watchmaker. I think this is the British cover. I read this when I was much younger and it
actually totally entranced me. And largely transformed my intellectual
life, getting me to take very seriously evolution and evolutionary theory, later
on influencing my own work as a psychologist.

It just, it's just a, a wonderful read. But in case, in case, you don't have the
background.
A very short summary of the theory which
has a sort of surprising simplicity and surprising elegance goes like this.
It involves three parts. There are three three conditions that are needed for natural selection to take
place. You have to have variation.
You have to have differential reproduction, meaning that some of the
variants do better at reproducing than others.
And you have to have heredity, where the offspring resemble their parents. And Darwin's extraordinary insight is, you
take these three simple facts when they occur. Variation, differential reproduction and
heredity. And under those conditions such things can
give rise to the most complicated and extraordinary
systems in the universe. It could give rise to biological life. It could give rise to animals, and parts
of animals and organs and all sorts of good things like that.

So, a very simple example, a sort of toy
example, would be like this, which is, you could say you could ask
yourself, Why is it that all? Imagine, it turns out to be the case, that
the beetles are brown, and, and birds don't
eat brown beetles. They can't see them, or whatever. Say, wow, how did that work out?
How did that happen? Well, one argument would be, one, one explanation is that maybe beetles
started off both green and brown, so you get this variation, some are
green, some are brown. But, there is differential reproduction,
there is differential reproduction because birds
eat the green beetles. And so the green beetles leave behind
fewer offspring than the brown beetles. Now there is also, as a third component,
heredity. So the brown beetles give rise to
offspring that tend to be brown. They resemble their parents. If you iterate this over and over again,
and this is actually simple example, you're not going to need a
computer model to, you to see it. Pretty soon all the beetles going to be
brown. Pretty soon in a condition where there's
variant x and variant y, and x does better than y,
leaves more offspring. Pretty soon, x will win and the whole
population will be, will be x. And this is a screamingly simple example,
but, you know, the project, so much of the project of evolutionary
biology is wrapping this up.

So forget now about a single color
difference and think about camouflage. And and, and the same evolutionary
explanation can explain why animals, why some animals are
so extraordinarily good at blending into
their environments. They're good at blending into their
environments because, variants, you go back into the
past. Variants that were better off at blending
in got eaten less by predators. And then, and so on and so forth and so
on, until through, you gradually converge on animals
that are almost invisible, because they got to be invisible because those
invisible variants, those variants that perfectly blended in
reproduced the most. And then you get to, to, to sort of detailed analyses of how this sort of
increasing, step by step by step, each step leading to
some, perhaps a minuscule, but a real advantage
in reproductive success. Leads to a, a, a new stage of development. And then so they're biological theories
well grounded in data on how the eye could evolve. How the how the leg of a horse could
evolve. How whole animals could evolve, how the
spine could evolve. And and so this is all the biological
part.

But it slides into psychology because one
of the, the, the organs that have evolved, that
has evolved through natural selection is of course,
the brain and in particular, organ we are most interested is the human
brai, human brain. And if you see the human brain as a biological adaptation, as something which
has risen through natural selection. That's just quite a new way of looking at
things. And this was something Darwin himself was
sensitive to. So one point he writes, that as a result of evolutionary theory, psychology will be based on a new
foundation. That of the necessary acquirement via
evolution of each mental power and capacity by
gradation. That is, you look at the cluster of mental
capacities we have and each one we can see as an adaptation that has sort of gradually developed through
increased reproductive success.

Now this is a certain view of the mind.
It doesn't say the mind is a huge all purpose computer or the mind is a general associative network as many
philosophers would argue. And some modern day computational
theorists would argue. But rather, the mind is a cluster of
different capacities. Each one has evolved for a different
purpose. Also, they've evolved to work in concert
with one another. This is, again, an old idea. The most one of the most famous psychologists of all, William
James, expressed it quite nicely. William James wrote. It is often said that man is distinguished
from the lower animals by having a much smaller assortment of native
instincts and impulses than they, but this is a great mistake. James's point is it's very tempting just
to say, oh, animals are the product of biological
evolution. There's a bunch of instincts that they possess that guide them to, to various
behaviors.

But humans are special. Humans, we don't have instincts anymore,
we're just very smart. We're cultural creatures, say. And to some extent we are very smart and
to some extent we are cultural creatures. But the approach that Darwin and James
recommend, an approach which is pursued by many
evolutionary psychologists. An approach which, you know, guides my own research is
that in addition to any general smartness any
cultural proclivities that we posses, we also have an assortment
of, of instincts, call them mental organs,
call them modules. For language, for mate selection, for rudiment, rudimentary mathematics, for
social interaction. These may be in different parts of the
brain. They may be re, re. They are clearly related to one another
and they each have their own evolutionary history shaped
by natural selection. I'll also point out, everybody uses that
picture of William James. And so you might get the impression he was
born that way. But here's a picture of him slightly
younger. And as you can see, he was quite the guy.

Okay. So, you, you, you think of the human brain
now as a product of natural selection as a set of
instincts or organs. And, and, and, and it's easy enough to
explain, to see how this approach can explain certain
appetites, like food and sex. So why do we get hungry. Well, you get hungry because it motivates
us to eat, and any ancestors we had that was that weren't motivated to eat would
die and wouldn't reproduce, this is why
animals get hungry. Why do we eat this and not that? Well that gets a little bit more
interesting. We can kind learn about the details of our
appetites. Details of what we like to eat and what we
like to drink by looking at evolutionary benefits that,
that exist when we eat this and not that. What turns us on?
What about sex? Well, same thing. Any animal that wasn't actively involved in the project of reproduction, wouldn't
reproduce.

And it for the most part for the most there's a lot of competition for
reproductive resources. Either getting to reproduce at all, or
getting to reproduce with the best possible mate to get the
best possible genes. And so, and this is not the topic of this course but it would be a great other
course. So any serious inquiry into the psychology
of human sexuality will be guided, at least in part, by a
clear headed look at how evolution would have
shaped us sexually. How it would have shaped our desires, our
strategies, and our behaviors.

But, you might worry, and through history
a lot of people have worried, that this evolutionary approach is perfectly
good when it comes to sort of so-called selfish
desires. You know eating, and having sex, and
protecting yourself and so on. But morality isn't about the self
primarily. Morality is about the welfare of others. And how could a evolutionary process
driven by survival and reproduction lead to caring about the
welfare of others?

So some people say about, about animals
that according to natural selection, according to evolutionary theory, we're survival
machines. And it's hard to think of anything more amoral than that. Or well, okay, how about survival of the
fittest? Which is, which is you know, a sort of
savage, amoral, perhaps immoral doctrine. Nature red in tooth and claw. An idea here is that if you think about
human nature from a, you know, a clear headed, cold-blooded biological,
natural selection point of view, there's no place for morality.

So to the extent that we are moral
creatures, to the extent we can do right and wrong, we can think about right and wrong, that has to be separate from
morality. Maybe it was instilled within us by God. Maybe, it was a cultural invention that we
came up with with our powerful intelligence, but
it cannot be natural.

Now, I don't think these worries are
entirely mistaken. I think certain claims about our moral
nature, certain idealistic views about what
morality could be. As part of us, are really precluded by the
facts of biological evolution. So, imagine genes that gave rise to an
indiscriminate altruist. So I'll describe my terms. I'll define my terms. Altruism is the act of giving to somebody
at a cost to yourself. An indiscriminate altruist is someone who gives to everybody.
Doesn't care, just gives to anybody. How would this indiscriminate altruist do? Well, if there's a community of
indiscriminate altruists, we all just give indiscriminately to everybody else,
we could do pretty well actually. There's all sorts of things in life where you could use somebody's help watching
over a child. Moving something that's heavy, collecting
food. And if everybody helps everybody else,
it's really to the sort of mutual benefit of the whole
society.

But here's the problem. Imagine such a society of indiscriminate
altruists and now imagine a mutant. Imagine another creature pops in who
receives but never gives. So, takes any food anybody gives to it you want to watch your kids that's fine, but
itself is not implying to, to do anything to help
other people. To help other members of its species. It's not hard to see that this mutant
would have a huge advantage. Suppose every time, suppose take a, take a
concrete example warning cries. So some animals give warning cries when a
predator approaches, so a predator's in the distance, I see it and I
scream warning, warning. I don't scream warning warning, I scream some sort, I
can't, I can't imitate a warning cry that any
animal would do. A human warning cry. Hey, warning.
Suppose I'm an indiscriminate altruist. So I just do this no matter what, whoever
is around me. Now, imagine this mutant. And everybody benefits from me. Even though when I shout out the warning
cry, it raises my own risk because it calls my attention
to the predator. So, the benefit to everybody is great, but
there's some risks, risks to myself. And, if everybody was like me, the trade
off would work out well. But now again, a mutant comes in, who gets
all the benefit. He listens to warning cries and runs away. But, when he sees a predator, he just runs
away. Doesn't do a warning cry at all.
He would do better. He would live longer. He would reproduce more.
Which means is nice guys finish last. Pure kindness of an indiscriminate sort
can't evolve.

Okay but now we get a little bit more
subtle. What about genes that give rise to a
discriminate altruist? A discriminate altruist is somebody who,
who acts in a way to help others, and takes cost to help
others. But is discriminating, helps some but not
everybody. Well we actually know that discriminate
altruists. exist. We know animals are discriminate
altruists. Take the simplest case of caring for your
children. So animals, mammals, for instance, take
care of their offspring. Sometimes female mammals will feed their
offspring from their own bodies. Mammals will watch over them, will take care of them, will,
will, provide them with food once they're born, before
they're born and so on. And this is, they don't do this to
everybody. They do this to, to their offspring.

So you know, one example is as everyone uses cute animals but one example is
vampire bats. So vampire bats, when a vampire bat will
fly out of its cave, find a horse or something, bite
the horse get in a lot of blood.
More blood then itself needs. Fly back to the cave and then regurgitate
this blood into the mouths of its baby vampire
bats. And, and you could see this sort of
altruism being beneficial and, and it's a kindness, but it's not the sort
of pure, indiscriminate kindness.

One way to think about this, the term
people use to describe the phenomenon that I've been introducing is kin
selection. And the idea is this, you have a specific
gene for something, what's going to make that
gene a winner? What's going to make the gene such that
it's going to spread through a population. And before you know it everyone's going to
have the gene. Well one answer is, it might increase the
chance that the bearer of that gene will survive
and reproduce. If there is a gene that makes me resistant
to a disease like malaria, and my next door neighbor does not have that
gene I will do better. I will reproduce more. My neighbor will reproduce less. And over the fullness of time everybody
will have this gene because this gene just leads to
an advantage. But a gene could also spread if it
increases the chance that other individuals who possess that gene, genetic relatives, will survive and
reproduce. So. Imagine gene A makes animals care for its
siblings and gene B makes animals only care for
itself. Since if you only care for your siblings,
your gene A your siblings also have some chance of
having gene A in them. And so by active sort of caring for your
kin, genes get to replicate themselves.

And so the, the logic of this was, was presented in a somewhat comical way by the
biologist Haldane. Haldane was asked presumably, it's one of
these stories that, that sounds apocryphal but may well have been true. He was asked in a bar, just casual
conversation, would you lay down your life for your
brother? Made a few quick calculations and
responded, no, but I would gladly give my life for three brothers or five nephews or
nine first cousins. Now what he was doing in a whimsical way,
we never do this consciously, was making reference to to the degree of
genetic relatedness. So as you can see in this chart over here different relatives are related to
you to different degrees. And related to you in this sense means
what are the odds that for any gene you possess that they
also possess that gene. So with me and my identical twin. If I were to have an identical twin, it'd
go up to about 100%. For me and my sibling, about 50%, and so on.
So we could unpack Haldane's answer. Would you lay down your life for your
brother who has 50% of your genes? No. But, I would give my life for three
brothers, because that's 150%. Or five nephews, 125%, or nine first
cousins, 112.5%. Nobody actually, again, nobody does these
calculations in their heads but the idea is that the logic here, the fact that
these strategies. Lead the strategies of, of a certain form
of discriminate altruism towards close genetically related
kin, lead to greater success of genes has shaped our psychologies and
it's this psy, these shape psychologies that leads to,
sort of, moral sentiments. Towards people close to us.

This is if you defended, at great length
again by Richard Dawkins in his wonderful book,
The Selfish Gene. And The Selfish Gene is one of these books
that people always misunderstand. And, and the people who misunderstand are
often the people who simply look at the cover. And, and, and, and, and misread things. So often, they say, oh, Dawkins is saying
people are selfish. But actually, Dawkins is actually saying
exactly the opposite. He's saying genes are selfish, in the
metaphorical sense, he's very clear it's a metaphor,
that all they want to do, metaphor again, is make copies of themselves, replicate
themselves, spread through the population. But, because genes are selfish people
aren't selfish. That is to the extent that evolution
operates at the level of the genes there's no hard and fast
distinction between oneself and another. Before you think of things in terms of
genes you might think you're one individual with
its own interests. And everybody else is their own individual
with their own interests. But from the genetic point of view,
there's no sharp line. Your interests are, are the same, genetically, as two of your brothers'
interests. Genes cross-cut things in different ways,
and a genetic perspective on human nature, interestingly
enough can provide our first understanding of where
morality can come from. [MUSIC]
