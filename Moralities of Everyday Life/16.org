Back to moralities of everyday life. Today as you know is a guest lecture and
I'll talk a bit about that, but I want to go through some introductory stuff first,uh, some
procedural issues. First, very important, there should be no
food or drink out. If you have food or drink with you, please put it away, and definitely take it with
you. We're here as a, as guests of the law
school, and we wanted very much to be good guests so that they'll invite us
back. because otherwise we'll have no place to
go. so, please no food and drink. As always, particularly if you're in a
member of the community and this is your first time here, please email me for
access to that. Next class we're back at Battell Chapel.
The essay assignment is posted. Please look it over carefully and contact your teaching fellow if you have any
questions. The first exam is in two weeks. So next week is a class up at Battell
Chapel, then we have an exam. I do not know where the exam will, we do not have either law school or Battell
Chapel. There are negotiations for where the exam
will be. You will know as soon as I know. The exam is based on the six, including
this one, and one next week. And the 20 plus articles and talks that
we've covered. I'll give a little bit more detail about
the sort of questions we'll ask in the exam
next class. If you can't find seats at the bottom, there's seats remaining on the balcony up
there. Finally, as somebody asked me how to best
prepare for the exam and one suggestion which came up, which I always get from my
large classes, is to form study groups. It's an extremely useful way to prepare
for an exam, to get a bunch of people together for two, or three, or four times where you go over the materials with one
another. So what I would suggest is that, when this
class comes to an end, you might want to talk to the person
next to you about forming a group, or the best way, everybody taking
this course for credit, is in a section, and
could then meet with other students and their friends
into section and set up a time to meet to discuss the
course. These are the readings for next week.
They're now posted on the class's server. The reading response is due noon, October
11th. The reading response must discuss some of
the readings. The reading response is this, and this is
a quote from Parker, who you're going to read for
next week. At one point Ian Parker summarizes the
views of social psychologists with this: People
tend to do things because of where they are, not who they are. In other words, we do things because of the situations we find ourselves in, not
because of our character If your last name goes
from A to LES, explain why he's right. If your last name is from LET to Z,
explain why he's wrong. I'm not going to stop here for questions
about procedural issues. But if you have any questions, either ask your teaching fellow, or ask me
immediately after class. I'm very pleased to introduce, Laurie
Santos as our guest lecturer for today. I, I, I have just one guest lecturer for
this semester and, and I really wanted it to be
Laurie. If a prof, professors at a university like
Yale tend to specialize. If you're lucky, you're good at one thing. You could be a gifted administrator, good
at dealing with people. You could be a great teacher of undergraduates. You could be a great teacher of graduate
students. Most of all, you could be a great
researcher. It's very rare to find somebody who could
do all of those. And I think that, that, that, that Laurie
exemplifies this very rare case. She is a fabled graduate advisor. She runs a large undergraduate lab where
undergraduates work with her on projects having to do with primate
cognition both here and, and in other places.
She teaches an extremely popular undergraduate course with the forbidding
name title Sex Evolution in Human Nature. Designed to scare away undergraduates with
the word sex. >> [LAUGH]
>> And most of all she is an extraordinary researcher.
She does work With lemurs in in Florida, with rhesus macaques in Cayo
Santiago, with capuchins here at Yale. And as well, she also studies human adults
and human children and human babies. She has this incredibly rich, incredibly
vibrant and interesting research program, of which you'll get some flavor
of here today. I'll just add that, that to some extent,
she's, she's the founder of, of an intellectual field, that
of comparative behavioral economics. I'll, I'll end by pointing out, she also has a considerable profile as a public
intellectual. Those of you who have friends who couldn't
make it here, I would, and, and, and after you hear her
lecture, you could encourage your friends to go on to the TED
site and see, get a snippet of what's, of what her
work is like. So I really want to welcome her, and I
want us to all welcome her. I'm looking forward to her lecture.

>> [SOUND] [SOUND] [BLANK_AUDIO] Not without all that fanfare just to get
me a little bit nervous, but thanks for having me today, it's
going to be fun to tell you guys a little bit more about this perspective
on morality that takes into account the fact that we're not the organisms out
there that might have moral concerns. But rather than start with animal moral
concerns, I thought I'd start with a little bit of a
historical perspective today.

So imagine if you will with me, you are a resident of New Haven, but not a
member of the modern day. Somebody who lived back, back in the days,
so back about 350 years ago in a New Haven colony, back
in the 1600s. Now, you'd find New Haven looking a lot
like you expected to look today back when there were still
the nine squares. There was still the New Haven Green that
you could go visit and so on. But, you might find a few things that,
from our modern perspective, seem a little bit
out of place. So, imagine that on this fateful day, you happen to be
walking along the Greens with friends of yours, maybe off to grab
lunch and so on. You might have been surprised to see what
was happening on the New Haven Green that day because
the New Haven colony was actually taking part in a
public execution of a few criminals who were actually on
trial that day. So, you know, not just people playing
frisbee, there are actually gallows out there, people
being put to death. And on this particular fateful day it was especially exciting because it just wasn't
one bad individual who was being put to death, they were
actually putting to death nine diabolical conspirators who the report said had
committed a wretched crime against God and man. So this sounds really bad. What did these folks do? Well, you get a bit of a sense of what these folks did by looking at the
individuals who were accused. So if you look to the records of what happened this day you see this list
involved. This one guy who's enlabeled here as
Mister. Potter. We're told that he's 50 years of age.
Less information, though, about the other eight conspirators
who were involved. They're just listed as a cow, two heifers,
three sheep, and two sows. You might be thinking, what on earth crime did the set of nine conspirators commit,
and then you look to the crime that's listed and
you say oh, yep, makes a little bit of sense. But these are individuals who put on crime
for the damnable crime of bestiality.

Now, if you're like me with my modern
eyes, you might be looking at this sort of crime and all the conspirators who are put
to death. And you might look at the list and think
you know, I bet of the nine conspirators there's sort of one mastermind of the whole bestiality
thing. [LAUGH] Another set of individuals that
went along for the ride, but you would in fact be wrong
according to the records, because if you look at the
records, they're very detailed about the lives of these
individuals that were involved. And of Mr. Potter, they say the following
things: he was a good dude, he was devout in worship,
gifted in prayer, he was zealous in reforming the sins of other people,
apparently not of other animals, but he was, you know, a
totally honorable guy. It was the other eight conspirators who
folks thought, that were an issue here. They, it is said, were of, they were unclean devils, and they were in fact
diabolically possessed. So diabolically possessed it's thought
that they used their, their demonic possession to sort of
convince, and seduce and tempt this otherwise innocent
guy who had to be put to the gallows because he went along with this damnable crime.

And so, this strikes our modern eyes as
very, very funny. But it shouldn't, in part because you
think this is some sort of rare event that I pulled out of the terrible
annals of weird New Haven history. In fact, fact of the matter is, back in
the 1600s, pre-Enlightenment, there were lots of odd cases of animals
being put on trial. Put to death and so on. So this wasn't an unusual thing back 300
years ago. But it strikes us as really unusual. And so today, we want to contemplate why. What changed that made this feel really
weird?

Well, I want to submit that it's, it's not
the reason you might suspect. It's not because animals have all of a sudden become much more angelic, and less
tempting, right? You know, they're, if you have a dog or
cat at home, you know they're just as diabolical, perhaps,
as, you know, animals 300 years ago. I also want to submit that it's not the
other reason that you might think. Which is that we've become a little bit less barbaric in our ways of capital
punishment. Because, as many of you know, in fact, at
least in this country, this is not something that
we've become less barbaric about. In fact, one of the current moralities of
everyday life that I think folks struggle with is what to do with this and
whether this is morally appropriate. And just as a sort of editor's note aside,
if you're an undergraduate who cares about
these issues, you might want to talk to the Yale democrats who are
petitioning Connecticut to get rid of their death penalty which is still
on the books. But, that's just my my little aside.

Getting back to the real matter at hand,
what was it that changed that makes capital punishment of animals
on the New Haven Green seem weird? Well, what I want to submit is that one of
the things at least that's changed is that we seem to have a slightly different post enlightenment view of the moral
status of animals. And, I want to submit that the view that
we have is, in some ways, a little bit worse then what
we had before. Because, the view that we have now is
incredibly conflicted. At times we seem quite confused about what we think the moral status of
animals really actually is. And when I speak about the moral status of animals, I'm actually not talking about
one status that you might be thinking of,
which is animals in the status of moral
patients. Organisms to whom we might want to decide
whether to give moral concerns. This is of course, a controversial and
very conflicted issue for us, we can debate
about whether it's okay and permissible to use
animals as food, as experimental subjects, and so
on, but that's not the confusing issue I'm
going to deal with. The confusing issue I am going to try to
deal with is our perception of animals as moral
agents, individuals not necessarily who can be
punished or so on, but individuals like us who might have
moral concerns. In particular who might have psychological maybe neuromechanisms to actually deal
with questions of whether something is
appropriate or good or permissible or punishable.

And these are the kinds of concerns I'm going to ask about today,
and the view that I'm going to develop is that we
seem to today have a somewhat conflicted view
about what we think animal's moral concerns are, if
they have any. And I'll start with this confusion by sort
of turning to Charles Darwin, who was one of the first to sort of think
about this issue, this idea of whether animals have moral concerns, and
what they might look like, because he and his first writings on this sort of bears the hallmarks of some of these
contradictions. So he starts his treatise on this in The Decent of Man, by
knowing that you have all the differences between man
and the lower animals. The moral sense is by far the most
important. I mean, Darwin was quick to submit that we
are the only species who are doing, the kinds of things
we're all doing right now. Right? Sitting in a school of law, that's trying
to figure out, what the different moral concerns of
society should be. Right? Hanging out in a classroom where we're talking about ethics and moral
considerations. We are alone in the animal kingdom in doing these kinds of things.
And Darwin, of course, recognized that. But as Darwin would go on to say, it seems
like if you look carefully, you might expect,
you know, any old animal that had these well-marked social
instincts, if you're a social creature, you might inevitably acquire something
like a moral sense, or a conscience. And here's the rub. We seem to think, of course, we're very
different from other animals. But based on the fact that natural
selection works in the same way in us as it does in other species, you might expect
other species with social concerns to develop relatively
similar moral senses. And the question, I think, gets even worse
when you start looking at the natural behavior of animals, because what we see
when we look to other animals are all these examples where it looks like the animals
are paying attention to things that seem like
moral concerns, where they're worried about
other individuals getting harmed, helping other individuals, perhaps
enforcing social norms. It really raises this question of do other animals have
moral concerns, are they a lot like our own and in particular
for purposes of this class, what can we actually learn
about the human moral sense from terming to the moral
senses of other animals? And those are the kind of things I want to
sort of submit to you today, and I'm going to try to do this
in two different parts. First, I'm going to ask the question of
whether or not non human animals share some of the kinds of moral concerns that
you might think, are pretty hallmarks of our, our own species, and I'm going to
focus specifically on some of the moral concerns you guys talked
about a few weeks ago. These are ones that people like Jonathan
Haidt and others have submitted that there might be some universal aspects
of the human moral sphere. And I'm going to focus on a couple
different domains. Suffering and harm, domains of hierarchy
and authority, and also this question of reciprocity and
fairness. And what we're going to see is in all of these cases, we're going to see
hallmarks of human-like moral concerns in non-human animals and
also some important differences. And so that's going to be the bulk of the
talk today but then I thought I would end with a sort of special section
or a part two, where we really zoom in on the evolutionary tree and try to take a
pick, a peek specifically at our closest living relatives and try to see what, what their moral lives actually say about our
own moralities. And one of the things that we're going to
see is that when we take that peek and sort of zoom in on
our branch of closest related primates, we see some
hints that the kinds of immoral actions humans are capable of, seem to be different than
the rest of the animal kingdom, but similar to some of the immoral acts of other closely related
species. And for that we'll turn to this issue of
chimpanzee violence, and sort of what our own chimp legacy says
about ourselves. And finally if we have time we'll have
some big sweeping conclusions, I'm sure we'll solve all the problems of human
morality from this approach, you know, and so on. But, First, before jumping to that we're
going to sort of start with these universal moral
constraints.And I thought I'd start here with this idea of whether a
non-human animals share concerns about issues related to the
suffering and harm. And the reason for this is I think here's
a spot where you might think that nature wouldn't build creatures that care
about morality in the same way that we do, right? We have these lay notions of nature that in fact, nature's not at all concerned
with suffering and harm. In fact, it kind of promotes it. Nature is sort of read in tooth and claw. We expect to kind of look out at the animal kingdom and see, you know,
individuals going for the jugular, you know, sort of Chuck Norris-style, all over different taxa that
we look at. But the fact of the matter is is that when
you really look at the natural behavior of animals,
you find strikingly little of this. Of course, you know, animals do eat each
other, and they do eat other animals for food and so on, but so do we. If you actually look at how individuals
interact within their own species with other con specifics, you find
remarkably little aggression and violence. Or in cases where you do see it, it's
rather checked. So it, turning to the kinds of species I
wanted to talk about today consider the examples where you might expect to see the most kind of jugular, Chuck Norris style
stuff. These are critters out there that have,
have weapons that are built, seemingly
specifically for the purpose of doing these kinds of aggressive
acts. I've just picked, you know, out of a set
of animals I could have chosen, these bull
elk here, these guys, as you can see, have incredibly impressive
weapons that natural selection devotes lots of effort to making sharp and
scary and big. But if you look at how often bull elk
actually, you know, literally rip each other to shreds with these weapons, what
you find is that it's actually not very much. Instead if you look at their natural
behavior you see a number of different behaviors
that are aimed at showing restraint when using
these kinds of weapons. So this, incident that you are seeing here
is actually an escalation of about, a couple
of different steps. Normally bull elk wouldn't even ever face
each other with their weapons so poised to actually
hurt each other. First, they do very sensitive things like
assess each others' size by walking in parallel with
each other. Then, they actually assess each others' strength through the use of vocalizations. Only if that doesn't work, do they
escalate to actually measuring sort of antlers versus antlers
who's of the right size. And it's only in very rare cases that
those sort of attempt don't work, that they actually
get to fighting. But even then you don't see them using
these impressive weapons in the way that you might expect, through
lethal levels of aggression. When natural selection builds in weapons,
it often also builds in restraint in which to deal with
them. This raises the question about, you know, is this just a funny feature of animal weaponry, or is
it the case that animals really are trying to
prevent unnecessary harm, perhaps even trying to
help each other. And that's where we're going to go with this sort of question about suffering and
harm. We're going to explore whether non-human
animals actually care about the suffering of
others. Do they feel pain when others feel pain? Do they actually feel a motivation to help
others? And you've seen some of the stuff in the domain of sort of feeling the pain of
others in the readings that you've done this
week. Frans De Waal I think does a really good job of articulating these anecdotal cases
in which you see animals doing things to each other
that suggests they don't like it when a con-specific is
feeling pain.

So this is a case of, in chimpanzees, when
you see individuals like this little guy here actually reaching out and trying
to caress individuals who were involved in a
fight. You see all kinds of post conflict behavior like this suggesting, at least
anecdotally, animals don't like to see others in pain
and will act to sort of remedy that. But is there any experimental evidence of
something like this? Can you actually see this if you put
animals into an experimental situation that will do
things to help others.

Well there's not much recent work on this
topic, but there actually was a lot of early work
on this back in the 1960's, I think when the
ethics of doing studies with animals were a
little bit different. But Rice and Gainer did a first study on this, actually looking at whether rats
would be willing to help other rats. And the way they did this was to first train a novel rat on this sort of, weird
contraption. The rat learns that every time he presses
this he's actually able to lower this sort of rig up there, this sort of rope
with a block hanging onto it. And the rat learned that actually at
different times the lever would be differentially
hard to do. So sometimes it was hard to do it.
Sometimes it was easy. All this was, this was the prelude to the
experiment in question, which was to ask if the rat
would be more motivated to push the lever if it wasn't a block. But a very helpless little rat, sort of,
you know, squeak, squeak, help, you know. But this is a question, this, you know,
rat may or may not know this other rat in
question. Is it motivated to work extra hard to
actually help this other rat out? And what Rice and Gainer found was that,
in fact, rats would do this. They worked much harder than when it was
not a, another rat that was sort of harnessed up
by this rig. And they actually seemed to need an actual
other rat who was there squealing in pain. If you give them a situation which they
can press a lever just to shut off an auditory version of a
bunch of rat screams. Just the auditory information they were
getting. What you find is that rat's won't normal
do that. But seeing an actual other rat in distress
caused them to take action. Question is what is the rat representing?
How are they doing this? You don't know the answer to these kinds
of questions. But you do see the same kinds of helping behavior to relieve stress in a bunch of
other species.

Masserman and colleagues did this with a
famous set of experiments with rhesus monkeys,
something very similar. They actually allowed rhesus monkeys to
earn the food that they would get during the day by pulling a
lever like this one. So a rhesus monkey learns every time he
pulls this chain he gets food. But then again on the fateful day of the
study the monkey comes in and realizes hey
there's a conspecific there. I wonder what happens when I pull the
lever. Turns out when he pulled the lever he also
got food just as before, but this time every
time he pulled the lever he would also shock the
other monkey with a series of pretty awful
electric shocks. A sort of Peter Gabriel, you know, sort of Shock the Monkey, you know, back in the
1960s. You guys don't know 80s music. It's okay. But anyway, the question is, what does
this poor monkey do? He's getting his food from the act of
pulling this lever. That's how he get's his food. Will he refrain, knowing that it's
actually hurting a con-specific? And the answer trialed out to be, yes. What you find is that most of the monkeys
that Masserman tested actually would refrain from pulling
the chain that shocked another individual. And in some cases these researchers found
that monkeys would forgo getting food for up to about 12 days, which is the point
where they stopped the study. Just so long as they could avoid hurting
another monkey in the study. And the problem with this work is that
because it was done back in the day, I think we have little understanding of
what was really going on in these monkey's
minds. You know, what were they trying to
achieve? Did they just not like the stimulus? Did they really empathetically feel for
this other money who was being shocked? .

But I think that it is important to point
out how impressive this behavior is when you compare it with the kind of
thing that humans would do in similar studies because as many of you
who have taken Intro Pysch know, this exactly the kind of experiment that Milgrim and is colleagues did with human
participants. And if there is a scary authority figure
there, human participants are happy to shock another
con-specific, sometimes to the point of giving pretend fatal shocks. So, especially impressive when you look at
what other humans are doing. Now how about the question whether other animals are motivated to help other
individuals. And here you've already seen that there
are ways that we can ask non-verbal creatures whether
they're willing to do this.

The work of Felix Warneken that I think
you've seen before has shown that very young human children
are willing to do this. It turns out non human animals,
particularly chimpanzees, are also willing to do this. [SOUND] Warneken also did a study where a
human was trying to do something, namely scrub this block for
some reason, and lost her sponge. And what you see is that chimpanzees are actually quite willing to help the human
there.

This is helping humans, how about helping
other chimpanzees? Well, Warneken also did a set of studies
where chimps could help other chimps. This is the chimp who's in need. He's actually trying to get into this side
of the room because there's some food that he wants but the door is locked. And what Warneken found was that this other chimpanzee on this side will
actually work to open the lock so that the second
chimpanzee can get in and get the food. Incidentally, the chimpanzee who's helping
isn't getting any food here, he seems to be just doing this out of a motivation
to help others. So we seem like this helping behavior
seems to be shared as well. How about cases of real sorts of helping,
not just helping somebody achieve a goal but
really giving other individuals sustenance as we do in
the case of donating food. Well, this has been a long line of studies in primates with a little bit of mixed
results, but there's some species that seem to show
evidence of actually wanting to share and donate food
to other individuals.

And I'll tell you about one of the studies
in this regard by Frans De Waal and colleagues in
part because it involves as a co-author one of your TS for
the class, my grad student Kristie Leimgruber back in
her life, back with Frans. But what Christie's project tried to do is to ask, if you give
capuchin monkeys the choice to something pro-social or to do
something selfish, which do they do. And they gave capuchins the options to
pick one of two tokens to trade with a human
experimenter. One of the tokens was a selfish token. The capuchins learned that it meant that
they were going to get food, and nobody else was
going to get food. The second token though was a pro-social
token. And what the capuchins learned was that every time they picked this, they actually
get a piece of food themselves, but the same
piece of food they got, was given to another
individual. So it's certainly no skin off their back
to go either way. They get food just the same. Are they willing to help another
individual out? And when they're given the choice and
another individual's standing in there with them,
will they actually pick the pro-social token to hand back to
the experimenter or will they go for the
selfish one?

This is just sort of science report showing cute capuchins chewing on tokens
and stuff. But, here are the real data, right.
What I'm plotting here is how often the capuchin
picks the pro-social option so bigger bars equals
more pro-social behavior. And what you find is that strikingly
across a bunch of conditions when they're faced with their
group mates and their kin, capuchins are actually incredibly pro-social,
willing to give food to another individual, at least in cases where it's kind of no
skin off their back. There were two conditions though in which
the capuchins chose not to be pro-social. And I think those are interesting for what
they say about the limitations of the moral
sense in other animal. One of them is that capuchin monkeys did
not act pro-socially when the other recipient was an individual
that they didn't know. Somebody from a different group or a
different enclosure. In that case what the capuchins did was
just sort of choose at chance. They didn't necessarily give the good one. They didn't give the bad one.
They just kind of didn't care. So it seems like the donation circle for
the capuchins is relatively limited. Perhaps more-so than us, where we often
times give food to strangers, perhaps more so
than our own family in some cases. But there's a second case that I think is
even more striking, which is the case of when the other
individual is actually anonymous. In other words, you are playing in this
game, but the other individual with whom you're playing can't actually see you, and they don't actually know which choice
you're making. Here it's not that the capuchin monkeys were indifferent, they were actually
statistically antisocial, so you notice that that bar is actually
lower than you would expect by chance. This is capuchin monkeys strategically
being a jerk as soon as they're in a position where other
individuals don't know what they're doing. I think this suggests perhaps a striking
limitation of what you see, at least in human kinds of economic games
like you talked about last week, where people tend to be relatively pro-social in
dictator games, at least to the extent they think they're anonymous, and we could quibble about whether folks think think
that. But the upshot is that when we look at
this domain of suffering and harm we see some similarities and some important
differences between the human moral sense and that of other
animals. In the domain of feeling others' pains, we
do see that animals are sometimes motivated
to reduce others' pain.

You know, again, much more, much shocking
from the perspective of thinking about animals
as, sort of, being read in tooth and claw and so
on, they seem to care about others' pain. But we don't yet know empirically whether they're really feeling others' pain in the way, introspectively, it feels like I
might feel others' pain if I watched someone
suffering and being harmed in this way. In the domain of kind of being motivated
to help, we see lots of examples, at least within the
order of primates, that non-human primates are motivated to help
others, willing to do, to go out of their way to help another
individual achieve the goal. But it also seems like there are important
limitations on who they're going to do it for, not for
strangers. And when they're going to do it, perhaps
not in situations in which they're anonymous and they might not be able to
get some positive feedback for it. So that's the domain of suffering and
harm, and now I'll turn to the domain of hierarchy
and authority.

And here is a spot where our
lay-intuitions might suggest that we're actually going to
see some similarities. Because, as most of you know, human
society is very hierarchical and we have status and
so on. But the same is true for a number of
different animals species. You can look out at, across a bunch of
different tacks and see the sort of setup of the same kind of thing you see
in human corporations and societies. You know, there's the guy on top, who's
proverbially, you know, doing not as nice things to the guys on
the bottom. Can poop on the guys on the bottom. That's the, that's the joke. But the act of studying these kinds of things in animals is not actually very
new. Because it turns out that a lot of the organizational behavior work that
studies how hierarchies work in humans and how hierarchies
organizes themselves actually started through
studies on animal behavior.

And, in fact, they started with a set of
Norwegian scientists who had worked out how things like pecking
orders work in chickens. Those principles and dynamics worked out
for chickens were then directly applied to cases of
human hierarchies. So here's a spot where we might tend to
see some really close similarities. Problem is that we still don't know, even
though animals have these hierarchies. Do they moralize them in the same way that some cultures moralize human
hierarchies and human status? Do they think it's a moral violation to not respect a high-ranking member of their
group? And, and these are the things that are
tricky to actually get at. The kinds of questions about whether
animals care about status and dominance is a surreal
moralizing sense. And whether they respect authority in
these sort of moral terms. I think here's a spot where we don't have great answers in the domain of non- human
animals. Nobody's done the right experiments to
kind of get at this.

But I'll tell you some of the stuff we do
know. And what we do know suggests, again some
important similarities that we might not have expected between
humans and other animals. One of the things we do know is that
there's lots of evidence that animals seem to care
about status. But my favorite experiment on this is
asking the question whether animals really pay to get information about other
individuals who are of higher status. Now, we in our species do this all the time. You know, how often I've been at the
airport and bought a stupid magazine so I can
learn about the goings on of Will and Kate, you know, I don't like to admit in public
company. But the fact of the matter is we care
about high status individuals, we want information about
them and we're willing to pay for it.

And so Deaner and colleagues asked the
same question. They asked are rhesus monkeys willing to pay for information about high status
individuals? And here was the task they set up, so they gave rhesus monkeys the option to choose
one of two different targets that would give them juice. So the rhesus monkeys started by kind of
fixating here and then they get this choice between target
one and target two. And rhesus monkeys get to learn that when
they choose target one what would happen is that, after they make the choice they
get some amount of juice as a reward. All well and good. Question is what happens when they pick
target number two? And what they learn over time is that
picking target number two gives them some other amount of juice that
can vary over time. But they also get to see an image of another monkey. And the researchers varied whether the
image was of a high ranking individual, someone
of status, a kind of Will and Kate of the
monkey world or someone of low status. Someone that they, they couldn't care
about because they were under them in the
hierarchy. And what they were able to measure,
because they were changing amounts of juices, are there pictures that the
monkeys will pay in juice to see. In other words, they'll choose less juice
plus the picture over more juice. And there, there are other individuals that the monkeys would
have to be paid to see? In other words, they would only choose the
option with the picture if they got extra juice to see
those individuals.

So, that was sort of the set up and here
are the data. It's a little bit complicated but what
Deaner and colleagues are plotting here is this
normalized amount of juice. So bars that go down from the zero, means
the monkey has to be paid in juice to see those pictures,
so there's negative juice. And the bars that go up are actually the
ones that the monkeys were willing to pay in juice to see. In other words, they take less juice to
see those pictures. And what you can already see is a trend
where monkeys seem to care a lot about status,
so all these green bars on the left here are
cases where the monkeys had the option to see low
ranking faces. And what you can see is that the monkeys
had to be paid in juice to see some of these
faces. And, some cases a real large amount of
juice they had to take just to look at this
face. In contrast, in the cases of some of the
high status faces, the monkeys were actually
willing to pay a lot in juice to actually look at this. They're to willing to take a cost just to
see information. And just to put this cost in perspective,
I didn't tell you about one other image that these
researchers gave the monkeys. These are images of monkey perinea, which is a nice way of saying monkey
pornography. These are images of monkey reproductive
areas. And what you can see is, yes of course,
those are the ones the monkeys are willing to pay a lot
in juice for. [LAUGH] you know, they're no Different
than some humans. But look, if you look at high status
individuals, they're not all that different from this incredibly reproductively relevant stimulus for these
monkeys. So it seems like, seeing high ranking
faces is very, very important to them. They put a lot of effort into doing this. The other thing that we know is that
monkeys actually also put a lot of effort into respecting the kinds of
hierarchies they find themselves in.

The monkeys that you see in the hot spring are just a
small group of the monkeys in any group that's come
upon the hot springs. Because the hot springs are kind of an
exclusive club, only the high ranking individuals
get to go in. And this means that the low ranking
individuals have to stand out on the side in the cold, often
in the snow, Waiting there, while the kind of
relaxing, sort of, royalty of the monkey world gets to go
in them. And the question is, why don't the low
ranking individuals just kind of fight this or
jump in? We don't know exactly the answer to that
question, but what we see is tremendous respect for the hierarchy,
even in cases where it could mean a low ranking individual could freeze in
this sort of situation, or not get the kind of comforts to which it feels
it should be accustomed. But it's hard to actually measure what
this really means for the monkeys. How much do they think they need to toe
the line when they're dealing with high ranking individuals who
tell them what they should and shouldn't do. And Horner and colleagues tried to get at
this in a slightly different way. What they were trying to do is to ask
whether in this case chimpanzees, would be willing
to actually toe the line when they saw information about
how one is supposed to get food, in a sort of, simple
tool task.

And so I'll show you what this looks like. This work was actually conducted out at
the Yurkey's Field Center, which looks
something like this. So chimpanzees live all in this big group
over here. And the way they were able to teach them
about this new tool was to sort of, set up this sort of funny tool set up on
the side of the cage over here. And chimpanzees in this tool setup were
allowed to put different tokens into one of these objects
to get out food. Now all of the, the objects that you could
put tokens into would actually work. But the chimpanzees were given a choice of
which one they wanted to use. And they varied, of course, the kind of
object that you set up. Sort of the different look of the
different objects. All of them are going to work just as well
to get food out of. Question is, who did you see using each of
the two objects before you came? And they varied the particular individuals
that the, the chimpanzees got to have access
to. One of the individuals was the highest ranking female, the alpha female of the
group. She was using the weird object on the
left, the black one. The other individual was a low ranking
member of the group. She was actually using the object on the
right. Question is, the subject knows both of
them work. He gets to see these individuals use the objects, and the question is,
which of the object is the subject himself choose
to act on? They both give food, but what you find is that the chimpanzees don't treat them
that way. What the chimpanzees do is about 90% of the time, they're imitating the other
high-ranking individual. Suggesting they either feel that that
one's more valuable, they're trying to be like the high-ranking
members, maybe they think they're supposed to do it this way,
maybe they think it's sort of the moral thing to
do. We don't know exactly the reasons why, but what we do
see is that in their behavior, the chimpanzees are paying a lot of attention to what the other individuals
do. And they're conforming to what they see
the high status individuals doing. In much, at least the same behavioral ways
we see humans doing in a lot of societies. So that's what we know about hierarchy
norms in, in nonhuman animals and what we've
seen is of course, lots of individuals seem to care about hierarchy, this sort of pecking
orders across all kinds of different taxa.

And we also see that some individual
species, in this case the rhesus monkeys, care
about status. They're willing to pay for information
about it and they also seem to act in ways that are like it. What we don't yet know if nonhuman animals
also have some of the features that we have in our own society where they really
moralize this authority structure. Not as something they sort of have to do because they'll
get punished if not, but as something they, they think they ought to
do and other individuals ought to do. These are really open questions in this
domain, but the exciting thing is that researchers
now have some methods where they can start tweaking
these things apart and potentially asking some
of these questions.

And so, I'll turn to the last domain here. And this domain of fairness and
reciprocity. And again, like suffering and harm, this
might be one where you think, okay, this is a spot where humans are completely different than
nonhuman animals. Of course, again, we're sitting here in a
law school in a classroom. No other species are doing these kinds of
things. Probably no other species would be willing
to take the kinds of costs over equity that we
see.

This is the Occupy Wall Street folks that
are off in New York right now. We're inside not in the rain, these guys are sitting outside in the rain over
things that they perceive as violations of
justice and equity that are going on in Wall Street. And no matter what you think about this
you might think that humans are doing some pretty costly things when
it comes to dealing with their own equity
norms.

Question is, do we see these kinds of
things in other animals, too? Do animals even care about reciprocity? Do they have these intuitions about
fairness and how it works? And perhaps most importantly, do, will
they take a cost like we will to punish those who
behave unfairly? And so you've already seen in the course a little bit about the fact that non-humans
care about equity. I think that Professor Bloom talked before about the case of vampire
bats who seem to reciprocate in their, sort of, blood
barfing to one individual or another. I'm showing you this image to show that
seems like these guys care a little bit about
cheating. This is an individual diagram, which is
showing a vampire bat behavior where one bat is actually rubbing
the tummy of another bat. What he's doing is to check and see if the
tummy is distended, because, you know, you might lie about what you ate for dinner,
but your tummy doesn't, and so if the tummy's
big, then there's some expectation that this
guy's going to vomit. But clearly some, something like
reciprocity going on behaviorally.

Also see other asp, other examples of
things like tit for tat and reciprocity in the animal
kingdom. This is the case of the black hamlet fish. This is actually black hamlet fish in
flagrante delicto. So if you're don't want to be looking at black hamlet fish porn you might turn
away. It's even more a little bit scandalous in
that these guys are actually hermaphrodites. So one of the problems when you're a black
hamlet fish and you want to mate is that you have to decide who's going to be the male and who's going to be the
female. It's not just a problem for sort of social reasons, it's actually more of a
reproductive problem, because it's bad to be the female in the sense that your reproductive effort is giving up
an egg. Which is very large, it's very
reproductively costly. It's much easier to be a male and just
give up a single sperm for your reproductive effort. So what black hamlet fish do is that they
turn-take, they do a little bit of a tit-for-tat about who is
the female first, and then the next one will do it, and then
as soon as an individual defects, you can see that
both individuals will swim away. And choose not to mate with each other in
the future. So we see these kinds of cases of
reciprocity in animals, but can we really see examples of
true fairness empirically. Not just the kind of anecdotes of
behavior, but real cases where we ask animals about fairness.

And again Franz De Waal and his colleagues
were able to ask this in the species that I work with here
at Yale, capuchin monkeys. They were able to capitalize on a
phenomenon in which capuchins are actually somewhat willing to
share food with each other. So, if one individual has this kind of,
whoops, this big bowl of food there, and there's
another individual without food, sometimes that individual will choose to
kind of eat next to the other guy sort of dropping crumbs of
food so that the other guy can take it. Again, rather than sort of sit all the way
on the other side of the enclosure so that you're
not near another individual. What Frans said is, well, maybe we can
capitalize on this food sharing to ask if the monkeys really care
about fair payment for labor. And they did that by setting up this sort of bar pulling task that was slightly
tricky. Both capuchins had to work together to get
access to food, but only one of the individuals, the guy on this side, was
going to get any food in his little bowl. And so he set up two different kinds of conditions to see
whether these capuchin monkeys first would share and whether they
would share fairly. One of the situations was cooperative. So in one of these cases the two capuchin
monkeys had to work together. The subject monkey who got the food got
helped by the other guy. The other condition was solo. The other guy didn't help at all, he just
kind of sat there and the first guy did all the
work. The question is does the capuchin monkey
take that into account when he decided how much food
to share. And the answer is in fact that he does. These red bars are cases where the two
capuchins worked together, and then what I'm plotting is the number of
food pieces that got shared. What you can see is that in both cases,
even over trials capuchin monkeys were wiling to share more in cases where
the other guy helped them out. The sort of sense of perhaps something
like fair payment for labor. De Waal and colleagues also actually
looked at whether or not capuchin monkeys, an
individual capuchin monkey might expect that he's
going to get pair, paid fairly. And this is in a series of studies by
Brosnan and De Waal trying to look at whether monkeys expect to get
paid the same amount as another monkey. In this setup, they did something similar to Christy's experiment that I showed you
before. The monkeys are actually going to be
trading tokens for pieces of food but they are going to in
different amounts.

One of the monkeys, this monkey who's the stooge, who's not the subject of interest
is actually going to get paid something yummy. He's going to get a grape or something
delicious. The other monkeys going to get paid
something that's worthy, something he would
ordinarily find okay. But it's just kind of okay. It's not like super great. It's something like a green pepper, a
piece of cucumber or a monkey biscuit. And the question is, even though we know ordinarily monkeys would find these kind
of meh foods okay, do they react negatively to
them when they know another individual is
getting paid more? And what Sarah Brosnan and colleagues found, I'm going to sort of
skip this slightly weird video here, but what they found is that capuchin monkeys
do care about this a lot. In the cases where they got the lower
award, when another individual got more, you saw situations in
which monkeys actually refused to exchange, so they just through the
token they were supposed to trade out and wouldn't trade it with
the other experimenter. You also saw situations in which they
refuse to accept the reward. This is an otherwise good piece of food that a capuchin won't like,
but as you can see in this picture the monkey
sort of throwing it on the floor because it's
not nearly as good as what the other guy got
before. It seems that monkeys care about cases in which they get less than another
individual.

But it seems that this is true not just
of, capuchin monkeys, it seems to extend broader, more broadly
across the taxon than we might have, thought. In fact, Range and colleagues actually
looked at whether pet dogs were able to show the same kind of
aversion to inequity. And they did it for, by paying the dogs
not to trade But to do this, sort of, simple kind of handshakey gesture
that, maybe many of your dogs know how to do. First they did the handshakey gesture with
this border collie, who is the subject, she got paid a very
low reward. Then the dog to the right did the
handshakey gesture and she gets a very good piece of
food. You can see this border collie on the left is looking like, wait a minute, what's
going on? Question is, do we see the same kind of
thing, a refusal to participate, or a refusal to eat their
rewards, and in fact you do. I won't show you the data I'll just show you this lovely picture of a border
collie, like aw, like that is like the biggest
border collie dis in the history of border collie
disses.

But the upshot is that you see these kinds of behaviors where within the animal
kingdom, you see an aversion to at least one kind of inequity, kind of inequity I'll call here
disadvantageous inequity. These are cases where you yourself, the
subject, are getting worse than someone else and you
react negatively. But this is the limit of it. It turns out, if you look across the
animal kingdom, you don't see cases of a different kind of inequity
aversion that you might expect. And that's a case that you might call
advantageous inequity aversion. This is a case where there is inequity,
but you are benefiting. Somebody else is getting less than you,
but it's not fair. And this is the kind of thing we do all
the time. I mean, these are what the folks who are out at Occupy Wall
Street are worried about. Many of them are people like Cornell West
or Russell Simmons. you know, they're not hurting and getting their houses foreclosed on, but they still
think something's unfair, even though they might
potentially be benefiting from the folks on Wall
Street. They're still willing to protest. And this, it turns out is something it
turns out we don't see in other animals. If you look at the two cases I showed you,
you can get hints of this right here. you know, check out the dog who is getting
the bigger one, you know this other dog is reacting
in horror but he, the second dog's kind of like well I'll
trade with you, if you're willing. you know, he's not sort of stomping off
and starting a protest, he's totally happy to go along with the situation where
he's getting more of a reward. Sarah Brosnan reports the same kind of
thing in capuchin monkeys. She reports that sometimes when this
monkey throws the reward away, the second monkey will reach down
and take it. you know, like well, if you're not taking the scraps, you know, I'll take them
myself. Right. These aren't the hallmarks of advantageous
inequity aversion like we'd expect to see in humans. And so this seems to be a big difference
between what we see in our own species and other
species. But there's another difference in the
domain of equity and fairness that I think is really
important. And that's cases of whether animals are willing to punish these violations of
equity. And you've already seen, I mean, of course
you know from lay behavior that humans do this all
the time.

You've seen cases experimentally in which
humans are willing to do this. Like in the case of the Ultimatum Game. So if Professor Bloom was pan, playing
this game with you guys in class, and your partner had
all this money, and he was only giving you two
bucks of all that wad of cash, you might reject the
offer. And say you won't take it. You'll take a cost, to deliver this
punishment to another individual. And a group of researcher in Leipzig,
Germany were able to do the same kind of thing with
chimpanzees. The way he did it was with a similar sort
of pulling setup. This guy over here would be the proposer
chimpanzee. And he gets to make the first selection of a couple different,
different reward distributions. So this one at the top looks like it's
pretty fair for both individuals. you know, the proposer's going to get this
one, the other guy gets this one. This one looks a little bit unfair, you
know, he's only going to get two. But this guy makes the first selection. But he only gets to pull it a little bit.
It gets stuck. At that point, the second guy has to chime
in and do the complete pull. What this means is it's exactly like the
setup of the ultimatum game you guys played. One of you is making an offer, but the
other guy chooses to accept and reject. The capuchin, the chimpanzee in this case,
can choose to reject just by not doing that second
pull. So he could reject the offer if he chose
to. The question is, does he do it, and under
what situations does he accept? And what the critical cases in the study
were, were cases where the proposer chimp had the option to
do something fair. He could choose a distribution of raisins
that was five or five Or he could do something
unfair, he could choose eight and just give the
other guy two. And the question is, which did the
proposer choose? Turns out proposers in this case were
relatively unfair, but the more interesting question is what did
the receiver do? And what you find is that chimpanzees don't play like humans, they play like
economists. Because what they do is that they actually
never reject the unfair offer. As long as the other chimpanzee offered
them something that was above zero, they were willing to
accept it. They rejected the zero offers, but they
took any amount of food that was there, suggesting they're not willing to
inhibit this urge to take this bad payoff. They can't sort of stand up and punish the
other individuals for their unfairness. In fact if you look across human populations, the chimpanzee performance
looks only like one other population of humans, and that's
populations of humans who have lesions in their brain. Fact Ernst Fair and his colleagues were able to study this by
actually creating temporary lesions in normal human
brains, so you'd bring undergrads into your lab, and you
introduce them to this wonderful device Called a
transcranial magnetic stimulator. I won't get into the details of how this
works, but basically it creates a magnetic pulse that develops a small and temporary lesion wherever the coil is
positioned. So you put the coil in front of this spot
in undergraduates' frontal cortices, gave them an unfair offer in the ultimatum
game, and what he found was that none of the folks he did this to
actually showed any rejections. They could say, yeah, it was unfair, but
they took the two bucks anyway. And, this is the hint that I think is
really important from studying animals is we see maybe the
spot where we start to see some differences in the
behavior of animals and humans, maybe our inhibitory control in
this is actually quite helpful.

And so in terms of reciprocity and
fairness what have we learned? Well we've seen lots of animals do things
that are reciprocal, they perform actions that
seem very tit-for-tat. Not always clear what the psychological
mechanisms are. In the same case we see lots of examples
of animals in this case rejecting some of
these unfair payoffs. But little evidence that they care about
advantagous inequity. They just care about their own stake in
equitable situations. And we see strikingly little evidence of
costly punishment across other animals. This might be something that's truly
unique to our own species. So now I've gone through all these other
cases, in the short time I have left I actually want to turn to these issues of what we can actually learn from studying our
closest non human relatives. And when I was thinking about developing
this lecture, I really wanted to stay true to the goals of
the course. So I could've shown you more studies on
different moral concerns in animals, but I thought I would sort of think more about
at least some of the goals that were stated in the syllabus of this course. And if you look at the syllabus, hopefully
some of you have, you know, looked at the syllabus, probably
important to do, you would just see is that goals of thinking about morality
in humans, of course, is to understand some aspects of transcending
kindness and all the good things we do. But also these era, areas of unspeakable
cruelty. And most of the time, when we're looking for moral concerns in animals,
we're thinking about the kindness part, we're thinking
about stopping harm and helping and all this
stuff. But we really might get more insight into
our own nature, or at least the part of our nature that we
really need to come to grips with if we take
seriously this idea of trying to study the principles
that underlie unspeakable cruelty. And what I mean here are these cases where
humans can be aggressive and violate the moral norms
of, of societies in ways that are completely egregious and
involved lots of lethal aggressive harm often to individuals who are a part
of different out groups. you know, if I had to put my finger on the biggest moral atrocities of human
culture they would all have this flavor of a large
scale violence, group on group, often pretty
aggressive and pretty lethal.

And so if you want to take a look at where
this stuff comes from, you might say okay,
let's take a broad swash. We'll take the whole animal kingdom, and
we'll ask, where do we see this stuff in other
species? you know, it's in us, we do these awful immoral things, gotta be all over the
place, right? No. If you look at all the species out there, the only two
species in which you see lethal aggression are those two
little red points over there. And if we scroll in, we see that it's just us, and one of our two closest living
relatives. Not both of them, just one of the two. So here we can scroll in at a slightly
different version of that tree, looking at the other
ape relatives that we have, and we're really scrolling
in on the branch that includes just us, and our two
closest living relatives, chimpanzees and bonobos. And as you've seen from some of your
readings, we can course unfortunately see lethal
violence in us. We also see this sort of hallmark in
chimpanzees, but we don't actually see it, in bonobos, who are equally
closely related to us as the chimpanzees. So what's going on? I thought I'd end the lecture today by
kind of scrolling in and seeing if we can get some
insight. And the insight starts by sort of looking at chimpanzee society and what we know
about it. And the great thing is that we know a lot
about chimpanzee society, mostly from the
starting pioneering work of Jane Goodall and
colleagues. We start to look at what chimpanzee
society was really like and they learned lots of great things
about chimpanzee society. They learned lots of information about how
chimpanzees use tools and were more cognitively
sophisticated than we thought. But they also learned lots of negative
things that chimpanzee society isn't the kind of idealic bliss that we
might have thought. And I'll give you a little quick video to
give you a sense of what what some of this
actually involves. See if this works here.
>> In the tree of life. >> Can you guys hear? >> Are often occupied by species that
look poles apart. But sometimes, what separates species is
more social than physical, as it is with our closest relatives,
chimpanzees and bonobos.

[MUSIC] [SOUND] Chimpanzees and bonobos live in
similar jungles in equatorial Africa.
They look alike, live in the same size communities and eat similar foods.
Yet. [SOUND]. Violence is a fact of life for
chimpanzees. Battles between neighboring communities
are common. [SOUND].
So is the physical abuse of females. >> Oops.
It got cut off. But you can basically get the point here. What we're dealing with is a species that,
if you look at its natural behavior, of course it looks nice sometimes, but it bears a hallmark to a relatively violent
species. Lots of intragroup violence. Individuals who are beating up on
individual females. There's cases of infanticide. It doesn't look very pretty, but it
actually gets worse if you look at how the intergroup violence among
chimpanzees actually plays out, because we see lots of hallmarks of a species that cares a lot
about what's going on in the other community and whether you can resources potentially from that other
group. So what you're looking at here is a picture of chimpanzees who are giving pant
hoots. These are vocalizations that are useful for keeping the chimpanzee communities
together. And the idea that chimpanzee communities
range over a big amount of space, as you saw in the Jane
Goodall article. The goal is that they have to keep tabs on
where everybody is, not because there are other predators for chimpanzees out
there, although man is a pretty bad predator for
chimpanzees. The biggest issue is potentially violence
from other individuals, and the pan, who is, is worth hearing, I don't have a
vocalization, but it goes something like this, is like, [SOUND] and so that's, you
know, if you hear that, you're like, [SOUND] you know, this is a scary-ass
thing, yeah, you're, yeah, this is good. [SOUND] But see, my pant hoot is not that
good because if you were a community of chimpanzees that didn't know
me, you would react, not with clapping but like
this. If you were a male you would drop the food
out of your mouth, literally, reach over and grab the penis of the guy
next to you and just say, you know, are you with me man, because there's another chimpanzee over there,
he's pant hooting so. [LAUGH] Maybe next year I'll get good
enough. That, you know. But the point is is that inter-community, inter-community
interactions are incredibly scary. Why? Why do they have mechanisms to sort of promote and worry about where everybody
is? Well, the reason is because of what you've
already seen, which is that the way that communities typically
interact is one that involves a lot of lethal aggression. This is the case of chimpanzees being much more quiet than they're normally used to
being. They're sort of hunched down and engaging
in a border patrol, where they're leaving their own confines and going to an
area that's outside their territory. Why are they doing that? Well, you know, there's lots of
speculation but what do they do when they get there and they find a
lone individual? They often do horrible things like this,
where the individuals together will gang up on an individual
chimpanzee, often one that's weaker and smaller than them, so
it's not like they're doing this in self
defense. And when they're done, you see images of
chimpanzees that look like this. This is a little bit gory, so turn away if
you're scared. But they look like chimpanzees that don't
look very good when they're done. What you can see is this chimpanzee has
gash wounds all over his body. If you look here, his testicles are
actually missing. In this case of this chimpanzee, they were
found down the road. So this doesn't result in very pretty
things for chimpanzees. You can look back, the gory chimpanzee is gone. But in cases where this has been studied
in detail, where you can document across communities how this plays out, we
sometimes get very scary answers to what we've seen. And you guys read in the case of Jane
Goodall's report, what happened in Gombei over the course of four
years in the 1970's. Basically what happened was that there
used to be two communities of chimpanzees, and
over time if you look back four years later, it ended up just as one community of
chimpanzees. What happened to the other communities? Well you guys saw it, I'll depict it a
little bit here, not with, photos of the chimpanzees
because we don't have them, but by, what I think is a really fabulous artistic
exhibit by a photographer named Allison Raton who did a photography
project on the four years at Gombei. And the way she did it was to depict what
happened not with chimpanzees but with humans which I think is sort of
far more compelling if only disturbing. But what Jane Goodall described as you saw
as a case where these two communities used to
be one. They used to all be kin and then they
slowly split over time into being sort of separate communities that were a little bit more
individualized. And this was all well and good, until the
researchers started seeing more and more of these kinds of
late night border patrols. Cases where individuals went over, and as
they started seeing more and more of these border patrols, they also
ended up finding more and more kahama Chimpanzees who were killed in
often very, very brutal ways. And as time went on and the researchers
paid more attention, they could actually see
instances of what was actually happening. Where chimpanzees were, as I showed you,
very quietly, in this border patrol getting together and seemingly ganging up on another
individual. Often one that was less strong than them
and less helpless. And as this happened over time, more and more members of the kahama community died
until all the males in that community were in
fact, dead. The females left and transferred into the
northern community, and that was that for the
kahama community. So I think we see it with human terms,
that often feels more compelling. But what are the similarities here? We a lot of similarities in the chimpanzee
legacy with what we see in human warfare. We see this lethal coalitionary
aggression, what does this mean? This means deadly force on the part of
bodies of individuals who leave their group and go to a neighboring
group, seemingly for the purpose of causing
warfare, or causing aggression. There's also the hallmark that happens not within the group but between groups of
individuals. And it typically, as Richard Raynom often
points out only involves males and that the
targets of these things are mostly males or at least, they seem to be targeted towards
individual males. And there also seems to be something like
the spoils of war, where the victors in these cases get
access to more land, more resources, in this case even
more females. So, this is our legacy and it's a hallmark of something we should find very
disturbing because there's a lot of similarities in terms of what's
happening in chimpanzee lethal violence and what's
happening in humans.

But of course, there's this other case I
was talking about, the case of the bonobo, our equally closely-related
relative, who doesn't show any of these hallmarks. Can we figure it out if some sense what
went okay with the bonobos to cause them not to have some
of this stuff? And so for them, we sort of turn to bonobo
social structure and bonobo social structure looks a lot more
laid back than you see in chimpanzees. And its in part because they don't seem to
have the kinds of violent society that we see in
the chimpanzee society. You see no inter group violence. No lethal rating. In fact cases of inter group interactions
are always quite pleasant with individuals
behaving very socially. You see extremely little intragroup
violence. Males just aren't as mean to females as
they are in chimpanzees. And as I said finally, little male
violence towards females, no evidence of infanticide, it just seems
like a very chill, happy society. Well, what is going on? Well, it seems, as researchers have put
forward, that if you study bonobo social behavior,
the bonobos are in part, not violent because
they seem to choose to make love not war. Seems that socio-sexual behavior in the bonobos seems to be a really
important mechanism by which they get around a lot of these
problems of violence. And I'll leave it to Amy Parish in this video to tell you a little more about
that. >> For the past decade, Amy Parish has
been observing bonobo behavior at the San Diego
Wild Animal Park. She's seen them go at it in every way
imaginable. [MUSIC] >> This gets a little dirty, so you can
hide your eyes. >> [LAUGH] >> You get standard heterosexual
interactions which are often face to face, the way they are in humans. You also see what we call ventral upright
matings where a male and a female will hang together out of a tree
suspended and have sex. Males have sex with other males in what we
call rump-rump rubbing, where they stand and
rub their scrotums together. We also see something among males called penis fencing, where
males will suspend off of branches by their arms and rub their erect
penises back and forth. [MUSIC] >> And then a very remarkable behavior
in which two females rub their genital swellings
together in rapid sideways motions. [NOISE] >> So, what's allowed bonobo females to establish such peaceful relations with
males? [NOISE] Parish believes the answer is
female solidarity. [NOISE] >> By cooperating with each other and
solidifying their bonds and reducing any tension that
does exist, they're able to form alliances with each other and
cooperatively dominate males. And this changes the whole balance of
power and the whole social dynamic in the group and makes it
radically different from chimpanzees. >> And why bonobo females evolved this
strategy when chimpan. >> Whoops, we'll get to that part
later.

But the upshot is that Paris's hypothesis,
and the hypothesis of others, is that it seems like some of the violence gets cracked
down upon in part because females have these
strong bonds. The males can't co, form coalitions to
get, against them because the females have their own sorts of bonds
and coalitions themselves. And so this raises the kind of
million-dollar question in the field of primatology right now, which is, why is it that female bonobos can develop these
bonds, but bonobo why is it that bonobo females can develop these bonds but chimpanzee
females cannot? And this leads to I think the ongoing
hypothesis that Richard Wrangham has been pushing with, which has a book of the same title, called The Demonic Males
Hypothesis. The idea is that something about the
coalitionary behavior of males that's due to ecology
drives these kind of patterns. And again, I'll leave it to Richard to
tell you himself. >> And why have the noble females evolved a strategy and chimpanzee females
haven't? >> It looks as though a relatively
simple change in the feeding ecology is responsible for this dramatic
difference in sexual behavior.
They, the nobles live in an environment. Where you have herbs much more
continuously on the ground. And there are chimpanzees that live in
similar forests, but wherever those forest are occupied by chimpanzees,
they're also occupied by gorillas. >> The gorillas eat the food on the ground, leaving the chimpanzees heavily
dependent on fruit trees. To get their share, the female chimps
forage alone. >> The mothers with babies ranging in
age from one to about five, can't move as quickly as
the males. I mean, one infant is up here playing in a
tree, and a couple are nibbling slowly and the mom has had to
sit and wait for them. So its absolutely typical that the males
reach the big feeding ground first. And the males have finished all the food
by the time the mothers arrive. So the mothers, disperse, away from each
other and away from the males. And that means they can't have much
opportunity to form bonds with each other. >> The simple fact that there was food
available on the ground appears to have been the force that drove
the evolution of bonobos. Wrangham believes the catalyst was a
long-lasting drought two million years ago in what is now
Zaire. The plants and the gorillas that depended
on them died. It was tough on the chimpanzees, but they
could live from the fruit in the trees. When the rains and the plants returned,
the gorillas didn't. [MUSIC] Now the chimpanzees can get to the food on
the ground. In time, they evolved into bonobos. It's been suggested that, that same
drought forced our ancestors out of east Africa's forests and
onto the plains. >> And once you had drying in a Savannah area, then conditions became
quite harsh. It was impossible, for early humans to
travel around in groups together in the ways the bonobos do, and therefore, for females to
form alliances and dominate the males in the
way that happens in bonobos. But a little bit different climatic
history. A little bit different in our food history
and we might of evolved to be a totally different, more peaceful, less violent, more sexual
species. >> More sexual species is what he's
ending on there. But, but this is the idea behind the
demonic males hypothesis and it's one of the few reigning hypothesis that we do have for the difference between
chimpanzees, bonobos and the idea here is that, because
chimpanzee females weren't able to form bonds together, they
develop psychological mechanisms that prevented them from sort
of clamping down on the violence in the same way that
bonobos can. And this has led to the kinds of violence, the kind of inner group violence you see
among chimpanzees. The sort of run away selection on the
coalitions between males that can't be clamped down by females
because of feeding ecology. The claim is that the same kinds of
mechanisms led to the kind of inner group violence that we
see in humans. Something of the same kinds of mechanisms
that led to the inner group violence that we see in chimpanzees are probably in us too to the
extent that our feeding oncology was pretty to
similar to chimpanzees. Question is what are the psychological
mechanisms? And you know, how can we kind of deal with
them or sort of clamp them down? And these are big questions that we don't
have big answers to but we get good hints by studying the
similarities and differences between us and our closely
related primates. And folks are now trying to look at these
sorts of issues. But, rather than talk about that, since we don't have good answers to these kinds of
puzzles, I'll sort of talk a little bit about,
well, what are some of the conclusions we can
make? What are some of the moral insights we can
get about humans from turning to animals? And I'll kind of return to where we
started, which is this idea that even since Darwin, we've known that
we have this conflicting view of animals as moral agents. This idea that like, of course we're
different from the lower animals, of course our moral sense is the
important thing that separates us, but on the other hand we expect
animals to have something of a moral sense and the question is, what
is that sense? And what we've learned is that, at least
some of the universal hallmarks of human moral
concerns, some of the universal domains in which we care about moral issues, we
see those same kinds of domains cropping up in animals
where they care about hierarchy. They care about helping others to feel better. They care about sharing inform, food and
information, about where things are. And they care about actually doing nice
things for others. We also see important limitations in all
of these different domains. What we've seen is that, in the case of
capuchin monkeys, it matters to whom you're doing these nice kinds of
things, and to whom you care about equity. It matters what situations under which you
show it. And in the case of equity specifically, we've seen that other animals care about
equity, but only in these do, in, in the cases where it
actually applies to themselves. They care about disadvantageous
situations, but not advantageous ones. And finally, I think we've seen perhaps
the most important difference which is that
even though animals have all these hallmarks of what
it means to have a moral concern, we see no evidence that they, step up to the plate when those moral concerns are violated and
are willing to take a cost to punish other individuals, as in the case of the
ultimatum game. Seems like we alone may do this, and we alone may do this for this interesting
reasons. Which is that we have brains capable of
inhibiting prepotent desires like, oh, just take the
two bucks. Or oh, just do the easy thing. We can step up to the plate in part
because we have these mechanisms that allow us to inhibit
desires that we would normally want to fulfill. And in the second half we sort of switched
gears from these universal moral concerns, all these
aspects of kindness that we see to try to see if we could get some insight into the unspeakable cruelties that our
species are capable of. And what we dealt with was that we really
need to come to grips with the fact that we share a chimp legacy of
inter-group violence, one that's not shared throughout
the animal kingdom. But it is shared between us and
chimpanzees. And what we realized is that we might be
able to turn to cases of chimpanzee inter-group violence and to the
evolutionary pressures that led to that, to get some insight into
what's going on in our own inter-group violence. And the scary thing that I think we
learned is that whatever those pressures were for
chimpanzees, they seemed to most likely be the same pressures that led
to our own psychological mechanisms and our own
cases of inter-group violence. Again, we don't have great insight into
what exactly those mechanisms are, but we know
that they're the ones that are shared with chimpanzees
and perhaps no other creature out there on the
planet. And sort of that's where we are, and I
want to end with sort of some of the implications
of some of this stuff, because I think there's another
worrying part of this evolutionary story that we need to deal with, which is
that chimpanzees have all the psychological mechanisms, and, and
devices that they have, their own strength and size, but we go beyond
all of those things. Because part and parcel of our own human evolution is developing our own forms of
weapons, and these weapons are way more awesome
than weapons we see in the other animal
kingdom. I mean, they are capable of real lethal coalitionary aggression. You know, in nuclear holocaust, we can do these things with the weapons that we have
developed. The especially scary thing is that, unlike
the weapons of the animal kingdom, we've developed these things really quickly in evolutionary
time. Absolute blink in evolutionary time. And we've gone from just being humans with
sticks to humans with nuclear weapons. And what that means is that we probably
haven't done the evolutionary work that other
animals with weapons have done to develop restraints through
natural selection that deal with the behaviors under which we use
these weapons. These bull elk aren't willing to use their
weapons. They go through really careful
trajectories to decide when they're appropriate, and they're always
restraining from what they could do. It's not clear that humans have build the same evolutionary mechanisms to deal with
our own weapons. And that I think is the scariest
evolutionary message. The hopeful message though is that what
we've seen is that some of the differences between the moral senses
of us and other animals should be the ones that give
us hope. Because what I'm telling you is that one
of the things that we have that it seems like animals might
not bring to their, on their own moral concerns, are really
rich processes, we're inhibiting our own desires and sort of curbing what we'd
really like to do. We also have a lot of cognitive
flexibility that we can bring to bear. Basically, taking the old mechanisms that
he have for kind of coalitionary aggression
and maybe switching them around in positive ways. It's not clear what the policy messages
are for these kinds of things. But I think a few quick things come to
mind. One is we should use in our, our,
inhibitory control to stop the proliferation of
really bad weaponry. Given that we don't have the good bull elk
skills of curving these things we might, use, need to use our frontal lobes
to cut some of these things down. The other thing we should probably do is
get creative with our coalitionary groups. One of the cool things about hum, being a
human is that we form groups on the fly. We can be Americans or Red Sox fans or
Yale Students, and so on. We can create these groups de novo. And one possibility is to start creating
coalitionary groups that actually make sense from the perspective
of limiting lethal inner-group violence. Making new kinds of coalitions across old
separate groups that can actually promote, being a more
peaceful, more moral species. And finally and this is Richard Wrangham
and not exactly me, you ask Richard Wrangham what
you would need, what we as a species need to do to develop a moral utopia, what he says is
that you just have to get rid of all the males. And then we'll be a moral utopia. He's that, slippery slope about his
species, but, I think that this isn't exactly the wrong kind of idea
because perhaps thinking about ways to make political power a
little bit more equal, not just across the sexes, but across
different nations and so on, is probably a worthy goal, for an
equitable species like us and hopefully can allow us to achieve
our hallmark. Of being the true moral species that I
know we can be. And with that I will shut up and just
thank you guys for listening. But also, end with an advertisement
because, if you want to learn more about all of these topics, I invite you to take
my class in the spring. You'll see lots more of bonobos doing
dirty things. And if you're interested in studying these topics yourself you can come join my lab where Christie and others are focusing on all these issues.
Thank you so much. [SOUND]
