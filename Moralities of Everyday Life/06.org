For the third case study of how our
emotions can influence our morality, I want to go back
to the trolley problem. So remember when we discuss the trolley
problem, and the main finding in the trolley problem is for the bridge case;
people are willing to throw the switch. They often think it's the right thing to
do. To throw the switch that would kill one in
say five. But they're unwilling to push the man.
They're unwilling to kill him. And say five.

Now, remember we had an analysis of this. We said this might be because people have
this abstract philosophical principle that sees, sort of, a subtle
difference between these two, and for instance, the principle we talked
about was, in the switch case, the guy dying is an accident,
doesn't do any good. In the bridge case the guy dying is
essential. He's an instrument through which to bring
about the good. And this was the analysis we had.

But there's an alternative. This alternative was proposed by Joshua
Green and has a lot of support. The alternative says, that's not what's
happening at all. And he introduced his alternative. He introduced his approach to morality and
moral thinking in, in a paper published in the Journal of
Science, with various collaborators. And what he did was, he had people solve
trolley problems, like reason about moral problems, while they were
hooked up to an fMRI. That is a brain scanner. And he looked at the activation patterns
in different parts of their brains as they reason their way
through moral problems. This is what he found.
So look first at the switch case. He found that the switch case activated
parts of the brain in the frontal cortex, the part of the brain
that's up front here. And these are parts of the brain that are typically involved concious
deliberative reasoning. And these parts of the brains would be
active and people would make their choice. And often their choice would be, yeah they
should throw the switch, that makes sense. Five lives matter more than one life. A very utilitarian intuition.

What about, the bridge case? Well here the same part of the brain, was
active. Presumably doing the calculations of, five
versus one. But also, various other parts of the brain
that are involved in conflict and emotion,
emotional feelings, light up stronger. And, for these sorts of cases, people say
that you shouldn't push the man. The way Green analyzes this is, it's not
that there's some sort of subtle philosophical principle that
governs the difference between the switch case and the bridge
case. Rather, there's sort of two aspects of our
moral psychology. There's controlled rational processes. And the controlled rational processes are,
under Green's view, largely utilitarian. They just calculate consequences in a very
cold-blooded way. But there's also automatic, involuntary,
gut feelings. And so what Green says is, for the switch
case you just map. You, and so you have choosing you have one life and five lives to control process,
chug away. And you typically say well, you know,
better to save five. Even at the expense of one. But for the bridge case, emotions light
up. It's not just a cold blooded calculation
one and five, but also this gut feeling. And the gut feeling lights up for green.
Not because of any principle or structure. It's, it's the idea that this visceral
feeling of putting your hands on somebody and
shoving, causes emotional response. That's what's driving it. It has nothing to do with the doctrine of
double effect, or anything like that. It's an emotional response to the physicality of pushing somebody to his
death. And so this is, as you can see, a very
different analysis than Kant's. And Greene collects other data that
support his analysis. And so, for instance, and ask yourself
this question. Imagine it's the bridge case, but now, instead of
having to push them in, you have a switch. So, it's a lot switch, you have a switch
case, it's a lever, you pull it down, and when you
pull it down and when you pull it down a trap door
comes in and he plummets in front of the train and
saves the five. Would you throw the switch, would you pull
the switch to stop the trap door? Well, if it was this abstract philosophical issue where
these principles of using them as an instrument, it shouldn't
use make any difference whether you push them, or
whether you throw the switch, but it makes a profound
difference. People are much more likely to say it's
okay to throw the switch, than to push them in. We also know from other research that
people can be influenced in their choices on the
switch case and a bridge case by fiddling with their
emotions in various ways. So my favorite example of this is, how do
you make people more likely to say it's okay to push the
man off the bridge? Show them something funny. So they, so, the researchers found some
very funny clips from Saturday Night Live, they showed em to people, people
laughed, and then they asked bridge case. And they said, now people said, yeah, I'll
push em. Suggesting that there, that, that there aren't these abstract emotion, sorry, the abstract rational principles
guiding our choices here, but rather, gut feelings
played more of a role. And I think all of these three case studies taken together, thinking
about disgust, thinking about bodies and about lust, and thinking about the emotional reaction to
physical contact. Bringing up somebodys death, all support the view that, that Hume would adopt.
That in the domain of morality, reason is, and ought only to be, the slave
of the passions. [MUSIC]
