So, why would people matter to us?
Where does compassion come from? You can imagine different possibilities. You can imagine people have compassion of
a sort, just out of selfishness. It might be that your pleasure matters to
me because in some way we're in the sort of a relationship where you
being happy leads to be being happy. Maybe we're sort of business partners
working together or something or we're in some sort of mutual
benefit system, where your benefit is my benefit
and your suffering is my suffering. I'll leave it for a question for later
whether this even counts as compassion, but it's one source
of nice behavior towards others. We might care about other people because
of our religious code. You could imagine we care about other
people because we believe that God wishes us to. We might care about other people because we are committed to some philosophical
theory of morality of the sort we discussed
earlier like consequentialsm or Kantian theory in which other people's happiness
and feelings and goals matter to us.

But many people have argued that a lot of
what of goes on in compassion comes from our gut,
comes from our heart. It is not a, it's not for self-serving
benefit, nor is it because of our belief system. But, rather it's because we're wired up to
care about other people. And the specific proposal as to what could
drive compassion, and some people argue drive morality more
generally, is that empathy plays an important role. So, let me define empathy.
Empathy is based on a German word. The term is a new term, it was coined in
the early 1900s, and it means to feel one's way into and when you
think about empathy, you can think of it as being in someone else's shoes, putting yourself in someone
else's shoes. Now, the idea that empathy plays a big
role in, our morality and our compassion, is something
again, you find in Adam Smith. So, Adam Smith argues that sort of
foundation for caring about other people, is
imagining yourself in their shoes. And he gives an example of how this can
be, can be done. He says when, when we see a stroke aimed
and just ready to fall upon the leg or arm of another person
we naturally shrink and draw back our own leg or arm and when it does
fall, we feel it in some measure, and are hurt by it as
well as the sufferer. Now, once you start looking for examples of how empathetic connection,
affects you, you can see them all over the place. Here's one of my favorite examples. It's, It's a picture from a wonderful book called Emotional Contagion and you can see
the guy is tensing up in anticipated feeling of
the pain of the needle of the child he's
holding. And you know, I saw the movie Casino
Royale, the James Bond movie a little while ago. And there's a scene where the character
James Bond is shackled naked to a chair and then whacked
in the testicles. And me and I think just about every other male in the theater is going oh, in
vicarious pain.

But it's not just pain, it's also
pleasure. I'll show you one of my favorite Youtube
videos. I'll show you a brief clip of it. And this video is, I think, is watched so much because it
just gives people pleasure. >> [SOUND]
>> [LAUGH] [LAUGH] >> [SOUND]
>> [LAUGH] >> [LAUGH]
[SOUND] >> [LAUGH]
>> So, What's going on with that? Why would anybody enjoy watching another
person laugh? Well, because somehow the happiness of the
kid jumps from him to us and so it's hard to watch a video
like that without being sort of cheered up a
bit because we're naturally primed to take on the
perspective and feeling of others.

And in fact, when people develop theories of empathy,
theories drawing upon psychology and neuroscience, they often see it as
related to a more general, propensity to imitate other people, to be
the people we are interacting with.
Here is an example of the imitation. A soccer player has just missed a big kick
and he, he puts his hand on both sides of his head.
But now, look at the people around them. We imitate each other all the time. There are studies showing that, when you
have two people who are talking to each other, they'll unconsciously start to
imitate the, the, the behavior of the other. My wife, when she's with her Texas
relatives, she starts to drawl. And in fact, whenever you're talking to
somebody with an accent, there's this irresistible
temptation to start speaking that accent too. It's part of how we respond to other
people. And it shows up like a lot of what I'm
talking about, even in babies. So, the developmental psychologist Andrew
Meltzov, many years ago, found that, that babies are natural
mimics. Here is a clip of him making different facial expressions and a baby making those
expressions back at him. And you watch a mother or father with a baby, where you'll see is this sort of
dance as it were, where one of them will make an expression other one will do it back and
so on. Some people have argued that there's a
specific neural system that underlies this
imitation, underlies this empathy, known as mirror neurons. And mirror neurons were first discovered
with, non human primates. And what they are is they're activated
when you do an action like reach for something. But they're also activated, when you observe another individual do the same
action. And this suggest that, that at some neural
level there's no distinction between us and them. There's no distinction between you and
another person. As we experience the, the, imitate the
motor movements of another person you could feel a connection to them and this imitation could itself drive, drive
empathy.

So, one demonstration of this involves
facial expressions and here the excellent works been done by the
psychologist Paul Ekman. So, Paul Ekman points out there's certain
universal facial expressions. Humans all around the world have them.
And I've shown some of them here. They're, you go around, the list there,
anger, fear, disgust, sadness, happiness, and
surprise. These are universal.
But what's interesting is two things. One thing is you'll naturally mimic
someone's facial expression. So, if you're sitting across from me and
I'm frowning. You'll start to frown. Also when you imitate the expression, due
to the facial feedback that, that, that ensues you'll start to feel the
same feelings that I'm feeling. So, if I'm really happy and I'm grinning
like a idiot, you'll start to grin like an idiot and if you grin like an
idiot it'll make you happy. Some of the most annoying advice you can tell a depressed person is you should
smile more. This is incredibly annoying but it's true.
It's true for two reasons. One is, if you smile people will smile
back at you and they'll like you more. But the second one is, and there's,
there's laboratory studies on this, the very act of going like this, of
moving the corners of your lips upwards triggers the feelings
typically associated with smiling, that is, happiness and smiling in some
small way, boost your mood. It might be parenthetically that that is
mirroring of, of others and, and our propensity to do so and the pleasure we get from doing so, could exlpain some mysteries of
human psychologies. And these are mysteries that go quite a
bit beyond the questions of morality we are interested but I can't
resist talking about it here. So, I am going to show you a little clip. I am going to show it's, I'll show you one
minute of this clip, and it's from a series of
videos called, Where the Hell is Matt. Where this sort of non-descript guy dances to music with different people across the
world. So, I show you this clip, the last like,
minute, minute five seconds and as your watching it, monitor your own,
for example monitor what your doing. And second, monitor your own feelings. [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [FOREIGN] >> [MUSIC] [MUSIC] We were all dancing here, me, the camera
guys, everybody. That's one thing. One thing is upon seeing this, you'll be
tempted to move with it. This is most extreme in children. My sons and I, when they were younger, we'd watch a lot of kung fu movies
together. And they can't watch a kung fu movie
without leaping up and kicking people and things,
and so on. It's just irresistible. But second, not only are you tempted to
move with it, but often there's some sort of warm feeling
associated with it, some human connection. And this illustrates how other people's
movements and your movements, and your propensity to
imitate these movements lead to sort of connections of feelings, and connections of positive
feelings. And this could be viewed as a
manifestation of empathy.

So, let's step back. You have concern for others, other people
matter to you. And you have empathy which is putting
yourself in other people's shoes. And you can do empathy through an act of
imagination. You could think I wonder what it's like to
be her and think about that. I wonder what, what his experience is like. But you could also do it viscerally by
seeing another person, act in some way. The theory worth taking seriously then is
that empathy is a spark for compassion. And it's not hard to see how this could
work. Let's assume, because it's true, but it's
kind of obvious, that I don't like feeling pain and so if I feel pain,
I'll want to stop that. But let's also assume that if I see you in
pain I'll feel your pain empathy, and I'll want
to stop that. Because by stopping you from feeling your
pain, I'll stop me from feeling, my pain. Suppose I see you happy and that makes me
happy, I'll want more of that because I like
being happy. You can say that empathy dissolves the
boundaries between yourself and another person. And so, this predicts that when you are in
empathetic state with somebody, when you are taking their persperctive, you will adopt their
interest. You will care about them.
You will feel compassion and concern. And there is a fair amount of evidence
that this is true.

A lot of work comes from the psychologist
Dan Batson. And Batson has done dozens of studies, perhaps hundreds of studies by now, where
he, he gets people in a situation where they have to choose whether to help somebody or whether to care about
somebody. And he finds that if he can get them to
feel empathy, to see it how they feel, to see
it how, how the other person sees it, to feel it as
the other person feels it, the odds of them being kind and
caring go up. So, for instance, you could tell a story
about a girl who is in line for a life saving operation, and
there's other people ahead of her, and then if you just ask the person,
ask your experimental subject, try to take this girl's perspective, try
to see it as she seen it. That raises the odds your willing to take
that girl and move her up to the front of the line, that you're
willing to rescue her. Because the shared feelings motivate
compassion. They motivate caring.

In general, this effect, the fact that empathetic connections with individuals
boost up your feelings towards them is the spark of what sometimes called the identifiable
victim effect. The identifiable victim effect is the idea
that we care a lot more when there's a person in front of us
than some numbers. And, and this is something which has been
observed by many people. Joseph Stalin apocryphally said, a single
death is a tragedy. A million deaths is a statistic. Mother Teresa said, if I look at the mass,
I will never act. If I look at the one, I will. And there is actually experimental work
done demonstrating this, so, there's, a series of wonderful studies
done by Deborah Small and Paul Slovic and George Loewenstein,
where you give people the facts, you give people data about a
crisis, involving numbers and hard facts and you see how
much they care. And, and how much they'll donate. And in this example where they throw out a
lot of statistics at people, your average person hearing it
will give about a dollar. But then another group, you tell about an
individual, an individual with a name and with a face.
And this bumps it up considerably.
There are some studies that find that you will care more and give more to
save one person with a name and a face, than
five people who you are not told their names and you are
not shown their faces. And this I think shows the power of
empathy. Now, nothing that I'm saying would be a
surprise to those who spend their lives trying to get people
to give to charities. So if you look at the, at the ads for charities, they don't say, okay, here's
our charity, here's the statistics, here's the data, here's the graphs, and so
on. They'll show you a picture. They'll tell you about an individual.

I know this from personal experience. When I was in graduate school, I was
extremely persuaded by Peter Singer's argument which I talked
about in a previous lecture. That we need to give much more to charity,
that, that we are doing something wrong by not, by, by
spending money on luxuries instead of giving the money to save people's
lives. I was very persuaded by this and still am
kind of. And I would tell this to my friends. I tell this to my fellow graduate
students, and, and you know, we'd be out for a beer and we'd be drinking a beer and I would say you know that beer could save a
child's life. And, and you are murdering a child, and me
too, by drinking these beers. And at one point one of my graduates, one
of my friends who was a graduate student, a philosopher
actually, got really sick of me. And he said, how much do you give to
charity? And I was sort like well, dude, it's a
philosophical argument here. But I thought, well nothing, actually. And I was poor graduate student, but I was much richer than the people I was
concerned about. So, I decided I should give money to
charity. So, I sent away, and this is pre-internet,
so I sent away a postcard to an organization,
Child Reach and asked for information. And I remember getting the packet and I
remember opening up the packet. And I remember expecting to see a lot of
information about what their charity does and how they work and where
the money goes and so on. But they were much smarter than that. I open up the packet, and there in it was a picture wrapped up in plastic of a small
child. And the letter said, Dear Mr. Loom, we know, we know you
have not commited to giving us any money. We know, we know you're just asking for information and that's, that's fair
enough. But, but we have enclosed a pictrure and
then he told me that this is, and he told me the
child's name. And they said, we know you are not
committed to giving us money. But if you do give us money, this is the life you will save. And that is psychologically so much more
powerful than, than data and then facts. And, and, and actually my family's still
sending money to that, to that child and his family many,
many years later.

Now you, you could argue further that the
kindness the boost we get from empathy is, can motivate kind behavior not just to
individuals but to the groups that the that those
individuals belong to. And this is a claim defended by the
philosopher Martha Nussbaum. So, Nussbaum writes, talking about Greek
tragedies, although all of the future citizens who saw ancient tragedies were male, they were asked to
have empathy for suffering of many whose lot
could never be theirs, such as Trojans and
Persians and Africans, such as wives and daughters
and mothers. And her argument is that one of the things
fiction can do, fiction, also journalism and stories, movies, T.V. shows, is they
can put you, get you to have empathy. Get you to put you in the shoes of those
who you wouldn't otherwise be, be with. And by doing so, you might care not just
about, about that individual, that fictitious
individual, but rather the group that the individual belongs to.
My own, my own bet, is that feelings in America towards, homosexuals
were radically affected by situation comedies like Will and Grace, which showed
gay people in a positive way. Made you root for them, made you care for
them, put yourself in their shoes. Attitudes in America towards
African-Americans, I think, were transformed by shows like The Cosby Show, which again put
people in the shoes of these, these
African-Americans who were perfectly fine and fun and enjoyable, and people you
could sympathize with. And then the sympathy expanded to the
group as a whole. Now, this is largely speculation. But we do know, historically, that there
are cases where fiction has caused interesting and important moral
changes. And one example has to do with Harriett
Beecher Stowe. The story goes that, Abraham Lincoln
invited her to the White House at the beginning of the Civil War and said to her, so you're the little lady who's caused this great
big war. And he was talking about Uncle Tom's
Cabin, and Uncle Tom's Cabin is not a book of great philosophy or legal reasoning or, theology
or morality. It's it-, it, it's fictional. But what it does is, it get, it got the
readers who were predominantly white people, some
of whom were slave owners, to put themselves in the shoes of of
slaves and see what their experience was and by doing so,
served as a catalyst for moral change. So, I have argued that empathy could be a
force for morality, both at a individual level but also maybe as at
the group level too.

In further support of this, I think we
could look now at precisely what's wrong with people, who
don't care about other people. People who lack compassion. And this brings us back to psychopaths. So, psychopaths also known as sociopaths,
you can use what ever term, they're not
sensitive. They're typically male. To be a psychopath is defined by all sorts
of characteristics. A clinical psychologist named Hare
developed a psychopathy test. If you're curious about yourself you could
take it online. Psychopaths tend to be selfish, they're callous, they're impulsive,
they're promiscuous and have a deficit in normal feelings. They have a deficit in love and loyalty
and guilt and shame and anxiety. They tend to be cold blooded characters. Psychopathy comes in all sorts of flavors. In some extreme cases you have these cold blooded psychopaths who are also very
violent people. And these people cause so much of the misery in the world. I'll give you a few quotes to give you a
feeling for psychopathy. you, by the way when you think of a psychopath you may well think of
Hannibal Lector. Who is a classic Silence of the Lambs
psychopath. But I tend to think of James Bond to show you that they're not all necessarily
bad guys. Some of the psychopaths might be on our
side. But James Bond also fits many of the
characteristics. The Daniel Craig James Bond, not the Roger
Moore James Bond. So, so, how do psychopaths talk? How do they think? Well you have to use extreme examples one
of them which was reported by Damon in his book on morality is of a 13 year old who
who would mug blind people. And he'd mug blind people because he
figured they couldn't identify them, him later. And he was then asked later on, so you
know, don't you care about the people whose lives you
destroy, the people you assault? What about this woman you just attacked? And his response, I think, perfectly
captures what a person is like without compassion. He said, what do I care?
I'm not her. And in some way that's a good argument.
You're not her, why should you care? Well, because humans normally are usually
wired up to care, but it's hard to figure a logical
argument, why you should. Ted Bundy, who was a serial killer, was
once, once in a, in an interview while in prison, expressed surprise at the fuss
that was made, on, that all of his murders. He said at one point, you know there are
so many people, he was kind of puzzled why people were so concerned. And, one of the creepier examples, and
this is from Jon Ronson's excellent book The Psychopath
Test, is a guy named Peter Woodcock. And and this guy he he had raped and
murdered 3 children and ended up in a psychiatric facility for
the rest of his life. But he did get a three-hour leave to walk
around the grounds after some years of good
behavior. In the course of this, he invited a friend
of his who was also on this leave to join him for a walk, and
then killed his friend with a hatchet. So, he was asked, interviewed later about
this event. And, and here's how he described it. So, the interviewer says, asks, what was
going through your mind at that time? This was somebody you loved. And the psychopath answers, curiousity,
actually, and an anger, because he had rebuffed on my
advances. And why did you feel someone should die as
a result of your curiosity? I just wanted to know what it would feel
like to kill somebody. And the interviewer asks, but you had
already killed three people. And Woodcock replies, yes, but that was
years and years and years and years ago.
So, what's wrong with psychopaths? Well, one answer is, that among their many
deficits, they don't have normal empathetic
feelings, towards others. They don't feel other people's pain, they
don't feel other people's pleasure. And because of that the suffering that
they caused doesn't come back at them, it doesn't resonate. Some people have argued that along with
all of their deficits including empathetic deficits there's something very
specific, very specific that's wrong with them.

And this comes from the work of the
psychologist Abagail Marsh. So Marsh did a series of studies where she
took psychopaths who were in her lab and she showed them a
series of faces. And the idea is you have to identify the
face. What emotional expression, you,
correspondents to that face. So, they would look at the face, on the, on the upper left and say, boy that woman
looks angry, and they look at the face of the
guy in the middle bottom and say that's one
happy guy. But there was one sort of face, that they
had a lot of problems recognizing. That is, they would look at that face and
they wouldn't have the foggiest idea what the person was feeling, though for a
normal person, it was it was obvious. So, the face I'm talking about is in the
top middle. It's fear. And Marsh argues that psychopaths have
this specific deficit, empathizing with the fear of
other people. She tells a story of, of, of a study, an
interview, with actually a female psychopath, who identified all of the
faces easily, except could have no idea what fear was. And then, finally, it came to her, and she
said,' I don't know what that expression is called, but I know it's
what people look like, right before I stab them.
And I'll end with that.
