I agree with Adam Smith that we have
compassion towards those we are close to. I think he's right that you don't need any
examples to show that. But when it comes to strangers, the issue
is quite a bit more complicated.

And actually the theme of how we think
about strangers, and the way our moral psychology interacts with strangers,
is to me so interesting and is important, that we're going to return to it over and over and over again, in the lectures that
follow. But I want to to introduce the idea, here. And I want to sort of, for us to consider
how we think about strangers, and, to, to, to introduce this idea, I'm
going to give a lecture in four parts.

So, the first part is an observation, and
it's an observation by the primatologist and anthropologist Sarah
Hrdy. And Hrdy, at the beginning of her
wonderful book, Mothers and Others, describes being
on an airplane. So she had been through security, she had
been groped by the TSA agent, she's kind of crabby, she's
sitting in a seat, she's, and, and, and the food is coming, you
could smell the food, you could hear people in front of you
getting it But she's, but it hasn't got to her yet. And somewhere on the plane, a baby starts
crying. And people roll their eyes, and they're
stuck together. And to pass the time, Hrdy writes, I
cannot help from wondering what would happen if my fellow human passengers suddenly morphed into another species of
ape. What if I were traveling with a plane load
of chimpanzees. Any one of us would be lucky to disembark with all
10 fingers and toes still attached. With the babies still breathing and
un-maimed. Bloody earlobes and other appendages would
litter the aisles.

Compressing so many, highly impulsive
strangers into such a tight space, would be a recipe for
mayhem. Yet millions of us, billions of us, fly
each year. And it's very rare that the plane lands and then they open up the
doors and it's coated with blood and body parts
and everything. We behave, we sit quietly, we wait our
turn. And this is, this is extraordinary. This is an unusual response to strangers. As Hrdy points out, chimpanzees and other
primates, our closest evolutionary relatives, are
nowhere near as nice. The response to dealing with the seen strangers, if you're a non-human primate, is often panic, is
often aggression. But not for us. We are able to cope with strangers, we are
able to inhibit our violence, our aggression, our frustration in the
presence of strangers, and that's the first
observation.

The second part of this lecture, discusses how it's even better than that. It's not just that we don't want to kill
other people who we were not used to. Rather is that, to some extent, we resonate to them, and we want to help
them. And I think the, the clearest examples
here are the internet. So any of us who spend a lot of time on
the internet, and the fact you're watching me suggests you spend some time on the Internet, spends a lot of time dealing
with strangers. Spends a lot of time dealing with people who aren't your friends, aren't
your family. You never met them before. Yet we often have these productive,
complicated interactions with strangers that aren't
obviously self-serving. Now admittedly some of these interactions
are not necessarily compassionate. Sometimes they're aggressive. Many people spend a lot of time on the
internet arguing with strangers. This classic XKCD comic indicates the fact
that it is extremely frustrating to deal with the somebody on
the internet who is wrong. And there's a tremendous impulse to
correct them. And the comment section on blogs refelcts
this very human implulse. I wouldn't want to call that compassion,
but there's a lot of what seems very cleary to be
compassion and, and one example of this is sites with
reviews. I'm thinking of Amazon and TripAdvisor,
Travelocity, Yelp. These are sites that describe things like
books, or products or restaurants, and then people come in and
they, and they review them. And they tell you what they think of them.
So I was looking for a bookshelf the other day, and I went online, and I found this. And it's a ladder shelf, and I'm going to
buy it, because over a thousand people have commented on it and most of
them say nice things about it. And, now some of these people may be
motivated by gratitude in some way. When there is a negative review, you could
say is revenge or vengeance. But for most part, people are going on to say, oh, I really
like this show and what they're telling you is, they are,
they are doing something for you. They are doing you a favor, but they don't
know you. And this is altruism for the strangers,
and it's a, it's an extraordinarily interesting
fact about human nature.

Now, there's other examples in the real
world. When giving lists of irrational, not self
serving behavior people often describe tipping. So, it's one thing to tip in a restaurant you're going to come back to
because the size of your tip could affect your own, how people think of you, how people respond to
you. But people leave tips in a restaurant they
know they'll never going to go back to. They put money on the table. and, and even though they'll get no
benefit from it. Or as an even more extreme case, think
about, hotel rooms. And this varies from culture to culture. But there's, th, th, there's a custom in
which I was raised in, that you're supposed to leave a tip when
you leave a hotel room. So you, you know you pack up and
everything and you put some money down. You maybe write a note that says thank
you. The interesting thing about this is, this
cannot conceivably help you in any way. It's not like the people who clean the room are going to say what a wonderful
guy. I'll go back and do him a favor one day.
They don't even know who you are.
Yet we are compelled to do this. We might feel embarrassed if we forgot. We may feel ashamed of ourselves. We may feel proud of ourselves if we do
it. And this goes to show that our morality is
plugged in, in an interesting way, towards our interactions with people who we don't
know, we will never know, we will never meet
again. There's charity. People give an enormous amount of money to
charity.

Now, some of these charities are
self-serving in a way. If I give money to support a museum that I
myself am going to enjoy. Sometimes, the impulse to give to charity,
may be an impulse to enhance our reputation, to show
ourselves off as good people. Oh, look at, you know, I am donating this
amount of money. I get my name listed in some program and people say, what a great guy he is.
But some of our charitable acts are none of these.
People give money to international charities to help starving children, and
we often do this anonymously? No feedback, nothing.
We do it because we feel it's right. We are compelled, we do this because we
feel it's right and because we care about other
people, again, people we will never see.

This was this was the topic of a wonderful
experiment by Stanley Milgram. Now, we're going to meet Milgram later on
in the course because Milgram did some very famous
experiments looking at human cruelty. He did a famous set of experiments finding
that, based simply on instructions you're given, your average
person will kill another person. But Milgram was also interested in
kindness, so he did this great study. And he did this study in New Haven,
Connecticut, which is the city I'm now in and the city I teach and the city that
Milgram was a professor at back then. And what he did was, he had letters made
up. They were stamped, addressed letters. And so he made them up. And they'd say, with a person's name, I
forget the name, you know? Joe Smith and an address.
And he went through the streets of New Haven, or had his students do it, and would drop
them. Or he'd put them up on a windowsill. Or he'd slip them under a door. None, none of them ended up, he didn't put
any of them in a mailbox. So here's the question. How many of them would get, would be sent?
They knew where they were sending them. They had to check the mailbox where it's
supposed to be sent to. How many would be sent?
In order for them to be sent, somebody has to pick up
the letter, say oh, here's a letter. Go to a mailbox and drop it in. That was well over half. Well over half of these letters arrived at
their destination. And this means that people must have
picked up the letter and said, oh gosh, this is a letter that somehow went
astray and put it in a mailbox. Again, an act which will do, which leads
to no self-serving benefit. But it's simply done in some sense out of
the goodness of your heart. Now if your cynical you might say maybe
there's employees of the city or maybe people just
automatically did it. But Milgram did something clever. Some of the letters were addressed to a
person. Some of the letters were addressed to an organization that he felt people
wouldn't like. So some of the letters were addressed to
friends of the Nazi party. When they had that address they didn't
arrive at the destination. So, it's not that they were
indiscriminately looking at it and throwing it in a mailbox. Rather people were making a decision. And if it was for something which they didn't think was good, they wouldn't send
it. There was even another study done by Dan Festler in California,
where he looked at different things. But one of his conditions was, he did the
same study as Milgram, except he didn't put a stamp on the
letter, he just addressed it. Now most of those letters did not get
back. But about 10 to 20% did. Which means people picked up a letter said
oh, here's a letter for somebody it has no
stamp. They went, they got a stamp, they put on
it, and they mail it. And I think this is just extraordinary, I think this says something
very interesting with how we work.

So call those two stories the bright side
of things, that's the positive side of our
feelings to strangers. But there's also, as you could imagine, limitations about our compassion
to strangers. There's, there's limits as to how much we
care about them compared to how much we about the
people around us.

And the third case I'll give you is, is actually part of a comedy routine by Louis
C K. This is unusual because it's the only
Louis C K excerpt in which he doesn't swear. But he says something very interesting
about our relationship to strangers.
>> My life is really evil, like I,
there are people who are starving in the world, and I drive
an Infinity. That's really evil. There are people who just starved to
death, that's all they ever did. There's people who are like born, and they
go, I'm hungry, and then they just die.
>> [LAUGH] >> And that's all they ever got to do. And meanwhile I'm in my car, boom, boom
like having a great time and I sleep like a
baby. It's totally my fault because I could, I
could trade my Infinity for like a really good car like a nice Ford Focus
with no miles on it. And I'd get back like $20,000. And I could save hundreds of people from dying of
starvation with that money, and every day I don't do it. Every day I make them die with my car. [MUSIC]
>> Now Louis C.K. ends by saying,
everyday I make them die with my car. And of course it's a joke. This isn't literally make them die. He doesn't literally kill them.
He has no malice towards them. He's not acting to kill them.
But in another level, it's not a joke. Another level, it actually reiterates a consequentialist argument that we've seen
before. That one should judge actions based on
their consequences. And from that point of view, if its true,
that by buying a car instead sending the money to a
charitable organization, if its true that this leads to the death of some kids, then
Louis CK has killed them just as much as if he ran them all
over with his car. Now this is a radical claim. It's a strong claim. It's in part the view of the philosopher
Peter Singer who's a who is a consequentialist and who argues that
we should judge our acts based on our consequences,
and because of that, we should radically change how we
how we treat people and, and, and our
charitable giving. And he has a moving philosophical argument
of which the conclusion is we should do more to help people in far
away lands. And I have a feeling that, that Louie CK
in his routine has actually drew upon the insides of Peter Singer. I'm going to present the argument right
now. What's interesting is this argument,
although it's been presented in philosophical journals and elsewhere, it's
now presented as a Youtube video.

So, this is the fourth and final case of
how we think about strangers and it's expressed in this extremely
interesting video. [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] That's a political argument, it's a social
argument. And, you may not believe it. You may object to it. You may disagree with it. You may endorse it, think it's very
convincing. That's not the point here. My point is not to persuade you to do one
thing or another. Those are your own decisions.

But what I like about this video is that it illustrates certain things,
certain psychological truths. And one truth it illustrates is that
there's a psychological distinction between three
categories of people. One category is the stranger in front of
us. The girl we see, we know we don't know,
but the girl we see drowning in the pond. The second category is an anonymous
stranger, the one we don't see, the girl in Africa drowning in a pond.
And then the third is the family member, our own daughter, our own mother, father,
sister, brother, son um; and these are three categories of people and um; and we
think very differently about them. And one insight is, when our natural
reaction to them, is that we could care a lot about those in
our life. People we love. People we, we interact with. And we are also driven to care a lot about
a stranger, a drowning girl in front of us, as if
seeing her triggers something. It triggers a sense of obligation. If I told you that I, I he'd, Singer never
tries to make the argument we should help the
girl in the pond. He just assumes it.
And he's right to assume it. If I told you, I was rushing to work and
there was a girl drowning, but I was kind of in an hurry,
so I let her drown. You'd think I was a monster, and you'd be
right. So you have on the one hand your feeling towards family members, your feelings
towards people suffering for any. And then your feelings towards anonymous
strangers. That's very different. We don't have the same pull. If I told you I knew about children in far
away lands who were starving to death, who needed medical
care, and I still bought a nice car, well, you might think I shouldn't be doing this,
but you wouldn't think I'm a monster. In fact, most of us do stuff like that all
the time. So you have these psychological
distinctions. And this helps explain our moral reaction
to a case we talked about in the very first
lecture. So remember I told you the story, true story of these
two guys who go in to the casino and one of them molests and kills the child, and
the second one doesn't do anything. He just observes it, but he doesn't stop
it. And later on he's interviewed on this,
because they don't press charges, not a crime to just not
help a stranger. If I walk past that drowning girl in the
pond, I might end up saying morally wrong, but I haven't done
anything legally wrong. And then he's asked, so what was up with
that? And he says, the simple fact remains I
don't know this little girl. I don't know people in Panama or Africa
who are killed every day, so I can't feel remorse
for them. And, you know, he's missing something.
So he's actually right in his second claim.
The people in far away lands if you're not in Panama, if you're not in
Africa, you're not typically going to care about
people who suffer there. It's okay not to do anything to help them. But that girl in front of you, the person in your vicinity, that person you should
care about. Now, Peter Singer uses these psychological
facts to make a moral argument. So he starts by saying he would help the little girl whose in front of
you, and people watching you and say, yeah of
course. Well, isn't that just the same, as if she
was drowning in, in, in Africa? And then later on he says, oh, well maybe
you think the girl in Africa is just a drop in a
bucket. But what if she were your daughter? Isn't that the same?
She's somebody's daughter. And so what you see here is an
appreciation of our gut instincts. Singer is well aware that you don't
normally think of the girl in Africa as we're saving, as
we're sacrificing for. But he tries to argue through analogy that there's no real
difference Between her case and the case, the cases where you do think you'd
be right to intervene. And, among other things, this shows us the
limits and the scope of compassion but it also
illustrates moral argument. It illustrates how people could try to use
reason, to try to use arguments, analogies, examples to change the way you
think about the world. And I think this is deeply significant and
it's another topic which we're going to continue to discuss, as
these lectures develop. [MUSIC]
