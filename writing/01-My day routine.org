I usually get up at ten past 8 in the morning.
It is very hard to do it because of cold weather.
After a few struggle, I will get up because I need to learn English on time.
I walk out of the bedroom, close the door carefully in order not to wake up my wife who is pregnant.
I rinse off the toothbrush, squeeze some toothpaste over it, and brush my teeth.
I always take a piss, but sometime pop, which is contingent on my stomach.
I heat my bread in the microwave oven, which is made of wheat because I am losing weight.
I put my clothes on while my cat is going to play with me.
I sit down and enjoy my breakfast at the table.
A cup of milk helps me more energetic.
After all this done, I begin to read my English aloud.
