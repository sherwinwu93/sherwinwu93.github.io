<h3 id="org0a82d0c">The development of the London underground railway 15| 15| 5 5 5 4</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0a82d0c">
<p>
In the first half of the 1800s, London's population grew at an astonishing rate,<br />
	and the central area became increasingly congested.<br />
In addition, the expansion of the overground railway network<br />
	resulted in more and more passengers arriving in the capital.<br />
However, in 1846, a Royal Commission decided<br />
	that the railways should not be allowed to enter the City,<br />
		the capital's historic and business centre.<br />
The result was that the overground railway stations formed a ring around the City.<br />
The area within consisted of poorly built, overcrowded slums<br />
	and the streets were full of horse-drawn traffic.<br />
Crossing the City became a nightmare.<br />
It could take an hour and a half to travel 8 km by horse-drawn carriage or bus.<br />
Numerous schemes were proposed to resolve these problems, but few succeeded.<br />
</p>

<p>
Amongst the most vocal advocates for a solution to London's traffic problems was Charles Pearson,<br />
	who worked as a solicitor for the City of London.<br />
He saw both social and economic advantages in building an underground railway<br />
	that would link the overground railway stations together<br />
		and clear London slums at the same time.<br />
His idea was to relocate the poor workers<br />
			who lived in the inner-city slums<br />
		to newly constructed suburbs,<br />
	and to provide cheap rail travel for them to get to work.<br />
Pearson's ideas gained support amongst some businessmen<br />
	and in 1851 he submitted a plan to Parliament.<br />
It was rejected,<br />
	but coincided with a proposal from another group for an underground connecting line,<br />
		which Parliament passed.<br />
</p>

<p>
The two groups merged and established the Metropolitan Railway Company in August 1854.<br />
The company's plan was to construct an underground railway line<br />
	from the Great Western Railway's (GWR) station at Paddington<br />
		to the edge of the City at Farringdon Street - a distance of almost 5 km.<br />
The organisation had diffculty in raising the funding for such a radical and expensive scheme,<br />
	not least because of the critical articles printed by the press.<br />
Objectors argued that the tunnels would collapse under the weight of traffic overhead,<br />
	buildings would be shaken<br />
	and passengers would be poisoned by the emissions from the train engines.<br />
However, Pearson and his partners persisted.<br />
</p>

<p>
The GWR, aware<br />
		that the new line would finally enable them to run trains into the heart of the City,<br />
	invested almost $250,000 in the scheme.<br />
Eventually, over a five-year period, $1m was raised.<br />
The chosen route ran beneath existing main roads to minimise the expense of demolishing buildings.<br />
Originally scheduled to be completed in 21 months,<br />
	the construction of the underground line took three years.<br />
It was built just below street level using a technique known as 'cut and cover'.<br />
A trench about ten metres wide and six metres deep was dug,<br />
	and the sides temporarily held up with timber beams.<br />
Brick walls were then constructed,<br />
	and finally a brick arch was added to create a tunnel.<br />
A two-metre-deep layer of soil was laid on top of the tunnel and the road above rebuilt.<br />
</p>

<p>
The Metropolitan line, which opened on 10th January 1863,<br />
	was the world's first underground railway.<br />
On its first day, almost 40,000 passengers were carried between Paddington and Farringdon,<br />
	the journey taking about 18 minutes.<br />
By the end of the Metropolitan's frst year of operation,<br />
	9.5 million journeys had been made.<br />
</p>

<p>
Even as the Metropolitan began operation,<br />
	the first extensions to the line were being authorised;<br />
		these were built over the next five years,<br />
		reaching Moorgate in the east of London and Hammersmith in the west.<br />
The original plan was to pull the trains with steam locomotives,<br />
		using firebricks in the boilers to provide steam,<br />
	but these engines were never introduced.<br />
Instead, the line used specially designed locomotives<br />
	that were fitted with water tanks in which steam could be condensed.<br />
However, smoke and fumes remained a problem,<br />
	even though ventilation shafts were added to the tunnels.<br />
</p>

<p>
Despite the extension of the underground railway,<br />
	by the 1880s, congestion on London's streets had become worse.<br />
The problem was partly<br />
	that the existing underground lines formed a circuit around the centre of London<br />
			and extended to the suburbs,<br />
		but did not cross the capital's centre.<br />
The 'cut and cover' method of construction was not an option in this part of the capital.<br />
The only alternative was to tunnel deep underground.<br />
</p>

<p>
Although the technology to create these tunnels existed,<br />
	steam locomotives could not be used in such a confined space.<br />
It wasn't until the development of a reliable electric motor,<br />
		and a means of transferring power from the generator to a moving train,<br />
	that the world's first deep-level electric railway, the City &amp; South London, became possible.<br />
The line opened in 1890, and ran from the City to Stockwell, south of the River Thames.<br />
The trains were made up of three carriages and driven by electric engines.<br />
The carriages were narrow and had tiny windows just below the roof<br />
	because it was thought that passengers would not want to look out at the tunnel walls.<br />
The line was not without its problems,<br />
	mainly caused by an unreliable power supply.<br />
Although the City &amp; South London Railway was a great technical achievement,<br />
	it did not make a profit.<br />
Then, in 1900 the Central London Railway, known as the 'Tuppenny Tube',<br />
	began operation using new electric locomotives.<br />
It was very popular<br />
	and soon afterwards new railways and extensions were added to the growing tube network.<br />
By 1907, the heart of today's Underground system was in place.<br />
