Humans of New York

"He makes me want to know about little things, so that I can teach him.
Like when we sit by this lake,
	I wish I knew what kind of turtle that was, so I could tell him.
And I want to figure out what kind of duck that is,
	so I can tell him all about it the next time we come."
"What do you want most for him?"
"Whatever his dreams are, I'm down to ride for him."
"What's your biggest fear for him?"
"That he won't try.
If he doesn't try, I'll be hurt.
Cause then we'll never know how far he'd get."
