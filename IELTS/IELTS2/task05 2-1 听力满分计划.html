<p class="verse">
Labyrinths have existed for well over 4,000 years.<br />
Labyrinths and labyrinthine symbols have been found in regions<br />
&#xa0;as diverse as modern-day Turkey, Ireland, Greece, and India.<br />
There are various designs of labyrinth<br />
&#xa0;but what they all have in common is a winding spiral path<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;which leads to a central area.<br />
There is one starting point at the entrance and the goal is to reach the central area.<br />
Finding your way through a labyrinth involves many twists and turns,<br />
&#xa0;but it's not possible to get lost as there is only one single path.<br />
<br />
In modern times, the word labyrinth has taken on a different meaning<br />
&#xa0;and is often used as a synonym for a maze.<br />
A maze is quite different<br />
&#xa0;as it is a kind of puzzle with an intricate network of paths.<br />
Mazes became fashionable in the 15th and 16th centuries in Europe,<br />
&#xa0;and can still be found in the gardens of great houses and palaces.<br />
The paths are usually surrounded by thick, high hedges<br />
&#xa0;so that it's not possible to see over them.<br />
Entering a maze usually involves getting lost a few times<br />
&#xa0;before using logic to work out the pattern<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and find your way to the centre and then out again.<br />
There are lots of dead ends and paths which lead you back to where you started.<br />
The word 'maze' is believed to come from a Scandinavian word for a state of confusion.<br />
This is where the word 'amazing' comes from.<br />
<br />
Labyrinths, on the other hand, have a very different function.<br />
Although people now often refer to things they find complicated as labyrinths,<br />
&#xa0;this is not how they were seen in the past.<br />
The winding spiral of the labyrinth has been used for centuries as a metaphor for life's journey.<br />
It served as a spiritual reminder<br />
&#xa0;that there is purpose and meaning to our lives and helped to give people a sense of direction.<br />
Labyrinths are thought to encourage a feeling of calm<br />
&#xa0;and have been used as a meditation and prayer tool in many cultures over many centuries.<br />
<br />
The earliest examples of the labyrinth spiral pattern have been found carved into stone,<br />
&#xa0;from Sardinia to Scandinavia, from Arizona to India to Africa.<br />
In Europe, these spiral carvings date from the late Bronze Age.<br />
The Native American Pima tribe wove baskets with a circular labyrinth design<br />
&#xa0;that depicted their own cosmology.<br />
In Ancient Greece, the labyrinth spiral was used on coins around four thousand years ago.<br />
Labyrinths made of mosaics were commonly found<br />
&#xa0;in bathhouses, villas and tombs throughout the Roman Empire.<br />
<br />
In Northern Europe, there were actual physical labyrinths designed for walking on.<br />
These were cut into the turf or grass, usually in a circular pattern.<br />
The origin of these walking labyrinths remains unclear,<br />
&#xa0;but they were probably used for fertility rites which may date back thousands of years.<br />
Eleven examples of turf labyrinths survive today,<br />
&#xa0;including the largest one at Saffron Walden, England,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;which used to have a large tree in the middle of it.<br />
<br />
More recently labyrinths have experienced something of a revival.<br />
Some believe that walking a labyrinth promotes healing and mindfulness,<br />
&#xa0;and there are those who believe in its emotional and physical benefits,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;which include slower breathing and a restored sense of balance and perspective.<br />
This idea has become so popular<br />
&#xa0;that labyrinths have been laid into the floors of spas,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;wellness centres and even prisons in recent years.<br />
<br />
A pamphlet at Colorado Children's Hospital informs patients<br />
&#xa0;that 'walking a labyrinth can often calm people in the midst of a crisis'.<br />
And apparently, it's not only patients who benefit.<br />
Many visitors find walking a labyrinth less stressful than sitting in a corridor or waiting room.<br />
Some doctors even walk the labyrinth during their breaks.<br />
In some hospitals,<br />
&#xa0;patients who can't walk can have a paper 'finger labyrinth' brought to their bed.<br />
The science behind the theory is a litle sketchy,<br />
&#xa0;but there are dozens of small-scale studies<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;which support claims about the benefits of labyrinths.<br />
For example, one study found<br />
&#xa0;that walking a labyrinth provided 'short-term calming, relaxation, and relief from anxiety'<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;for Alzheimer's patients.<br />
<br />
So, what is it about labyrinths that makes their appeal so universal? Well &#x2026;<br />

<h3 id="orgc07b126">Stoicism</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc07b126">
<p class="verse">
Ancient philosophy is not just about talking or lecturing,<br />
&#xa0;or even reading long, dense books.<br />
In fact, it is something people have used throughout history<br />
&#xa0;– to solve their problems<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and to achieve their greatest triumphs.<br />
<br />
Specifically, I am referring to Stoicism,<br />
&#xa0;which, in my opinion, is the most practical of all philosophies<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and therefore the most appealing.<br />
Stoicism was founded in Ancient Greece by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC,<br />
&#xa0;but was practised by the likes of Epictetus, Cato, Seneca and Marcus Aurelius.<br />
Amazingly, we still have access to these ideas,<br />
&#xa0;despite the fact that the most famous Stoics never wrote anything down for publication.<br />
Cato definitely didn’t.<br />
Marcus Aurelius never intended his Meditations to be anything but personal.<br />
Seneca’s letters were, well,<br />
&#xa0;letters and Epictetus’ thoughts come to us by way of a note-taking student.<br />
<br />
Stoic principles were based on the idea<br />
&#xa0;that its followers could have an unshakable happiness in this life<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and the key to achieving this was virtue.<br />
The road to virtue, in turn, lay in understanding<br />
&#xa0;that destructive emotions, like anger and jealousy, are under our conscious control<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;– they don’t have to control us,<br />
&#xa0;because we can learn to control them.<br />
In the words of Epictetus:<br />
&#xa0;“external events I cannot control,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;but the choices I make with regard to them.<br />
&#xa0;I do control”.<br />
<br />
The modern day philosopher and writer Nassim Nicholas Taleb defines a Stoic as someone<br />
&#xa0;who has a different perspective on experiences<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;which most of us would see as wholly negative;<br />
&#xa0;a Stoic “transforms fear into caution,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;pain into transformation,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;mistakes into initiation and desire into undertaking”.<br />
Using this definition as a model,<br />
&#xa0;we can see that throughout the centuries Stoicism has been practised in more recent history<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;by kings, presidents, artists, writers and entrepreneurs.<br />
<br />
The founding fathers of the United States were inspired by the philosophy.<br />
George Washington was introduced to Stoicism by his neighbours at age seventeen,<br />
&#xa0;and later, put on a play based on the life of Cato to inspire his men.<br />
Thomas Jefferson kept a copy of Seneca beside his bed.<br />
<br />
Writers and artists have also been inspired by the stoics.<br />
Eugène Delacroix, the renowned French Romantic artist<br />
&#xa0;(known best for his painting Liberty Leading the People) was an ardent Stoic,<br />
&#xa0;referring to it as his “consoling religion”.<br />
<br />
The economist Adam Smith’s theories on capitalism were significantly influenced by the Stoicism<br />
&#xa0;that he studied as a schoolboy,<br />
&#xa0;under a teacher who had translated Marcus Aurelius works.<br />
<br />
Today’s political leaders are no different,<br />
&#xa0;with many finding their inspiration from the ancient texts.<br />
Former US president Bill Clinton rereads Marcus Aurelius every single year,<br />
&#xa0;and many have compared former President Obama’s calm leadership style to that of Cato.<br />
Wen Jiabao the former prime minister of China,<br />
&#xa0;claims that Meditations is one of two books he travels with<br />
&#xa0;and that he has read it more than one hundred times over the course of his life.<br />
<br />
Stoicism had a profound influence on Albert Ellis,<br />
&#xa0;who invented Cognitive Behaviour Therapy,<br />
&#xa0;which is used to help people manage their problems<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;by changing the way that they think and behave.<br />
It’s most commonly used to treat depression.<br />
The idea is that we can take control of our lives<br />
&#xa0;by challenging the irrational beliefs<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that create our faulty thinking, symptoms and behaviours by using logic instead.<br />
<br />
Stoicism has also become popular in the world of business.<br />
Stoic principles can build the resilience and state of mind<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;required to overcome setbacks<br />
&#xa0;because Stoics teach turning obstacles into opportunity.<br />
A lesson every business entrepreneur needs to learn.<br />
<br />
I would argue that studying Stoicism is as relevant today<br />
&#xa0;as it was 2,000 years ago,<br />
&#xa0;thanks to its brilliant insights into how to lead a good life.<br />
At the very root of the thinking, there is a very simple way of living<br />
&#xa0;- control what you can and accept what you can’t.<br />
This is not as easy as it sounds<br />
&#xa0;and will require considerable practice<br />
&#xa0;– it can take a lifetime to master.<br />
The Stoics also believed the most important foundation<br />
&#xa0;for a good and happy life is not money, fame, power or pleasure,<br />
&#xa0;but having a disciplined and principled character<br />
&#xa0;– something which seems to resonate with many people today.<br />
