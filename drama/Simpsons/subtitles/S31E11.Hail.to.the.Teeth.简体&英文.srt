00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,080
十一点即将播出  什么都没有
Coming up at 11:00: nothing.

163
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,510
侯默  这是个单身派对
Now, Homer, as this is a bachelor party,

164
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,100
我想给你看点东西
I want to show you something.

165
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,780
但别跟妻子们说
But, uh, no word to the wives.

166
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,680
话说你是怎么认识你妻子的
How did you meet your wife, by the way?

167
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,820
很普通  男孩遇上女孩  女孩遇上银行账户
Usual: boy meets girl, girl meets bank account.

168
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,690
现在闭上眼睛
Now, shut your eyes.

169
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,520
你从未见过如此诱人的胴体
You've never seen a body this enticing.

170
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,280
正如我所想
Exactly what I imagined!

171
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,090
食物昏迷  他会没事的
Food coma. He'll be fine.

172
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,090
{\an8}饱餐一顿后感到昏昏欲睡

173
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,050
你好  女朋友
Hey, girlfriend!

174
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,870
谁  我吗
Uh, who, me?

175
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,810
丽莎  你去做了眉毛脱毛吗
Lisa, did you get your eyebrows waxed?

176
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,590
你看起来真棒
You look amazing!

177
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,180
我没有眉毛
I don't have eyebrows.

178
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,780
看看我这对毛毛虫
Well, check out these twin caterpillars.

179
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,730
怎么回事
What's going on?

180
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,290
她的笑容让我感到饱足
Her smile makes me feel full,

181
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,600
就像我昨晚真的吃了晚饭一样
like I actually ate dinner last night.

182
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,590
如果你从不吃饭  你怎么还这么胖
If you never eat, how come you're so fat?

183
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,870
美国人可以胖并贫穷着
Americans can be fat and poor.

184
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,820
正是这一点让我们如此强大
That's what makes us so great.

185
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:03,310
{\an8}《夏洛的网》

186
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,090
就这样  在救了威尔伯后
And so, after saving Wilbur,

187
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,360
夏洛爬着爬着  死去了
Charlotte crawled off to die,

188
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,010
就像秋天时所有谷仓里的蜘蛛一样
as all barn spiders do in the fall.

189
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,590
很精彩  丽莎
Bravo, Lisa.

190
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,410
给我们这节课画上了愉快的句号
What a positive note on which to end the class.

191
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,120
愉快  愉快吗
Positive? Positive?

192
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,010
夏洛在地球上最悲伤的地方独自死去了
Charlotte died alone at the saddest place on Earth,

193
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,210
在一个空荡荡的露天游乐场中
an empty fairground.

194
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:26,270
你的微笑让独自死去变得有趣了
Well, your smiling face made dying alone fun.

195
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,950
相信我  我就是这么打算的
And believe me, that's where I'm headed.

196
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,660
所以只要我在微笑
So as long as I'm smiling,

197
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,130
从我口中说出什么样的话都不重要吗
it doesn't matter what comes out of my mouth?

198
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,690
从鼻子中也是
Or your nose.

199
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,080
我不再需要这些了
I don't need these anymore.

200
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,000
{\an8}舍曲林[抗抑郁药物]

201
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,240
这个可以加到威利的炖菜里
This'll go good in Willie's stew.

202
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,000
人们真的这么肤浅吗
Can it really be that people are this shallow?

203
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,590
丽莎  丽莎  丽莎
Lisa! Lisa! Lisa!

204
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,780
而且我有肤浅到乐在其中吗
And am I shallow enough to enjoy this?

205
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,620
的确如此
I am!

206
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,140
我太开心了  我可以唱歌
I'm so happy, I could sing!

207
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,790
*你好  世界*
*Hello, world!*

208
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,360
撑得我好疼
That really hurts with the braces.

209
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,270
-选一个吧  -这是什么
- Take your pick. - What is it?

210
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,020
不知道  上面写的是西班牙语
No idea. The labels are in Spanish.

211
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,150
{\an8}春田小学

212
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,070
-你好  美女  -你好  巴仔
- Hey, gorgeous. - Hey, Bart.

213
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,090
丽莎  恶心死了  我不知道是你
Lisa? Oh, yuck! I didn't know that was you.

214
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,110
微笑让人们完全改变了对我的看法
It's the smile. It's totally changed how people see me.

215
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,340
我只是想让你知道  你一直都让我恶心
Well, I just want you to know, you'll always be gross to me.

216
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,370
谢天谢地  我一直有个疑问
Oh, thank God. I was having doubts,

217
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,510
想弄清楚这是不是性别歧视
trying to figure out if this is sexist.

218
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,440
谢天谢地我找到了这个
And then I found this.

219
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,270
{\an8}不要给学生看也不要扔掉

{\an8}女性职场指南

221
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,340
自从避孕药发明之后
It seems like ever since the pill,

222
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,120
职场里好像到处都是单身女性
the workplace has been full of single women.

223
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,930
给你咖啡  吉姆
Here's your coffee, Jim.

224
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,680
多糖  就像你喜欢的一样
Extra sugar, just how you like it.

225
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,570
我要去离婚了
Hmm. Remind me to get a divorce.

226
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,810
但是一些女性在"融合"的过程中有困难
But some women are having trouble "Fitting in."

227
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,070
我一直都搞不明白  吉姆
Well, I can't figure it out, Jim.

228
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,270
我准备了一场大型的演讲
I was all prepared for a big presentation,

229
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:13,070
就像修女站在舞厅里
but it went over like a nun at a go-go bar.

230
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,940
你有一件事没有准备好
Well, there's one thing you didn't prepare,

231
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,300
就是你的脸
and that's your face.

232
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,770
但是我都用了玫琳凯的化妆品
But I'm wearing a pound of Mary Kay.

233
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:21,090
让我接触你的身体告诉你问题所在
Let me touch your body and show you the problem.

234
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,460
没问题
No need to ask.

235
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,630
在你的脸上
You've got a secret weapon

236
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,750
藏着一个秘密武器
sitting in the middle of your face.

237
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,050
你现在肯定获得提拔了
Now you're sure to get that promotion.

238
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,020
真的吗
Really?

239
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,040
不会
No.

240
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,110
你不知道我为什么很讨厌这件事吗
Ugh! Don't you see why I hate this?

241
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,540
因为你厌恶一切
'Cause you hate everything?

242
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,790
因为这让那个讨厌的老家伙听起来很正确
Because it makes that jerky old guy right!

243
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,520
我受到欢迎就是因为我会微笑
I am more popular ‭because I'm smiling.

244
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,790
就是这样
Told ya!

245
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,190
没有一张照片是阿蒂的
Wow. Not a single picture of Artie.

246
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:58,990
{\an8}欢迎来到齐夫的婚礼

247
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,080
也许他已经成熟了
Maybe he has matured.

248
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,030
{\an8}对自己很满意

249
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,710
来到这里感觉就像结束了人生的一个阶段
Well, I guess being here sort of ends a chapter in life.

250
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,300
这值得庆祝
So, lehayim.

251
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,860
好奇怪
That's odd.

252
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,650
新娘的家人都没来
Not one person from the bride's family.

253
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,340
打扰一下  我们需要人去陪新娘走红毯
Excuse me. We need someone walk with bride down the aisle.

254
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,100
你可以吗
Could you?

255
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,720
你先告诉我这个过道有多长
First, tell me one thing: how long is the aisle?

256
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,190
大约二十英尺
About 20 feet.

257
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,500
好吧  我去
All right, I'll do it.

258
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,360
但是我要双份蛋糕
But double cake.

259
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,070
她们这么快就长大了
They grow up so fast.

260
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,100
我知道这一天总会来的
I knew this day would come.

261
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,990
你永远是我的小宝贝
You'll always be my little girl. Mm.

262
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,880
如果他敢伤害我的孩子  我会杀了他
If he hurts my baby, I'll kill him.

263
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:46,000
你也入戏太深了吧
Oh, for crying out loud.

264
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,130
朋友们  家人们
Friends, family,

265
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,300
非常高兴的告诉大家
I take great delight in informing you

266
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,950
新郎和新娘已经写下了他们的誓言
that the bride and groom have written their own vows.

267
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,770
跟着剧本走  伙计们
Stick to the script, amateurs!

268
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,140
我的天
Oh my god!

269
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,590
这太奇怪了
This is too weird.

270
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,030
阿蒂  你是我见过最好的爱人
Artie, you're the greatest lover ever,

271
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,870
当我们滚床单的时候感觉非常棒
when we made sex is so-so good.

272
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,270
我受不了了
I can't take this anymore.

273
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,510
我们快离开这里
We're getting out of here.

274
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,020
没错  这里太诡异了
Yeah. This is really creepy.

275
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,690
连犀牛都走了
Even the rhino's leaving.

276
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,980
你现在可以亲吻新娘了
You may now kiss the bride!

277
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,980
这幅画画的是婚礼上的我们
And this is a picture of us at our wedding.

278
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,440
你特别开心
You're so happy.

279
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,130
这是我们在度蜜月
And here's us on our honey moon.

280
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:34,730
在俄亥俄两天  在密歇根两天  然后
Two days in Ohio, and two days in Michigan, and boo-yah!

281

282
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:39,000
再去安大略感受一些异国风情
To Ontario for some international flavor!

283
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,020
我不开心
I'm not happy.

284
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:44,000
我还画了一张你在密歇根说这句话的画呢
I have a drawing of you saying that in Michigan.

285
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,770
这个笑容很有问题
This smile is so wrong.

286
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,410
没有什么值得开心的事
There's nothing to be happy about.

287
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,430
世界一团糟  学校也是
The world's a mess, and so is this school.

288
00:12:51,180 --> 00:13:01,130
{\an8}可回收

289
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,400
你看  这有多难吗
I mean, how hard is this?

290
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,340
一个开心的姑娘把那个东西放进了洞里
A happy girl put the thing in the hole.

291
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,850
等等  我可以用我的新能力去改变这些
Wait a minute, I could use my new power to change these things.

292
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,540
用它造福一方
Use it for good!

293
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,610
{\an8}春田小学禅意花园

294

毫无疑问
Indubitably.

297

说得好  说得好
Hear, hear! Hear, hear!

298
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,900
我可以让这些成为现实
I can make it happen.

299
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:28,520
快点啊
Hurry!

300
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,480

{\an8}丽莎
忠实  诚信  学识渊博  笑容迷人

303
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,570
你们这些假惺惺的人
You posers.

304
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,990
在它流行起来之前我就支持丽莎了
I was for Lisa before it was cool.

305
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,520
你从没喜欢过丽莎
You never liked Lisa.

306
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,300
什么  这你不能忘了吧
What? You got to remember that.

307
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,190
这是我最大的特点啊
That's my one thing!

308
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:48,240
不  你的特点是挨打之后会哭
No. Your thing is crying you're punched.

309
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,460
那就试试吧
Prove it.

310
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:54,620
你把它搞得都不好玩了
Aw, you're taking all the fun out of it.

311
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,720
民调结果出来了  你的结果不错
The polls are in, and you're doing great.

312
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,520
你抓住了不喜欢苗浩斯的姑娘们的心
You're picking up the key group: girls who don't like Milhouse.

313
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,880
你在秋千摇摆选民那里反响不错
You're big with swing voters,

314
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,790
但跷跷板浮动选民那边可能时上时下
but the teeter-totters could go either way.

315
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,370
滑梯上的那些呢
What about the kids on the slide?

316
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:05,470
他们有上有下的
Eh, they're up and down,

317
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,500
但攀爬架上那边在直线攀升
but the kids on the monkey bars are climbing.

318
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,450
我知道的就这些
That's all I got.

319
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,800
和所有只剩一周的选举一样
Like every election with one week to go,

320
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,310
我们已经把它拿下了
this is in the bag.

321
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,380
别这么早下定论
Don't be so sure.

322
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,560
我的对手很强
I'm up against a tough opponent:

323
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,100
达不溜·斯帕科勒
Dubya Spuckler.

324
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,300
{\an8}佬自要参选

325
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,890
你看看他做的这个负面广告
Look at this negative ad he did.

326
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,790
丽莎·辛普森说"鞋作"的"鞋"读三声
Lisa Simpson says "Writin'" ends with a "G"

327
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,140
还说"酸术"的"酸"读四声
and "'rithmetic" starts with a "A."

328
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,900
但你知道我要说什么吗
You know what I say?

329
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,480
别担心  保持微笑就好
Don't worry. You just keep smiling.

330
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,160
我预约了明天去看牙医
Well, I do have an orthodontist appointment tomorrow

331
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,100
去做个微调
for a tune-up.

332
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,640
胜券在握  主席女士
In the bag, Madam President.

333
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,440
停  先别那么肯定
Bup, don't be so sure.

334
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,280
你看  我画了一张你的就职典礼
Hey, I drew a picture of your inauguration.

335
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,480
我觉得这是我最快乐的时候了
I don't think I've ever looked more radiant.

336
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:47,890
{\an8}科兹卢矫正

337
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,770
好了孩子  你下牙的牙套戴好了
Okay, kid. Your bottom braces are on.

338
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,980
我的微笑呢
What happened to my smile?

339
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,690
不不不  坏大事了
No, no, no, this is terrible.

340
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,490
我表里如一了
I look like I actually feel.

341
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,820
六个月后  你会有一口好牙
In six months, you'll have perfect teeth.

342
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,870
六个月  我现在就得笑
Six months? I have to smile now.

343
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,750
不  我能对抗它
No, I can power through this.

344
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,540
拉尔夫的牙齿保持器丢垃圾桶了
Uh, Ralph lost his retainer in the trash.

345
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,150
有什么办法吗
What can we, uh, do here?

346
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,110
一副五百
New ones a $500.

347
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,150
所以秘密任务是什么  警长
Uh, so just what is this secret mission, Chief?

348
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:25,260
{\an8}正前方死亡垃圾岛

349
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,140
这么说吧  你们被雇用了
Well, let's just say you're on retainer.

350
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:37,080
-我想想  拿这个  -你别拿了
-Let's see. I'll take this. -Aw, stop that.

351
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,080
马姬  这迷你吧咱掏过钱的
Aw, come on, Marge. This minibar is paid for.

352
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:43,070
你知道这三角巧克力的市价吗
Do you know the street value of this Toblerone?

353
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,390
侯默  别拿了行吗
Homer, stop it.

354
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:48,010
我总不由自主想起那可怜的女人
I can't help thinking about that poor woman.

355
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:51,360
阿蒂娶她只因为她长得像我
Artie only married her because she looks like me.

356
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,970
非常像
I mean, a lot like me.

357
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,150
没错  我们得去找她  告诉她
You're right. We have to find her and tell her.

358
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,520
但首先  我想对这床干点
But, first, there's something naughty

359
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,350
淘气的事
I want to do with this bed.

360
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,710
我们来这合适吗
Are you sure we should be here?

361
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,600
严格地说  今天是人家的蜜月
This is technically his honeymoon.

362
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:16,840
阿蒂
Artie?

363
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,590
我正处在人生最低谷
I'm at the lowest point of my life!

364
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,880
但请进吧
But come on in.

365
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,730
同为女人  我想跟你妻子坦白
As a woman, I just want to tell your wife

366
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,640
发生了的事
what's really going on here.

367
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,350
太好了
Sure, why not?

368
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,480
冲她脸说
Say it to her face!

369
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,980
现在你知道我的秘密了
Now you know my secret.

370
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,670
我花费多年时间企图为自己做一个
I've spent years trying to build the perfect copy

371
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,740
完美唯一的女人  就是你  马姬
of the only woman for me: you, Marge.

372
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,630
但她们或多或少都有缺陷
But they were all inferior in somy.

373
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,930
她缺善良
This one lacks kindness.

374
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,660
她想杀我
This one keeps trying to kill me.

375
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,550
她的头是烤面包机
This one's head is a toaster!

376
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,390
而且连百吉饼都塞不下
And the slots aren't even big enough for a bagel!

377
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,530
你为什么要娶一台机器
Why would you marry a machine?

378
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,000
我不想
I didn't.

379
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,660
我只是走投无路
It was one last trick.

380
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,820
我认为你看到咱俩在一起有多配时
I thought when you saw how perfect we look together,

381
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,470
你会意识到我们天生一对
you would realize that we were meant to be.

382
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,960
像诗里说的那样  我就是个愚蠢的笨蛋
I am, as the poet once said, a dumb schmuck.

383
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,600
-阿蒂  -在
- Artie. - Yes?

384
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,430
你不傻  你很聪明
You're not dumb. You're smart.

385
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,250
我认为这些疯狂实验里
And I think this crazy project

386
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,350
有你独特的闪光处
actually had some brilliance in it.

387
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:19,970
想想实验用对了路子会怎么样
Imagine if you use that noodle for good.

388
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,290
哇
Wow. Wow.

389
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:26,740
只有你能读懂我像牡蛎里珍珠般的珍贵
Only you could find a pearl in the flabby oyster that is me.

390
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,970
我会变成更好的人
I will become a better human being.

391
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,170
真不错
Terrific.

392
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:32,290
然后你就会爱我吗
And then you'll love me?

393
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,640
当然不会
No.

394
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,940
好吧  我终于要放弃了
Well, then, I finally give up.

395
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,480
我放弃了吗
Or do I?

396
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:42,090
他妈的
Aw, damn it.

397
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:46,240
阿蒂  你和你的蓝色马姬小队
Artie, you and your blue crew of Margekateers

398
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,240
{\an8}阿蒂·齐夫孤儿院

399
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,980
做了这么多善事
have done so many good deeds.

400
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,390
接下来有何计划
What's next?

401
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,290
我会娶她们其中一个
I'm gonna make one of them my bride.

402
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,320
嘿  我没给你们装翅膀啊
Hey, I didn't give you wings.

403
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,870
出路要靠自己找
Life finds a way!

404
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,670
{\an8}学生会竞选辩论
败者留校查看

405
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,680
同学们  安静下来
Uh, let's quiet down, please.

406
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,100
这场辩论早点结束
The sooner we can get this debate over,

407
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,050
老师们就能早点吃上冰淇淋
the sooner the teachers can get ice cream.

409
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,020
西摩不能吃  他有胃病
None for Seymour. He gets gassy.

410
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,640
是的  我知道
Yeah I-I know.

411
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,690
下面有请特邀辩论主持人
And now we have a very special moderator,

412
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,060
玛丽·贝莉州长
Governor Mary Bailey.

413
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:18,550
第一位候选人是达不溜·斯帕科勒
Our first candidate is Dubya Spuckler.

414
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,070
达不溜  达不溜
Dubya! Dubya!

415
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,320
这是你哥哥
That's your brother.

416
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,250
他更愿意被称为"他们"
He prefers the pronoun "They,"

417
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,570
因为在我的子宫里他吃掉了自己的双胞胎兄弟
on account of the twin he absorbed in my belly.

418
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,500
另一位候选人因病只能用视频通话的方式参加
Our other candidate is ill, so she'll be Skyping in.

419
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,820
丽莎·辛普森
Lisa Simpson.

420
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,430
丽莎  很遗憾你病了  你有什么症状
Lisa, I'm sorry, what do you have?

421
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:37,280
我有的是对学校的一腔热血
What I have is an agenda for this school

422
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,390
和一颗勇往直前的心
an agenda that looks forward.

423
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:42,140
我是个结果导向的人  而我的对手
I can deliver results, while my opponent

424
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,570
连结果两个字都不会写
can't even spell "Results."

425
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,710
我当然会
Yes, I can. R-E squiggly letter,

426
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,270
姐姐的"姐"
buet letter, tall man,

427
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,240
还有苹果树的"果"
little plus sign, squiggly letter.

428
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,200
"姐果"
"Results."

429
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:54,030
根本就不对
That's not how you spell "Results."

430
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,740
丽莎听起来根本没生病
Lisa doesn't sound sick at all.

431
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,870
你说你以前做过这个
You said you've done this before.

432
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,200
我想表现的爷们一点才那么说的
It was my machismo talking.

433
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,830
丽莎在用鬼脸软件
Lisa's using a funny-face app.

434
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,240
听着  我试图愚弄大家  是我做错了
Listen, I tried to fool you, and that was wrong.

435
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,380
令人作呕
This is an abomination!

436
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,330
你来学校辩论会干嘛
What are you doing at a school debate?

437
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,320
我的私生子是这里的学生
My illegitimate son goes here.

438
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,910
真丢人
Oh, the shame.

439
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,980
我还有很多好想法
I still have good ideas.

440
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,610
在我听来全是废话
All I hear is "Nag, nag, nag."

441
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:37,060
达不溜  达不溜
Dubya! Dubya!

442
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,710
达不溜  达不溜
Dubya! Dubya!

443
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,300
全完了
Oh, boy.

444
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,800
我不想承认大家喜欢我
I didn't want to believe my popularity was

445
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,170
是因为我的笑容
based on my stupid smile.

446
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,310
但事实如此
Oh, but it was.

447
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,520
你还是个孩子  而且时代在改变
You're just a kid, and things are changing.

448
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,540
也许未来社会评价女人的标准
In the future, women will be judged

449
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,790
不再是根据容貌  而是根据内在
by what they say, not how they look.

450
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:59,910
也许吧  但这个未来真的很远
Maybe, but the future is a really long way away.

451
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,080
告诉过你应该多笑一笑的
Told you you should smile more.

452
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,730
未来已经到来了
The future is now!

453
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:13,720
请举杯  我终于将你们改造完美了
A toast. I have finally perfected you.

454
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,750
你们的容貌都和马姬一样  而且永远不会离开
You all look just like Marge, and you will never leave.

455
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,870
有哪个幸运女孩想和阿提一起派对
Now, which of you lucky girls wants to party with Arty?

456
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:25,550
我正处于省电模式
I am in power save mode.

457
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,960
好吧  那你们俩呢
Oh, fine. What about you two?

458
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,320
省电模式
Power save.

459
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,720
剩余电量不足
One percent battery.

460
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,690
我只是不喜欢你罢了
I just don't like you.

461
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,750
这算间接接吻
Oh! That counts as a kiss.
