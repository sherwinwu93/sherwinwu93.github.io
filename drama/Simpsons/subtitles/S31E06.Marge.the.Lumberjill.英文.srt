18
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,810
What, too soon?

19
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,600
Avast there.

20
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,160
It be too late to alter course, matey.

21
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,040
And there be pirates lurking in every cove.

22
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,280
Get to the ride.

23
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,070
Did they get a picture?

24
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,260
Welcome to our first-ever night of dramatic scenes

25
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,140
written by our students.

26
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,480
Should we silence our cell phones and pagers?

27
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,060
No, no, no, please, I beg you, leave them on.

28
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,340
An-And here-here's some candy to unwrap.

29
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:24,270
And now, an new scene from the CW's Riverdale.

30
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,160
Jughead, there's been a murder at Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe

31
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,450
and it's up to us kids to solve it.

32
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,500
I can't deal with that right now.

33
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,250
My dad's in jail and the only way to get him out

34
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,830
is to try drugs.

35
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,950
We're both pregnant with Big Moose's babies.

37
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,220
Wait. So this is a play based on a YouTube

38
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,580
of kids playing a video game?

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,920
- That's right. - It's about time.

40
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,770
Okay, to get their chug jugs,

41
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,020
I could snipe these guys out one by one,

42
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,060
but the smarter move is to plant a charge

43
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,810
at the base of their attack platform

44
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,730
and skull-splat 'em when they land.

45
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,980
Hey, guys, if you want more game hacks like this,

46
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,950
be sure to smash our like button and subscribe to our channel.

48
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,530
Up next, night vision fails.

49
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,860
How is this a play?

50
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,490
Well, sir, video game walk-throughs

51
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,330
are the only narrative most of these kids have been exposed to.

52
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,700
- This is their Becket. - Who?

54
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,130
Are you Terry Bradshaw?

55
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:24,050
No. It's, uh, Donny Osmond.

56
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,380
Boner. Boner from Growing Pains.

57
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,250
You're all wrong. My real identity is...

58
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,170
Flavor Flav!

59
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,600
Flavor Flav? I've heard of you.

60
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,520
I've heard of you so much.

61
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,940
I am such a huge fan of your movies, books, or music.

62
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,380
I can also pretend to be impressed.

63
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,890
The end.

64
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,530
Wake up. Lisa's next.

65
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,700
Oh, no, please. I'm having the best dream.

66
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,620
I was in my warm, cozy grave.

67
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,080
Well, I'm gonna dream about me in a soft, cuddly crypt.

68
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,460
Amazingly, this next piece is not based on something

69
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,300
you watch on your phone or a gas pump,

70
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,300
but is actually an honest-to-goodness play,

71
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,910
by Lisa "Thank God You're a Throwback" Simpson.

72
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,460
And so I give you

73
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,250
Long Day's Journey Into Light Beer.

74
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,760
Where's my beer, Marjorie?

75
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:19,630
I spent all day making sure this beer was cold.

76
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,470
Aah! I make bad choices.

77
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,720
Lisa's really nailed the Hibberts.

78
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,320
Uh, yo, dude, my catchphrases

79
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,200
are as outdated as my slingshot.

80
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,650
Ay, caramba!

81
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,870
Oh, Mom, it's so hard being a straight-A student

82
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,250
with a social conscience who writes amazing plays.

83
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,630
The only stable thing in this house is you,

84
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,200
making every day the same as the last.

85
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,090
Exactly the same.

86
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,130
Like the coffee maker says,

87
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,840
things will perk up.

88
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,140
I thought you were the coffee maker.

89
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,390
You can learn a lot from percolators.

90
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:58,170
Make the most of the daily grind.

91
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,100
The mother character is such a snooze.

92
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,470
Ralph has nothing to play against.

93
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,260
They think I'm boring.

94
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,430
This play is about us!

95
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,690
Today I decided to be a race car driver,

96
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,740
so I was, then I quit.

97
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,950
I also have exciting news.

98
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,450
I converted four soap slivers

99
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,520
into practically a new bar.

100
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,440
Is this how the world sees me-- as a...

101
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,750
How do the kids say lame these days?

102
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,780
We say lame-o, you lame-o.

103
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,880
Suck, suck. And I felt like the ghost

104
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,590
belonging to the fog.

105
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,090
And the fog was the ghost of the sea.

106
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,580
Suck, suck.

107
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,760
You really think I'm that boring?

108
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,060
Lisa, you made someone feel sad,

109
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,470
which is not what a drama about a family is supposed to do.

110
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,220
Marge, could we get a picture?

111
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,350
Okay.

113
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,950
So all the generations...

114
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,070
Boring. They think I'm boring.

115
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,940
I'll show them who's boring.

116
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,380
Now, this morning, Marge Simpson has insistently volunteered

117
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,610
to read a passage.

118
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,030
She says she's gonna bring her own spin to it.

119
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,970
Now, a reading from John, 18:38,

120
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,590
between Pontius Pilate and Jesus.

121
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,170
Marge! Marge! Marge!

122
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,970
Hey-a Jesus,

123
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,270
what's a matter for you?

124
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,840
You saying youse a king?

125
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,260
He was Roman, that's why I'm doing the accent.

126
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:33,030
Anyhoo, Jesus answered, and I think it might have gone

127
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,640
something like this.

128
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,860
I'm not a king, I'm a carpenter.

129
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,390
A Jewish carpenter.

130
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,230
The only thing I nail are my SATs.

131
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,660
So then, Pontius says to the elders,

132
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,200
"This-a Jesus, he-a look like a nice-a guy."

133
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,830
Nobody talk-a like-a that.

134
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,420
I make a nice-a sentence.

135
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,870
Just like-a Mama used to construct.

136
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,260
Can we just hear Lovejoy's sermon, please?

137
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,830
Yeah, Marge, read the room.

138
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,960
You need this more than we do, lady.

139
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,200
Boring. That's what this straight-A Girl Scout

140
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,100
has become-- boring.

141
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,210
You just had a near-death experience.

142
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,360
That's exciting.

143
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,360
What a rich life you lead, Mom.

144
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,370
I'm going to bed.

145
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,760
That will really turn around your boring reputation.

146
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,570
Don't worry, Homer, I'll chop the wood.

147
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,770
Like always.

148
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,110
I have to do everything.

149
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,440
Even chop the trees.

150
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,590
I know where she can put that chopping to good use.

151
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,470
Homer's neck?

152
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:22,790
No. He doesn't have one. Something better.

153
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,340
Lower your right hand. Gives you more power.

154
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,220
Thanks, um...

155
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,220
Paula. Friend of Patty's.

156
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,900
We met at Burning Woman.

157
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,220
Nice job on that wood.

158
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,240
I helped.

159
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,740
Yeah, you helped, all right.

160
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,930
You helped that hammock kiss the ground.

161
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,990
Marge, I don't know if you know this,

162
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,700
but I'm a top-level contender at Timbersports.

163
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,280
That's so interesting.

164
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,710
How does it feel to be magnificent?

165
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:52,530
I'll show you.

166
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,120
That is a fascinating hobby.

167
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,830
Timbersports is more than a hobby.

168
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,590
It's an unpaid passion that you do in your spare time.

169
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,630
Now, we're going to the woods.

170
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,360
- What are you doing? - Breathing.

171
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,890
Breathing for the first time in my life.

172
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,600
Can I do one thing

173
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,230
for the knots in your shoulders?

174
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,150
Sure.

175
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,230
Not so...

176
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,150
Now, to motivate your chopping,

177
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:38,620
think of things that make you mad.

178
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,340
Oh, nothing really makes me mad.

179
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:44,620
Mom, Lisa won't stay on her side of the thought bubble.

180
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,420
You have five seconds to live.

181
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,590
So do you, idiot. We're in the same bubble.

182
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,300
My final words are Lisa sucks!

183
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,260
She's a natural.

184
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,490
*I walked into the forest*

185
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,770
*So beautiful and green*

186
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,120
*And there I saw a woman*

187
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,940
*Who was chopping down a tree*

188
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,210
*The sawdust was flyin'*

189
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,780
*She was spinnin' on a log*

190
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,380
*On her waist was strapped a tool belt*

191
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,390
*With a Black & Decker saw*

192
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:26,050
*Vroom, vroom, pull the cord*

193
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,580
*Buzz, buzz, just one more*

194
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,130
*Roar, roar, what a thrill*

195
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,810
*With Lumberjill*

196
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,270
*Vroom, vroom, pull the cord*

197
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,800
*Buzz, buzz, just one more*

198
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,350
*Roar, roar, what a thrill*

199
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:45,470
*With Lumberjill*

201
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,710
I'm Chip Bunyan, eh,

202
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:02,630
and welcome to the Springfield Timbersports Pro-Am.

203
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:06,250
I'm here with former NBA analyst Anger Watkins.

204
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,680
Timbersports. Timber sports?

205
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,180
I snap one P.A.'s bra strap,

206
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,430
and this is where I land?

207
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,100
Who is the Lebron of this thing?

209
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,140
No one will tell me.

210
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,840
His name is Matt Cogar.

212
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,720
Is his nickname The Cougar?

213
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,680
No, his nickname is Matt.

214
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,390
Matt isn't a nickname.

215
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,890
It's a name name.

216
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,820
I'd storm out of here right now

217
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,810
if I weren't so terrified of squirrels.

218
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,740
Take my money! Take it!

219
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,950
I'm glad Mom's found a passion,

220
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,780
but I wish she didn't have to kill all those trees.

221
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,830
I read that trees are the cause of global warming.

222
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,170
Where'd you read that?

223
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,740
My new fourth grade science book.

225
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,850
And they're off, displaying lots of forest gumption, eh?

226
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,560
First we have Nelson Muntz.

227
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,880
He's ten years old, but, man, is it a hard ten.

228
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:04,390
Hey. That's my boy.

229
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,350
He gets his pole skills from his mama.

230
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,560
Oh! Marge Simpson takes the lead!

231
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:19,490
No one saw this coming, because no one was watching.

232
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,110
What could possibly be her motivation?

233
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,620
I'm not boring!

234
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,810
You magnificent she-beast.

235
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:41,060
All our sweaty passion and grunting paid off.

236
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,300
Now's the time I should tell you. Paula is gay.

237
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,780
Aw. She made a friend.

238
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,060
You've made me a new woman.

239
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,280
Oh. Should I be concerned?

240
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,820
It's no weirder than that time

241
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,950
our knees touched under the bar.

242
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,520
You still think about that?

243
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,070
Every day.

244
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,670
Aw. I haven't been this happy in a long time.

245
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,990
You were great, but I have a question.

246
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:09,010
Do you want to take it to the next level?

247
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:09,870
What do you mean?

248
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,080
Will you ride the blade with me?

249
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:15,220
You know, help me bow the jagged-toothed fiddle?

250
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,640
I don't understand.

251
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,560
Draw and drag the sequoia widowmaker.

253
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,060
You're gonna have to tell me what you're talking about.

254
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,560
Will you be my partner on the double-ended bucksaw?

255
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,270
You really think that I have what it takes?

256
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,680
I know you do.

257
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,780
But if we do this,

258
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,780
you'll have to train with me for a month, in Portland.

259
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:37,020
A month? Oh, no, I can't leave Homer that long.

261
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,460
Oh. Fantasies can be good?

262
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,250
Good to have you back.

263
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,930
Boy, am I beat.

264
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,070
Homie, I feel like

265
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,110
I'm my very best self in these competitions.

266
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,320
You are, honey.

267
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,320
In a way I could never make you feel or comprehend.

268
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,700
Paula wants me to train with her.

269
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,330
If I do, I'll be gone for a month.

270
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,980
A month? We've never been apart that long.

271
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,750
I miss you when we're separated in a revolving door.

272
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,080
I miss you when I'm putting a sweater over my head.

273
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,710
I miss you when I close my eyes during a sneeze.

274
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,260
I miss you when the clock springs ahead an hour.

275
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,220
We'll never get that time back.

276
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,800
Homer, do you really want me to stay,

277
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,970
knowing how much I need this

278
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,960
to feel good about myself?

279
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,670
Yes, I do.

280
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,420
What? What?

281
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,630
Where you going? She might leave and never come back.

282
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:50,850
Just like the McRib.

290
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,200
Oh. I forgot to unlock the door.

291
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,040
God, how insulting to people.

292
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,510
So nervous about seeing your mother.

293
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,140
Let's just enjoy Portland.

294
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,470
I mean, I can't believe we've never been here before.

295
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:24,100
Indigenous artworks, craft breweries,

296
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,560
independent movie theaters--

297
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,880
and that's just in one coffee shop.

299
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,000
Comic Book Guy?

300
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,110
Yes, I often come here to recharge.

301
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,900
In Portland I'm quirky, rather than objectionable.

302
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,350
Do you sell comic books here?

303
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,160
No. Marijuana. And artisanal salami.

304
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,150
Laced with marijuana.

312
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,540
Stupid Flanders Street.

313
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,370
Okay, this is where your mom is.

314
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,430
Help me get her back.

315
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,040
Please help me get her back.

316
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,960
Ooh. Hello, Nicolas Cage.

317
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,810
Dad, she's gonna know that's not your real hair.

318
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,760
You've got to have a modicum of faith in who you are.

319
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,390
It's a snap.

320
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,390
Cool.

321
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,280
Welcome, new friend,

322
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,650
whoever you are.

323
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,580
Homie!

324
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,190
You're here a day early.

325
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,570
Mom!

326
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,750
Mm. Oh, I've missed you all so much.

327
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,280
How are you guys?

328
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,080
Oh! We were, of course, unraveling.

329
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:40,660
Bart, Lisa, your grampa is taking good care of you.

330
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:41,910
Now where's the baby?

331
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,880
Aw. Good girl.

332
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,550
Um, I like what you're wearing.

333
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,390
Thank you. These are locally-sourced dungarees

334
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,730
and Pendleton flannel.

335
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:55,970
It's what Jill Sobule wore when she played the Crystal Ballroom.

337
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,030
Jill Sobule?

338
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:01,600
Like every other place we go, I love Portland.

339
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,700
So much, I want to leave Springfield

340
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,490
until I find out something bad that makes me realize

341
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,270
that there's no place like home.

342
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:11,500
Now, now, your mother has not settled in here.

343
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,530
Welcome.

344
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,360
These are our pugs: Nike and Swoosh.

352
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,970
Marjorie, could you and I have a word in the backyard?

353
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,840
Don't you see what's happening here?

354
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,730
- You're married. - Yes, I know.

355
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,600
To you.

356
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,860
No, to her. Look around.

357
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,740
You're married in the two most important ways there are:

358
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,190
emotionally and cooking.

359
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,690
Oh. That's ridiculous.

360
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,080
You're fostering pugs.

361
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,490
They remind me of you.

362
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:58,130
But I am upset. I'm finally good at something

363
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,920
and you have to be jealous.

364
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,300
Marge, sweetie, I'm really proud of you.

365
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,840
I'm not jealous or mad.

366
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,590
It's just... when are you coming home?

367
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,210
Tomorrow, after the competition.

368
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,960
Woo-hoo! I win.

369
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,550
Not that I was nervous.

371
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:20,360
Unless we win, in which case,

372
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,820
I might stay and prep for the finals.

373
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,560
Marge, I've backed you in this from day one.

374
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:27,200
No, you haven't. Not a bit.

375
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,350
Then it's too late to start now.

377
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,920
Oh, I'm sitting in a bar

378
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,840
and my wife's in love with a female lumberjack.

379
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,800
Classic Portland. Where are you from?

380
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,960
Springfield.

381
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,450
- Which one? Oregon? - I don't know.

382
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,800
Welcome back to the Grizzly Timbersports

383
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,010
Northwest Championship Finals,

384
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,880
brought to you by no one.

385
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,130
Still looking.

386
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,980
Marge and Paula are in control.

387
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,360
I am falling in love with this sport.

388
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,510
And when I fall, I fall hard.

389
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,010
I'm taking you home with me.

390
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:07,860
Hold the Stella, fella.

391
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:11,450
Carol "Oak" Connor and Rachel "The Pine" Cohen

392
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,020
have taken command.

393
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,070
I can't be silent anymore. Let me through.

394
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,570
Eh. There's plenty of room.

395
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:22,030
Marge, I was a lumber-jerk.

396
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,830
I'm only happy if you're happy.

397
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,790
Our love is like an old tree.

398
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,460
If you cut it down, it grows back stronger.

399
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,390
Um, that's not how trees work.

400
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,090
Well, according to my book, it is.

402
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,090
Yay! All right.

403
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,270
I love this sport!

404
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:45,850
And maybe now I can love my lumberjack son.

405
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,230
Ladies and gentlemen, our grand champion

406
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,020
and winner of a Bass Pro Shops $50 gift card,

407
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,400
Marge Simpson.

408
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,900
All right, champ!

409
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,110
See you in the showers.

410
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:03,320
Congratulations, Paula. You won.

411
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,700
Enjoy the hell out of it...

412
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,720
Homer, what is it that you think that I've won?

413
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,590
With me, Marge is a good woman.

414
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:13,970
With you, Marge is a great woman with two awesome dogs.

415
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,060
I'm not interested in Marge.

416
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,850
I have a wife and a kid.

417
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:18,940
You have a wife?

418
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,020
She's in Tokyo, training for the Olympics.

419
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,520
She dances... with the ribbons?

420
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,720
I don't know what it's called.

421
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,860
So you're not breaking us up?

422
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,910
No. I mean, I'll miss her on the other end of the bucksaw,

423
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:34,310
and I'll really miss that $80 grand prize money,

424
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,160
but she's welcome to come up here

425
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,190
and train any time.

426
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,790
I am so grateful.

427
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,210
I want to do something for you.

428
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,420
If you'd like another kid,

429
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:44,090
I am more than happy to offer up my sperm.

430
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,750
That's very kind, but...

431
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,380
No really, I've always wanted to have a kid

432
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,220
with no responsibilities.

433
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,010
All right. You're in the top three.

434
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:54,930
It's you, the track star or the Harvard professor.

435
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,310
Oh, I get it.

436
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,270
Instead of sperm, would you like semen?

437
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,390
They're the same thing.

438
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:00,920
They are? Uh-oh.

439
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,560
Oh, it still feels weird.

440
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,940
I don't know what to say to her.

441
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,600
I never would've thought of that.

442
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,560
Honey, would you like to come home?

443
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,480
Aw. Okay.

444
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,610
Your daddy loves you, sweetie.

445
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,750
he wants to make sure you're always a strong, confident little lady.

446
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,070
So I went out and got you this!

448
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,970
Aw, her baby head fell out.

450
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:37,210
You'll be getting a visit from the Head Fairy.
