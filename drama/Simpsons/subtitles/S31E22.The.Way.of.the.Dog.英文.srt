19
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,950
Who wants popcorn...

20
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,060
- Yay! - Yay!

21
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,550
...to string and put on the Christmas tree?

22
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,160
Ah, damn it.

23
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,890
Mom, I made an ornament at Sunday school.

24
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,820
Oh, it's so...

25
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,420
sticky.

26
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,020
The Popsicle juice represents Jesus's blood.

27
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,880
That would look so pretty on the back of the tree.

30
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,310
Do not put on tree.

31
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,210
May occasionally do this:

32
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,550
Beep! Beep! Beep!

33
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,250
Ooh, look! An old Santa hat.

34
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,610
You know who would love to wear this?

35
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,500
No one.

36
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,830
The dog!

37
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,350
Quick! Lisa, take a picture.

38
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,730
I don't think he wants to take a picture.

39
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:21,940
Dogs... love...

40
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,730
people clothes.

41
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,830
Did you get a good picture?

42
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,110
I don't think so.

43
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,930
He's afraid of it.

44
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,380
No, he's not.

45
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,800
Darn, we wasted three digital photos.

46
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,890
Ugh. Well, suit yourself, spoilsport.

47
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,490
You're out of the card!

48
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,450
Don't worry, he's not out of the card.

49
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,130
- Can we be out of the card? - Everyone's in the card!

50
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,430
Okay, but not like last year.

52
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,810
*Ah, jingle bell, jingle bell*

53
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,420
*Jingle bell rock, oh*

54
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,180
*Jingle bell rock and jingle bell rock*

56
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,390
*A-rockin' and rockin'*

57
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,980
*And words of the song*

58
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,210
*Looks like I parked on the lawn*

59
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,700
*Oh, giddyap, giddyap*

60
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,750
*Giddyap, let's go*

61
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,350
*There's mistletoe*

62
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,460
*There's kissin' to do*

63
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,830
*And lots to kiss.*

65
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,130
Marge, you're never gonna guess what I got you.

66
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,070
It ate my shorts!

67
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,130
Oh, now that it's happened, it's not so funny.

68
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,940
Homie, we have to talk about the difference

69
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,640
between gifts and household supplies. Hmm?

70
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,430
Oh, my God!

71
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,520
What's all the fu...

72
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:02,600
What the...

73
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,320
That dog better have a good explanation!

74
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,140
I did it.

75
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,440
Hit me with the newspaper.

76
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,470
You know I get my news online.

77
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,540
Guys...

78
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,550
what is Santa's Little Helper doing?

79
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,560
I think something is very wrong with him.

80
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,890
I think maybe we should take him to a dog psychologist.

81
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,580
Dog psychologist, eh?

82
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,290
Get off the couch. Get off.

83
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,520
Get off!

84
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,960
Dad, I know what you're thinking.

85
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,200
It's not that.

87
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,380
Elaine Wolff is giving a free lecture tomorrow night.

88
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,950
She's a legend.

89
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,390
Oh, not tomorrow.

90
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,590
Tomorrow's UFC fight 243.

91
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,610
Why do you care so much about one stupid fight?

92
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,660
'Cause he paid 60 bucks to watch it.

93
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,260
60 bucks to watch a fight?

94
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,720
Actually, 70. I got it in HD.

95
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,200
We don't even have an HDTV.

96
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,820
I wanted the pay-per-view operator to think I was a big shot.

97
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:04,340
He's staring at that smudge... smudge... smudge.

98
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,420
What's wrong with that dog... dog... dog?

99
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,260
I need my pill... pill... pill!

100
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,190
That's three pills!

101
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,710
I love playing Candy Crush.

102
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,580
Dad, I need to tell you something,

103
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,670
but I've come to the sad conclusion

104
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,570
that you have difficulty hearing the female voice.

105
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,290
Aw, I love you, too, honey.

106
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,480
Therefore, I have deputized Bart to speak for me.

107
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,450
How you doin'?

108
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,310
"Father, I believe you're an honorable man."

109
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,700
Really?

110
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,340
Okay.

111
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:53,500
"In times of peril, you, um...

112
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,370
even... event..."

113
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,400
"Eventually."

114
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,800
"...eventually do the right thing,

115
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,260
"But Santa's Little Helper is in crisis,

116
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,170
and 'eventually' may be too late."

117
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,310
Aw. Well said, boy.

118
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,810
And, Lisa, for writing it, you win my highest honor,

119
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,790
a hearty Homer hug. Mm.

120
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,970
Now we party.

121
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,570
Why do you eat candy that way?

122
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,700
- I already brushed my teeth. - Oh.

125
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,280
Good evening.

126
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,560
"The more I spend time with dogs, the more I realize

127
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,400
that I entirely prefer them to people."

128
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,900
No, no, I'm serious.

129
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,180
I really despise you.

130
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,220
Despise us? I... Hey, as the owner of a dog,

131
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,810
a tiger and a dolphin, I am highly offended.

132
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,620
Highly!

133
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,970
Okay, first of all,

134
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:56,170
I hate that you call yourselves "Owners."

135
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,810
You own living beings?

136
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,190
Nice.

137
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,090
Uh, hello?

138
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,940
Clayton, I can't talk right now.

139
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,330
I've left her.

140
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,400
I have left my wife.

141
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,840
What? Really?

142
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:16,420
You and I have loved each other since primary school.

143
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,750
She knew that,

144
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,270
so I think she was relieved.

145
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,810
Oh, Clay.

146
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,200
I'd stopped allowing myself to hope.

147
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,490
But, uh... I think I got to call you right back.

148
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,190
No, no! Stay on the call.

149
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,750
We're invested.

150
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,050
I have to go. I'm giving a lecture.

151
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,280
Wait! Wait!

152
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,110
We're getting married, right?

153
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,870
Yeah, sure, sure, yeah, whatever.

154
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,750
Wait!

155
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,090
Oh. Yes.

156
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,770
You don't deserve dogs!

157
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,690
They sniff out your diseases

158
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:47,060
and comfort you when you ride planes.

159
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:51,700
And I constantly hear: "How do I get my dog to listen?"

160
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,440
- Choke him till he taps out! - Oh, good God!

161
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,790
Always what can your dog do for you.

162
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,210
Never once has somebody asked:

163
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,720
"What is my dog trying to say?"

164
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,810
Bad! Bad!

165
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,750
All of you, bad!

166
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,930
This was the worst extension class I ever took. My God.

167
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,940
It was even worse than flower arranging.

168
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,490
I mean, who can say where baby's breath should go?

170
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,720
Huh. Not I. Tell you that much.

171
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,180
Uh, ma'am...

172
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,000
Down.

173
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,190
It's okay. We're friendly.

174
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:25,290
Ma'am, I know you were once a young,

175
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,510
inquisitive girl like me.

176
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,180
Mm, not like you, no.

177
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,790
I knew when to keep quiet.

178
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,110
Please. My dog is having a breakdown.

179
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,230
So if these tears mean nothing to you...

180
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,700
...help our dog, or let's do this!

181
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,600
Hold my pearls!

182
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,290
Look, I'm sorry,

183
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,710
I just can't d...

184
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,540
Oh, my.

185
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,610
You poor boy.

186
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,700
You've got a story to tell.

187
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,000
Could you teach us to do what you do?

188
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,120
To see the world through his eyes?

189
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,370
Oh, not through his eyes.

190
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,590
That's the point.

191
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:09,770
A dog's dominant sense is smell.

192
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,880
He sees the world with his nose,

193
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,580
and his nose sees so much more than our eyes.

194
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,860
For instance, we see a lamppost.

195
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:24,330
Your dog sees everyone who's ever been here.

197
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,130
Hmm. He really likes you.

198
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,390
He adores me. Knows I can help him.

199
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,030
Wants me to love him back.

200
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,080
But I can't.

201
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,970
A woman can only scoop so much poop.

202
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,740
Stay.

203
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,980
Good stay.

204
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,080
Come on, get to the part that helps us.

206
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,380
I'm trying. In the acknowledgements,

207
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,400
she thanks all 101 dalmatians!

208
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,000
Well, at least I can wash this filthy hat.

209
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,310
Bad dog! Very bad dog!

210
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,570
Crap dog!

211
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,580
Lisa, quick! Get the first aid kit!

212
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,710
But we don't have a first aid kit.

213
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,990
Look under the tree.

214
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,540
Well, if he's staying outside, I'm staying outside.

215
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,160
You are not staying outside!

216
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,700
You are not the boss here!

217
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,350
Well, I am, and he paid me to tell you what to do.

218
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,430
This boy is sleeping outside.

219
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,430
Yes, sir.

220
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,720
- What are we going to do? - No problem, sweetie.

221
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:03,460
There are a lot of dog doctors out there.

224
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,710
Hey. Hello.

225
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,880
Oh, look at this handsome guy.

226
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,430
What's up with you, fella?

227
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,450
Um, he bit my mom.

228
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,620
Oh, I see. Well, we've had a cancellation,

229
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,710
so if you like, we can just put him down right now.

230
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,510
- What?! - No!

231
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:25,200
I-I don't think that's necessary.

232
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,390
Oh, no, I'm afraid once a biter always a biter.

233
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,190
Unless you, like, train 'em or something,

234
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,270
but that's... that's crazy hard.

235
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,130
Would you like a minute to say goodbye?

236
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,010
No way. We're leaving.

237
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,610
And I don't even want to look at you.

238
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:40,140
Hmm. I feel like the Pixar logo.

239
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,640
What are we going to do with the dog?

240
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,090
I guess he's just gonna have to stay in the doghouse

241
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,280
I built for him.

242
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,380
Hey-a, kids. The vet reported your dog as a biter,

243
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,440
so I'm supposed to wait until animal control gets here

244
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,030
to take him away.

245
00:10:59,270 --> 00:10:59,950
What?

246
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,280
So, uh, well, while we wait,

247
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,410
uh, you want to play Simon Says?

248
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,120
Simon says don't kill our dog.

249
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,640
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm Simon.

250
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,260
You're-you're not Simon.

251
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,750
Dad! They're coming for our dog!

252
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,810
I won't let you, you... you big blue balloon.

253
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:20,580
Ooh, I like the image. Hey, imagine me in a parade, huh?

254
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,970
Oh, boy.

255
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:26,600
Oh, darn it.

256
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,020
You call them and tell them

257
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,610
we are not letting you take our dog.

258
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,960
I can't cancel. They're already on the app.

259
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,120
It says they're six minutes away. See?

261
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,480
Oh, they missed a turn.

262
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,850
Oh, now they're doing a U-ey.

263
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:43,510
Geez, hope this guy euthanizes better than he drives.

264
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,500
Dad, quick, take our dog

265
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,520
and drive as far and fast as you can.

266
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,420
Yes, sir.

267
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,830
Oh, God, it's too late.

268
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:53,960
Dr. Wolff?

269
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,820
Look, I need to tell you this one thing.

270
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,000
Something I saw in your dog's eyes.

271
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,290
He's at breaking point, and unless he has

272
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:03,450
some kind of catharsis, something terrible could happen.

273
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,030
He bit my mom.

274
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,710
It is gratifying to be right.

275
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,940
Oh, how awful.

276
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,770
Animal control is coming to get him right now.

277
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:16,480
You can't stop them. They got sticks with wire loops.

278
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,080
Kids, pack his things.

279
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:21,280
And I'll need this. This dog is coming with me.

280
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,570
Well, I am not leaving here empty-handed.

281
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,580
-Make me a sandwich. -No.

282
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,820
Okay, all right.

283
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,980
Being a police chief really sucks.

284
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,240
Here you go.

285
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,730
Listen, I packed you some biscuits.

286
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:40,310
And even though I deplore the killing of all animals,

287
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,320
when you come to the salami, it's from me.

288
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,730
Now who will chase squirrels with me?

289
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,630
You better get going.

290
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,870
Wait. I'm not an emotional guy, but...

291
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,540
Get a doghouse, you two.

293
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,770
Here. Have some Snausage water as you watch this video.

295
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,580
Here at the Institute, there are no bad dogs.

296
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,240
In answer to the age-old question,

297
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,100
"Who's a good dog?"

298
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,070
You are. You are.

299
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,380
Relax in our pile of wet dead leaves

300
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,350
or enjoy fine dining at The Dropped Porkchop.

301
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:35,010
And here's our guarantee to you: no fireworks.

302
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,400
We'll have you feeling better in no time.

303
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,180
Well, uh, there's nothing physically wrong with you,

304
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,440
but to establish trust, I'll sleep in your den tonight.

305
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:50,100
Well, a little bit of, uh, reading before bed?

308
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,850
"Dog having nightmare,

309
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:05,170
perhaps about the root of it all."

310
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,320
Oh, you poor thing.

311
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,420
Have some Lambien. It'll help you sleep.

312
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:50,850
Dad, am I gonna get my dog back?

313
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,860
Of course.

314
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,400
But just in case, I know this isn't the kind of thing

315
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,550
a father says to his son, but let's pray.

316
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,730
Almighty patron saint of dogs, Saint Bernard...

317
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:06,040
- Can I join in? - Sure.

318
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,410
I'll pray, too.

319
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,470
Losing our dog, possibly forever,

320
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,300
has really brought us together.

321
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,600
No!

322
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,420
Sorry, sorry. Back to the prayer.

323
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,030
Okay, now I need to see what set you off.

324
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:22,220
How do you feel about Marge?

325
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,030
She is comfort.

326
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,420
So, what happened?

327
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,030
Elaine? Hello?

328
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,330
The car is here. Tuscany awaits.

329
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,070
Oh, Clay.

330
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:50,040
I should have called.

331
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,100
Darling, I've done something impulsive.

332
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,320
You know how Mother always wanted you to wear her ring,

333
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,470
but she died at a time when we had no hope.

334
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:03,030
And in my heartache, I let them bury her with it.

335
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:07,880
So I dug her up and, uh, will you marry me?

336
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,870
I know "Exhumed"

337
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,470
isn't usually the most romantic word, but...

338
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,360
Oh, Clay. I can't marry you now.

339
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,440
But I can meet you in Tuscany in a few weeks.

340
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,920
I might not be there.

341
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,030
I can't compete with a wagging tail.

342
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,210
Goodbye, Clay.

344
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:29,010
I want you to know I'm already over you.

345
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,210
Oh, no, no, not your fault.

346
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,890
Human nonsense. Let's get back to work.

347
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,860
Today, I want you to interact with the pack.

348
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,010
Mingle. Sniff a butt you don't know.

349
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,500
Okay, interesting.

350
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,060
Let's explore that.

351
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,630
You buried this here. Why?

352
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,250
Is this the key that unlocks your psyche?

353
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,160
Bark once for "Yes," Bark twice

354
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,800
for "That's too simplistic a view of canine psychology."

355
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,710
Oh, hi. Is that our dog?

356
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:25,880
Or one that looks just like it to fool the kids?

357
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,330
You're back!

358
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,210
Where did this come from?

359
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:33,500
Uh, I would have to say the North Pole?

361
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,800
Wait, Dad? That was the hat I was wearing

362
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,480
the night we got Santa's Little Helper, remember?

363
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,000
- Go! Go! Come on, boy! - Go, Santa's Little Helper!

364
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,840
- Run! Run! - Come on! Get that rabbit!

365
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,980
Dog of War coming up fast on the outside...

366
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,920
Aw, can we keep him, Dad? Please?

367
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,020
But he's a loser. He's pathetic.

368
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,940
He's...

369
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,000
a Simpson.

370
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,030
Santa's Little Helper was a racing dog?

371
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,720
Not much of one. Even I could beat him.

372
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,200
Oh, it's all clear now.

373
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,080
Your dog has PTSD.

374
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,880
And he has to confront his abuser,

375
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,780
and he's gonna do it right now.

376
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:10,510
Actually, we're in the middle of a holiday brunch, so...

377
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,250
But I-I'm with you.

378
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,910
Uh, goodbye, everybody.

379
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:17,570
So, how many balls are we allowed of croquembouche?

380
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,380
Let's see if they have HBO GO.

381
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,000
I've wanted to watch Euphoria,

382
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,520
but I'm embarrassed to have it in my viewing history.

384
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,420
Les Moore? Greyhound trainer?

385
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,490
- Yeah, that's me. - Dog abuser!

386
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,040
Can I offer you a drink to throw in my face?

387
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,990
- Yeah, I'd like that. - Yes, I bet you would.

388
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,840
I was being sarcastic, naturally.

389
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,230
Not all trainers are monsters.

390
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:49,670
Yeah, I remember this mutt. Uh, Santa's Little Helper.

391
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,550
Yeah! Hey, what'd you rename him?

392
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,690
- We didn't. - Boy, are you lazy.

393
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,020
He was born to one of the fastest in the business,

394
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,980
She Biscuit. Oh, he was her favorite.

395
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,840
And boy, did he love her.

396
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,640
That's how we learned how fast he was.

397
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,510
So naturally, we took him from his mother forever.

398
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,520
Did you just slap me again?

399
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,480
- That was me. - You cut the line. I want to slap.

400
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,860
Here, Maggie.

401
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:20,380
- There. Now we've all had a turn. - Not quite.

402
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,530
Ow! Okay, I get it.

403
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:26,310
Boy, suddenly, the guy who tortures dogs is the bad guy.

404
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,790
Now what does he want?

405
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,780
Son of a gun.

406
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,090
Where's he going?

407
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,420
To his, uh, to his mother.

408
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:43,570
Oh, I love happy endings.

409
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,340
*Memories*

410
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,700
*Light the corners of my mind*

411
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,110
He'll be all right now.

412
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,010
- Thank you so much. - Oh, you're welcome.

413
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,630
I better be getting home. I've got 20 dogs to walk.

414
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,560
I could, uh, use some help.

415
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,220
Fine.

416
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:34,980
It's so great everyone in this family worked out their issues.
