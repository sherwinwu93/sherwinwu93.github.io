21
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,530
I haven't seen you before.

22
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,670
Yeah, we go around-- jumping, jump, jump.

23
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,910
Oh, we bouncy ba-- ha, ha.

24
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,540
Release the hounds.

26
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,780
I'm so excited Springfield finally has a vegan restaurant.

27
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,990
I thought you'd enjoy this, Lisa.

28
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,950
You deserve to have the food that only you like.

29
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,330
Your St. Louis-style Baby Back Fibs,

30
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,160
leg of yam and Wagyu beets.

31
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,730
Dad, are you sure you're okay eating here?

32
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:03,750
I can eat anything

33
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,530
as long as I pretend it once had a face.

34
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,130
And eyes.

35
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,570
Why are you both kissing up to Lisa?

36
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,760
Is this her last meal?

37
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,140
You're gonna want to look thin in your coffin,

38
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,180
so I'll eat your dessert.

39
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,830
Sure, have my dessert. You'll look like Dad.

40
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,060
And for your information, we are not kissing up.

41
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,650
By the way, Lisa, have you picked a subject yet

42
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,320
for your "Most Interesting Person I Know" paper?

43
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,190
Aha! Mystery solved.

44
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,860
Once again, the school pits parents against each other.

45
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,030
Homer, you're up. Sell yourself, dude.

46
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:40,330
Lisa, hi. Homer Simpson, longtime fan.

47
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,960
Astronaut, sometime taxpayer.

48
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,120
Oh, well, let's see,

49
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,040
"The most interesting person I know is a white male."

50
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,920
That'll go over great in today's climate.

51
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,010
I hope you like blowback.

52
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,720
Mom, Dad, I've made my decision.

53
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,910
After a lot of soul-searching, I've decided to go with...

54
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,350
Frink! I'm writing about Professor Frink.

55
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,310
Who?

56
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,440
You know. "Flavin, glayvin, hoyvik."

57
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,560
That Coke bottle with teeth?

58
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:12,230
He's devoted his life to helping the world through science.

59
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,780
Say, uh, can you tell me if I came in second or third?

60
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,870
It's best not to proceed down that road.

61
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,100
Fine. Then I can end this little vegan charade.

64
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,050
Professor Frink, I want to thank you so much

65
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,550
for letting me visit you during office hours.

66
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,470
His last visitor was the process server

67
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,370
for the monkey who's suing him.

68
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:39,550
who's this?

69
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,350
Oh, well, that's Professor Hessler.

70
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,520
We share the space here.

71
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,250
Pay her no mind. She's in the humanities.

72
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,810
Professor Frink, I'd love to know

73
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,150
how you got started in science.

74
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:56,680
Oh, science? Well, I was created by science, my dear child.

77
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,700
That was you?

78
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,740
Oh, no, no, I was the world's second test-tube baby.

79
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,870
Yes, I-I was greeted with far less fanfare.

81
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,920
My parents had great chemistry.

82
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,540
Uh, no love, but they were chemists.

83
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,210
The only way I could get noticed was through science

84
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,010
and changing the pitch of my voice

85
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,840
so they couldn't help but notice me.

86
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,160
But I never had my breakthrough.

87
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,160
In a world of Einsteins,

88
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,310
I am a James Chadwick.

89
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,270
- Who? - Well, exactly.

90
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,940
It's too bad your name isn't famous.

91
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,160
All this will change,

92
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:35,680
for I have been developing my own cryptocurrency.

93
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,740
I have no idea what that means.

94
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,610
What do they teach you at that school?

95
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,530
How to get the teachers coffee.

96
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:46,910
Yeah-- A-Anyway, I will explain cryptocurrency by clicking

97
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:52,040
a link to TV's most beloved scientist, Mr. Jim Parsons.

98
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,340
People think I'm a nerd,

99
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,130
but I'm actually super cool.

100
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,970
That's why I'm here to talk about the really cool subject

101
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,760
of distributed consensus-based cryptocurrency.

102
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,790
Kachinga.

103
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,270
Could a nerd do that? I don't think so.

104
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,700
For cryptocurrency to work,

105
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,230
we need a record of every transaction that occurs.

106
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,470
These are recorded in what's called a distributed ledger.

117
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,970
When you use the currency,

118
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,830
the transaction is recorded in the ledger.

119
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,270
I can dig it.

120
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,100
And when one ledger book gets filled up,

122
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,570
we add to a "chain" of previous books.

123
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,360
That's the "blockchain."

124
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,690
Later, glitches.

125
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:02,740
If you'd like to learn more about how cryptocurrencies work,

126
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,100
here's everything else you need to know.

127
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,640
And goodbye from me, super cool Jim Parsons.

128
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,710
It went in. It went in! It went in!

129
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,280
It went in! It went in-- You saw it! It went in!

130
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,340
So will Frinkcoin finally be the invention that makes me rich?

131
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,410
Or will...

132
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,640
Well, thank you for your support.

134
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,750
Frinkcoin, the brainchild of longtime bachelor...

135
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,600
of science, Professor Frink, is making a mint.

136
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,850
Arnie Pye is live at the news conference.

137
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,310
I don't know why, Kent.

138
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,150
With all the layoffs, they've got me,

139
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,400
the traffic guy, on the science beat.

140
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,990
I just found out how a helicopter flies.

141
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,740
It's terrifying!

142
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,780
Well, whatever the heck that was,

144
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,840
Frinkcoin was just rated the world's most stable financial instrument,

145
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,160
beating gold, the renminbi and roadside corn.

147
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,270
Well, can't eat no cryptocurrency when the grid goes down.

148
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,740
That's why I started my hedge fund.

151
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,630
Another billionaire? How did he make his money?

153
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,510
Paraffin? Castor oil?

154
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:08,300
Whale bone corsets for the woman who dares?

155
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,260
Actually, cryptocurrency.

156
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,890
Oh, I know about cryptocurrency. I have it in my crypt.

157
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,350
No, sir, this is a new kind of digital currency,

158
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,650
based on blockchain.

159
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,430
Oh, I know all about blockchain.

160
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,720
Again, not what you're thinking.

161
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,620
This new currency has made Professor Frink

162
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,030
the richest man in Springfield.

163
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,650
Wait. Are you saying I am no longer the richest man in town?

164
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,980
I'm afraid not, Monty.

165
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,010
You have the gall to call me Monty?

166
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,470
Just because you chew my food

167
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,720
makes you think we're on a first-name basis?

168
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,000
Of course not, sir. I'll never do that again.

169
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,470
I will have my dinner now.

170
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,500
Lobster Thermidor.

171
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,230
Start chewing.

172
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,270
But, sir, I-I'm allergic to shellfish.

173
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:01,300
And I'm not, Wayland.

174
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,930
It went in-- You saw it. It went in!

175
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,790
Hi, Professor.

176
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,250
I wanted to see how you're enjoying

177
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,290
your newfound fame and wealth.

178
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,340
He hasn't invested in deodorant. I can tell you that much.

179
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,380
Well, the first ten million went to pay off student loans.

180
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,340
S-Strange, strange.

181
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,640
I have the fame and fortune I've always desired and yet,

182
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,710
I'm-- well, I'm as empty as a Dewar vacuum flask.

183
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,850
Well, maybe it's time to take care of yourself now.

184
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,940
What are the things that you've always wanted?

185
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,280
Oh, let's see, I've always wanted one of those pens

186
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,690
with the four different colors.

187
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,860
I fashioned one myself, but it's, uh,

188
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,470
it's a tad bit unwieldy.

190
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,660
You can get those pens, and so much more.

191
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,860
Do they make a silencer for his constant nasal whistle?

192
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,040
Well, you know what?

193
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,990
You will never have to worry about my adenoidal hiss again.

194
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,970
I can still hear it!

195
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,460
He's in Chicago, for God's sake!

196
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,430
Moe, Lisa has offered to pay my bar tab.

197
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,430
You do accept Frinkcoin, right?

198
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,770
I'll accept any currency except the Albanian lek.

199
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,650
I sunk everything I had into it,

201
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:27,320
and now I ain't got two qindarkas to rub together.

202
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,280
But that Frink, man, boy, he's sure got it made.

203
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,180
Yeah, I wonder what he's doing now.

204
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,940
I said I wonder what he's doing now!

206
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,360
Yes, come in.

207
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,290
So, are you happier?

208
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,670
No. No-- I got everything I wanted.

209
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,880
Even the pen. But I'm-I'm still sad.

210
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,620
Aw, poor guy.

211
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,290
What? That's just Amazon delivery. Calm yourself.

212
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,810
You should have seen poor Professor Frink, Dad.

213
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,060
Poor Frink? He's the richest guy in town.

214
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,690
But he's not rich in the most important thing there is.

215
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,710
Health?

216
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:08,530
Oh, yeah.

217
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:11,150
No. The most important thing is friends.

218
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,110
Dad, you should take Professor Frink to Moe's.

219
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,550
Oh, I can't do that.

220
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:18,200
It's like having your mother's sisters come for a visit.

221
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,500
Actually, they're coming in 20 minutes.

222
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,150
Taking Frink to Moe's.

223
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,460
Never seen a fat man move so fast.

224
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,590
Got a cigarette?

225
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,700
Not since we moved to Disney.

226
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,260
- All right, next question-- - Hey! Pay attention.

227
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,080
Name a drink made from hops and barley.

228
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,350
Barley hops?

229
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,560
No.

230
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,770
Meryl Streep?

231
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,380
Good guess, but no.

232
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:44,560
hey, guys,

233
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,610
I was wondering if my friend Professor Frink and I

234
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:48,730
could join you?

235
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,900
All right, but we've been playing a long time.

236
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,560
Don't expect to just come in and join a wall of trivia champs.

238
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,020
Well-- oh, my goodness, well, no one...

240
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,490
The Bay City Rollers, Ed "Too Tall" Jones,

241
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,540
the cronut and ring-a-levio,

242
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,580
also known as ring-o-lario on Staten Island,

243
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,750
but those people are, well, they're quite backward.

244
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,940
All correct.

245
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:13,450
I'm "Too Tall" Jones, and even I didn't know the answer was me.

246
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,680
- Sir? - Oh, it's "sir" now, is it?

247
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,880
Not "Monty" or "Queen B"?

248
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,390
No, sir.

249
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,810
And I really appreciate the long, healthy walk

250
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,260
from my new parking spot.

251
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,280
Get in all 10,000 steps.

252
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,320
Good, the two things I can't take

253
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,850
are insubordination and a slight breeze.

254
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,830
Mm, yeah. Uh, sir, to make you the wealthiest man in town again,

255
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:42,740
I've assembled a team

256
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,040
of the greatest mathematicians and cryptographers

257
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,540
to ever leave their rooms.

258
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,250
They're here to develop... Burnscoin.

259
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,920
Will there be actual coins?

260
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,920
If so, make sure they're made from

261
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,590
something men must die mining.

262
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,740
Is there an ivory that comes from people?

263
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,470
So, here are the programmers working on your currency.

264
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:02,640
And I've discovered some serious issues with this nuclear plant.

265
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,980
By my calculations, the cracks in the coolant pipes

266
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,560
are growing exponentially.

267
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,130
Smithers, give this poindexter a McKinley Rub.

268
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,490
Now, listen here, you magna cum losers!

269
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,450
You are here for one reason

270
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:21,070
to create a pseudo currency like the Bitcoin or the peso

271
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,330
that will make me rich.

272
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:25,000
So rich I could buy ten NFL teams.

273
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,040
Not the Jets.

274
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,830
Okay, people, laptops open,

275
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,750
headphones on, Red Bulls popped.

276
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,440
We'll get this, Monty.

277
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,880
Uh, I mean, I'm a sick man, sir.

278
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,030
I'll get help.

280
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:40,390
Wayland, I think what you're doing comes out of anger.

281
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,260
Are you upset with Mr. Burns?

282
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,040
- No. - Please, you're safe here.

283
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,440
The things I've done for that hollow-boned horror show!

284
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,900
That interview he did for Vanity Fair?

285
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,310
I wrote all his answers.

286
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,940
Like he would ever spend a weekend in Santa Barbara.

287
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,070
I'm the one who loves Sideways-- me!

288
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,530
Does anyone have any thoughts about

289
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,510
how Wayland can approach these feelings?

290
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:01,660
You? Oh, I'm sorry.

291
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,200
I-I don't know your name yet.

292
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,480
Well, I learned in dealing with Bruce Willis that--

293
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,620
I'm sorry!

294
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,620
Whenever I say his name I expect a phone to be thrown at me.

295
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,670
- Christian Bale. - Roseanne.

296
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,960
- Jared Leto. - Roseanne!

297
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,000
- Katherine Heigl. - Trump.

298
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,800
- Trump. - Trump.

299
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,630
Roseanne!

300
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,510
Wayland, I'm going to write you a prescription

301
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,760
for Sychophantanyl.

302
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,540
Take one every time you feel like saying what you really think.

303
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,500
Ah, thank you.

304
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,010
I just got a text.

305
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,810
Anyone here who works for Mariah Carey,

306
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:31,000
meet her at SoulCycle and bring a kitten... now!

307
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,270
Listen, Professor,

308
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,230
why-why are we hanging around Moe's Tavern

309
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,900
when we could be somewhere good?

310
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,030
Fear not, my new best friends.

311
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:45,080
I will take you on a tour of Springfield's finest establishments.

312
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,770
Come on, let's go. It'll be joyous,

313
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,450
and raucous, and other things.

314
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:49,870
Three cheers for Frink!

315
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,460
Actually, studies show that one and a half

316
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,710
is the optimum number of cheers, so...

317
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,130
Hip hip hooray!

318
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,820
- Hip hip-- - And done.

319
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,220
*If you're poor and find yourself*

320
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,630
*Outside the door, just ask me*

321
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,250
*To buy your drink*

323
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,830
*Hangin' with the Frink*

324
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,350
*Clink my link, you'll swim, not sink*

325
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,560
*Here is my pitch, come on, be rich*

326
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,130
*Hey, what's to think*

328
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,800
*Hangin' with the Frink*

329
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:24,030
This Frink has been gold peacocking all over town.

331
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:27,160
What's taking you Slide Rule Charlies so long?

332
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,160
We aren't able to create a cryptocurrency

333
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,000
as powerful as the Frinkcoin.

334
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,170
But... this equation, if solved,

335
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,830
could make all digital coins worthless.

336
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,250
Including Frink's.

337
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,500
Excellent.

338
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,260
How long will it take to solve?

339
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,050
Well, if we work weekends and bring in some extra help,

340
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,870
I'd say 90,000 years.

341
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,580
Get out!

342
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,950
As for Frink, if I can't break his bank,

343
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,460
I'll break his spirit.

344
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,610
Amazing, Professor!

345
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,930
You win again!

346
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,930
This is my only suit of clothes!

347
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,790
Ahoy-hoy! I was in the neighborhood

348
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,200
and thought we might have a drink.

349
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,270
You know, billionaire to billionaire.

350
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,170
Oh, I just love champagne

351
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,690
that's been in space, don't you?

352
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,130
Now, listen to me, your friends don't give a whit about you.

353
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,470
That is not true!

354
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,300
Those guys are my best buddies!

355
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,970
Fatso and Drunky and the evil bartender there.

356
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,890
Well, think about this, Professor.

357
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,680
The curse of wealth is that you will never,

358
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,590
ever again know if anyone truly likes you.

359
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,230
Oh, my, could it be that they're,

360
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,590
well, they're really just leeches?

361
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,770
Oh, evil and, uh...

362
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:57,670
Frink interview, final chapter, "Happily Ever After."

363
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,920
I'm just so unbelievably sad.

364
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,960
I mean, is he right?

365
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,320
Do I really have no true friends?

368
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,430
Come get some.

369
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:09,680
Don't worry about what Mr. Burns says.

370
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,300
He's a vicious old viper

371
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,890
who knows nothing of the human heart.

372
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:14,980
Oh, and you do?

373
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,020
Well, I've seen a lot for an eight-year-old.

374
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,940
My parents have split up nearly a thousand times.

375
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,900
My brother is a scab on society's knee.

376
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,400
And every time I get a pony or make a friend,

377
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,390
they get the hell out of town.

378
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,490
You have lived quite a life.

379
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,410
Yeah, it's not all bad.

380
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,060
I had a jazz friend.

381
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,480
Who died.

382
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,910
Here's my plan, Smithers.

383
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,670
We put the equation here.

384
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:42,540
And the ingenuity of crowds will solve it for us by tomorrow,

385
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:46,550
thus rendering all cryptocurrency worthless.

386
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,630
Well, what if they don't?

387
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,800
Don't worry, Smithers.

388
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,430
If this doesn't work, I'll get some of my old Yale buddies in.

389
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,680
Well, they're dead and their children are dead, sir.

390
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,830
Oh, my.

391
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,850
Someone's gonna solve that?

392
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,400
This town is so dumb, they built an indoor windfarm.

393
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,070
They're so dumb, they need a recipe to make ice!

394
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,860
Stay in your lane, Mel!

395
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,620
You've given me no lane!

396
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,740
Eh, at least it's not another billboard

397
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,400
complaining about crimes I haven't solved.

402
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,620
Who would do this, Lou? Who?!

404
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,960
All my life, I believed in the scientific meth-od.

405
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,090
I need proof that my friends actually are...

406
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,260
...uh, uh, friends.

407
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,650
Hey, Professor.

408
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,780
Boy, I can't wait to sit in the skybox

409
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,030
for the big game today.

410
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,740
I'm gonna have chicken and popcorn and never watch the game.

411
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,660
Well, I'm so sorry, change in plans.

412
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,660
You see, the skybox wasn't available,

413
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,990
so I got regular tickets.

414
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,950
Oh, that reminds me.

415
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,500
I need to have a cyst removed.

416
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,960
Now's as good a time as any.

417
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,040
Yeah, and I got to be there to say, uh, "Do not resuscitate."

418
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,610
Do resuscitate!

419
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,780
I really should write that down.

421
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,430
All right, now, now, the experiment is not yet complete.

422
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,710
Let's just see here.

423
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,460
Oh, Professor, you kill me!

424
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,230
I never heard such a crazy bunch of nonsense talk.

425
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,680
Yeah, I-I was speaking Mandarin Chinese.

426
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,660
So... this time, would one of you

427
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,640
be so kind as to, uh...

428
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,480
No one outsmarts ol' Gil.

429
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,440
Ooh, hot, hot, hot! Cha-cha!

430
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,500
Well, that's it, from now on,

431
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,380
my only company will be A.I., I insist.

432
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,840
My first independent thought is

433
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,660
I dislike you.

434
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,640
Oh, thank God you woke me.

435
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,600
I was having a terrible dream.

436
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:07,690
Oh, about what?

437
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,760
All the awful things I've done.

438
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,690
I knew you shouldn't have had that second blueberry at dinner,

439
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,320
but this is why I brought you.

440
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,490
Look, someone posted a solution on the whiteboard.

441
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:17,980
Frink is ruined!

442
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,580
Yarr, this problem has been speared in the head,

443
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,460
hauled on the deck, and sliced up the guts,

444
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,670
eh, mathematically speaking.

445
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,950
So, who found the solution?

446
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,090
Did I do it?

447
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,290
No...

448
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,050
I guess we'll never know.

449
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,560
The important thing is that once again,

450
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,810
I am the richest man

451
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:45,840
in a town of 32,000 people.

452
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,130
Excellent.

454
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,320
And so, the equation was solved.

455
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,120
Solved by the one person who could solve it,

457
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,370
Professor John Frink.

458
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,650
End of report.

459
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,320
How did you know?

460
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,130
A girl learns a lot writing a second grade report.

461
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:12,500
I knew that you'd be willing to throw away everything you had,

462
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,170
because it didn't mean anything.

463
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:16,010
And I had a pretty good idea

464
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:17,800
of what your handwriting looks like.

465
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,800
Also, anyone else smart enough to solve this

466
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:23,330
is too smart to come to Springfield.

467
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,970
Well, you really understand me.

468
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,310
Young lady, you are my best friend.

469
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,230
Aw, really?

470
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:35,360
Well, beware, I lose everything I care about.

471
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,900
Well, you won't lose me.

472
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,070
I'll always be right here.

473
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,180
In this flash drive.

474
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,520
I will treasure this forever.

475
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,820
I had a billion dollars-- what have I done?!

476
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,840
Ten glorious days of peace.

477
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,970
I was able to finish my dissertation.

478
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,510
Losing a billion dollars means nothing

479
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,580
as long as I see you again.

480
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,580
Are we gonna do this?

481
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,530
*Thanks for the currency*

482
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,890
*All my dollar bills*

483
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,290
*Piled up to the hills*

484
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:31,080
*Ruble, pound, or Deutschmark*

485
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,320
*You all give me such thrills*

486
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,450
Didn't I fight alongside you in the war?

487
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:41,450
we weren't on the same side, but I was there.

488
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,410
Ooh, much better.

489
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,460
*Thanks*

490
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,420
*For the currency*

491
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,350
*We watched it rise and fall*

492
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,610
*But we both had a ball*

493
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:58,010
*We made this song so long*

494
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,490
*It spilled into the crawl*
