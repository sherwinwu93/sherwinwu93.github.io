where the hosts are really just trying to sell Amway.

301
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:11,860
{\an8}安利

302
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,370
我们都很想走出家门
We're all so eager to get out of the house.

303
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,460
不过是为什么呢
But why?

304
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,730
是为了用棍子举着小胡子  站在线内
To stand in line to have your picture taken

305
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:21,360
拍张照片吗
holding a mustache on a stick?

306
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:27,650
这些梦幻的计划都是为了浪漫
And all these magical plans are supposed to lead up to romance.

307
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:30,120
可当你回到家  你觉得疲倦又恶心
But when you get home, you feel tired and gross

308
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,980
觉得自己老到走不动路
and a thousand years old.

309
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,640
于是你为一个又一个夜晚制定计划
So you make plans for another night and another,

310
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,430
这种循环永不停歇  而你唯一触碰
and the cycle continues until the only time

311
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,920
你妻子的时候  就是你没注意她凌晨四点
you touch your wife is when you don't notice

312
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,520
坐在马桶上  而你一屁股坐在了她身上
she's on the toilet at 4:00 A.M. and you sit on her.

313
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,150
我没有毁掉这次航行
I didn't ruin this cruise.

314
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,370
我拯救了你们的生活
I saved your life.

315
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:55,230
现在回家去  不要再制定计划了
Now return to your homes and never make plans again.

316
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,010
那个呆子弄乱了我们的头发
That egghead rando messed with our hair.

317
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,350
我们跟她看起来差不多了
We look like her!

318
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,590
别担心  外面有车等着我们
Don't worry. I have a car waiting.

319
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,070
峰时价格的接机服务
An airport pickup during surge pricing?

320
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:30,320
再见  点阵式打印机  你好  喷墨式打印机
So long, dot matrix printer, hello, bubble jet.

321
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,370
这边
This way.

322
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:42,970
你上吧
You go ahead.

323
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,670
你不是讨厌马
You don't hate horses.

324
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,350
你是怕它们
You're afraid of them.

325
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:51,050
不是  我只是讨厌和警察一起工作的动物
No, I'm not. I-I just hate any animal that works with cops.

326
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,100
动物的性子不该那么烈
No creature should be that jacked.

327
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,710
我害怕的时候你可没让我退缩
You didn't let me quit when I was scared,

328
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,080
所以我要让你见识一下
so I'm gonna help you see

329
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,690
这匹威风的生物有着温柔的灵魂
that this majestic creature has a gentle soul.

330
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:06,410
别站在她身后  她会把你的脸踢掉的
Not behind her! She'll kick your face off!

331
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,990
我们要把你的图享  抖音和外卖软件毁掉
We're gonna destroy you on Insta, TikTok and Postmates.

332
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:38,660
你会成为社交网络的弃儿  还得自提寿司
You'll be a total outcast and you'll have to pick up your own sushi.

333
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,340
这里没有WiFi吗
Ugh, no Wi-Fi?

334
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,960
你的马有移动热点吗  艾迪森
Does your horse even have a mobile hot spot, Addison?

335
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,340
艾迪森  我能和艾迪聊聊吗  我的读书伙伴
Addison, can I talk to Addy, my book buddy?

336
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,450
我必须得是艾迪森
Hmm, I have to be Addison.

337
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:51,510
艾迪只是个小女孩
Addy's just a little girl.

338
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,610
你不记得我们一起读这本书的时候了吗
Don't you remember when we were reading this?

339
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:57,160
我们那时只是孩子  分享着喜欢的东西
We were just kids, sharing something we loved.

340
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,560
艾迪森  她想给你洗脑
Addison, she's trying to influence you,

341
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,260
而且她都不是为了钱
and she's not even monetizing it.

342
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,540
我一定要在圣诞节早上匿名举报她家
I'm so going to swat her house on Christmas morning.

343
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:06,930
别让那个呆子烦你了
Don't let that rando upset you.

344
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,330
吃个抗焦虑的口香糖吧
Have a Klonopin gummy.

345
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,160
做回那个我认识的女孩吧
Be the girl I know you are.

346
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,360
旧书的味道
Old book smell.

347
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,040
别拿着书了  艾迪森  你跟个呆子一样
Stop holding a book, Addison. You're acting like a rando.

348
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:25,640
我叫艾迪
My name is Addy.

349
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,470
我的...
Oh, my...

350
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,020
快跑
Go!

351
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:36,060
跟我们走吧  这里没什么值得你留恋的了
Come with us. There's nothing left for you here.

352
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,470
这是我家  我的东西都在这里
It's my house. All my stuff is in it.

353
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,540
对  对  好吧
Oh, right, right. Well, all right.

354
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,570
或许我们可以在图书馆再见
Maybe I'll see you at the library.

355
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:44,680
丽莎
Lisa?

356
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,940
你是我最好的礼物
You were my best gift.

357
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:52,020
艾迪森  你疯了吗
Addison, are you out of your mind?

358
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,860
网飞该拍一部关于你社交生活的连续剧
Netflix should make a series about your social life,

359
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,350
因为它刚刚自杀身亡了
because it just committed suicide.

360
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,090
她真够坏的
She is so mean.

361
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,570
我想跟她做朋友
I want to be her friend.

362
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:03,670
真的
Literally.
