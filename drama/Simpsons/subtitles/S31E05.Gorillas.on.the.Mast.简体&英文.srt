她的头发不会被拂过  风吹过的时候会有怪声

167
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:38,920
看看我们在哪  靠着水边的码头
Look where we are. A dock next to the water.

184
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,870
希望不是约翰尼·德普的

185
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,450
他已经有太多财务上的麻烦了

只有放生一只动物我才会开心
I'm not gonna be happy till I set another animal free.

现在我不能再放生鱼了

222
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,640
因为他们加强了水上乐园的安保

我可能不小心多卖出了几个股份
I, uh, may have sold some extra shares,

337
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,200
这些人恐怕都是船的共同拥有者了

跟拥有自己船的人一样好
as good as someone who owns a boat

440
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,490
因为你们也拥有过5分钟的船
because you owned a boat for five minutes.

441
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,000
你的确给了我们一些可以抵消损失的东西
Well, you did give us something for our money:

442
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,080
美好的回忆
