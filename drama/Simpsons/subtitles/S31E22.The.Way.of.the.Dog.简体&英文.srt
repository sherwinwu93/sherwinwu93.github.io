这件事实现了之后也没那么有意思

狗狗心理医生

明晚是终极格斗冠军赛243

91
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,610
你为什么那么在乎一场破格斗比赛
Why do you care so much about one stupid fight?

92
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,660
因为他花了60块钱去看
'Cause he paid 60 bucks to watch it.

93
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,260
60块钱去看一场比赛
60 bucks to watch a fight?

94
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,720
其实是70块  我买的高清
Actually, 70. I got it in HD.

95
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,200
我们都没有高清电视
We don't even have an HDTV.

96
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,820
我想让付费电视的运营商以为我是个大人物
I wanted the pay-per-view operator to think I was a big shot.

97
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:04,340

这只狗  狗  狗怎么回事
What's wrong with that dog... dog... dog?

99
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,260

我喜欢玩糖果消消乐
I love playing Candy Crush.

102
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,580
爸爸  我有事和你讲
Dad, I need to tell you something,

103
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,670
但是悲观的来说
but I've come to the sad conclusion

104
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,570
我认为你理解雌性的声音会有困难
that you have difficulty hearing the female voice.

105
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,290
我也爱你  宝贝
Aw, I love you, too, honey.

106
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,480
因此  我委托巴仔替我发言
Therefore, I have deputized Bart to speak for me.

107
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,450
你好吗
How you doin'?

108

爸爸  我认为你是一位可敬的人

109
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,700
真的吗

110
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,340

终将做出正确的决定
"...eventually do the right thing,

115
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,260
但是圣诞老人的小帮手遇到了麻烦
"But Santa's Little Helper is in crisis,

116
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,170
等待你的最终觉悟恐怕为时已晚
and 'eventually' may be too late."

117
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,310
讲得不错  孩子
Aw. Well said, boy.

118
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,810
丽莎写的这个文章赢得了我最高的敬意

120
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,970
现在我们放松一下
Now we party.

121
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,570
你为什么这样吃糖
Why do you eat candy that way?

122
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,700
-我已经刷过牙了  -好吧
- I already brushed my teeth. - Oh.

126
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,560
和狗待在一起的时间越长
"The more I spend time with dogs, the more I realize

127
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,400
我越能感受到与人类相比我更喜欢狗
that I entirely prefer them to people."

128
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,900
不  不  我是认真的
No, no, I'm serious.

129
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,180
我真的看不起你们
I really despise you.

130
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,220
看不起我们吗  我作为狗的主人
Despise us? I... Hey, as the owner of a dog,

131
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,810
还有老虎和海豚的主人  我被极度冒犯到
a tiger and a dolphin, I am highly offended.

132
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,620
极度冒犯
Highly!

133
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,970
好吧  首先
Okay, first of all,

134
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:56,170
我讨厌你们把自己称为主人
I hate that you call yourselves "Owners."

135
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,810
你拥有一个生命吗
You own living beings?

136
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,190
太好了
Nice.

137
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,090

138
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,940
克雷顿  我现在不方便接电话
Clayton, I can't talk right now.

139
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,330
我离开了她
I've left her.

140
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,400
我离开了我的妻子
I have left my wife.

141
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,840
什么  真的吗
What? Really?

142
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:16,420
你我从小学起就彼此相爱
You and I have loved each other since primary school.

143
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,750
她知道这点
She knew that,

144
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,270
所以我觉得她松了一口气
so I think she was relieved.

145
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,810
克雷
Oh, Clay.

146
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,200
我都已经不抱希望了
I'd stopped allowing myself to hope.

147
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,490
可是  我想我得过会儿再给你回电话
But, uh... I think I got to call you right back.

148
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,190
别  别  别挂电话
No, no! Stay on the call.

149
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,750
我们正听得津津有味呢
We're invested.

150
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,050
我得挂电话了  我正在演讲呢
I have to go. I'm giving a lecture.

151
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,280
等等  等等
Wait! Wait!

152
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,110
我们会结婚的  是吧
We're getting married, right?

153
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,870
是  当然  当然  是  随便你
Yeah, sure, sure, yeah, whatever.

154
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,750
等等
Wait!

155
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,090
没错
Oh. Yes.

156
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,770
你们不配有狗
You don't deserve dogs!

157
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,690
它们嗅出你的疾病
They sniff out your diseases

158
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:47,060
在你乘飞机时安慰你
and comfort you when you ride planes.

159
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:51,700
可总有人问我  "怎么能让我的狗听话"
And I constantly hear: "How do I get my dog to listen?"

160
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,440
- 勒住他的脖子直到他认输  -老天
- Choke him till he taps out! - Oh, good God!

161
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,790
总是问狗能为你做什么
Always what can your dog do for you.

162
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,210
从来没有人问过我
Never once has somebody asked:

163
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,720
"我的狗是想表达什么"
"What is my dog trying to say?"

164
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,810
坏人  坏人
Bad! Bad!

165
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,750
你们个个都是坏人
All of you, bad!

166
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,930
这是我上过的最糟的辅导课
This was the worst extension class I ever took. My God.

167
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,940
比插花课还糟糕
It was even worse than flower arranging.

168
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,490
谁会知道石头花属应该放哪啊
I mean, who can say where baby's breath should go?

169
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,490
{\an8}石竹科植物底下的一个属

170
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,720
反正我不知道  我就告诉你这么多
Huh. Not I. Tell you that much.

171
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,180
女士...
Uh, ma'am...

172
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,000
给我跪下
Down.

173
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,190
没事的  我们没有恶意
It's okay. We're friendly.

174
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:25,290
女士  我知道您曾经和我一样
Ma'am, I know you were once a young,

175
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,510
是一个好问的小姑娘
inquisitive girl like me.

176
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,180
和你可不一样
Mm, not like you, no.

177
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,790
我知道什么时候该保持沉默
I knew when to keep quiet.

178
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,110
求你了  我的狗神经崩溃了
Please. My dog is having a breakdown.

179
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,230
所以如果这些眼泪打动不了你...
So if these tears mean nothing to you...

180
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,700
帮我的狗  不然就和我干架
...help our dog, or let's do this!

181
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,600
拿好我的项链
Hold my pearls!

182
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,290
听着  我很抱歉
Look, I'm sorry,

183
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,710
我不能
I just can't d...

184
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,540
妈呀
Oh, my.

185
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,610
可怜的小家伙
You poor boy.

186
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,700
你是有故事的狗子
You've got a story to tell.

187
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,000
能教教我们怎么做吗
Could you teach us to do what you do?

188
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,120
从他的视角看世界
To see the world through his eyes?

189
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,370
不是从他的视角
Oh, not through his eyes.

190
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,590
这是重点
That's the point.

191
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:09,770
狗的主导感官是嗅觉
A dog's dominant sense is smell.

192
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,880
他用鼻子认识世界
He sees the world with his nose,

193
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,580
他能闻到的比我们能看到的多得多
and his nose sees so much more than our eyes.

194
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,860
比如  我们看到的是路灯柱
For instance, we see a lamppost.

195
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:24,330
你的狗看到的是每一个曾经路过的人
Your dog sees everyone who's ever been here.

他崇拜我  因为知道我能帮忙

But I can't.

201

一个女人只能铲有限的屎
A woman can only scoop so much poop.

202
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,740
停下
Stay.

203
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,980
做得好
Good stay.

204
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,080

212

213
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,990

Look under the tree.

214
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,540
如果他要留在外面  我也一样

215
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,160
你不能留在外面
You are not staying outside!

216
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,700
你说了不算
You are not the boss here!

217
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,350
我说了算  他雇了我来对你发号施令
Well, I am, and he paid me to tell you what to do.

218
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,430
这个男孩要睡在外面
This boy is sleeping outside.

219
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,430
遵命
Yes, sir.

220
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,720
-我们要怎么办  -别担心  亲爱的

你怎么啦  伙计
What's up with you, fella?

227
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,450
他咬了我妈妈
Um, he bit my mom.

228
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,620
我明白了  正好有人取消了预约
Oh, I see. Well, we've had a cancellation,

229
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,710
如果你们愿意  我们现在就可以让他安乐死
so if you like, we can just put him down right now.

230
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,510
-什么  -不行啊
- What?! - No!

231
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:25,200
我...我不觉得有那个必要
I-I don't think that's necessary.

232
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,390
不  但我觉得咬人这种事有一次就有一百次
Oh, no, I'm afraid once a biter always a biter.

233
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,190
除非你们能好好训练一下他
Unless you, like, train 'em or something,

234
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,270
但那样巨麻烦
but that's... that's crazy hard.

235
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,130
需要我给你们一点时间道别吗
Would you like a minute to say goodbye?

236
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,010
想都别想  我们走了
No way. We're leaving.

237
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,610
我甚至看都不想看你
And I don't even want to look at you.

238
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:40,140
我觉得我现在就像皮克斯的标志
Hmm. I feel like the Pixar logo.

239
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,640
我们该拿这条狗怎么办呢
What are we going to do with the dog?

240
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,090
我想他只能先住在我给他
I guess he's just gonna have to stay in the doghouse

241
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,280
盖的狗窝里了
I built for him.

242
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,380
你们好孩子们  兽医报告了说你们的狗会咬人
Hey-a, kids. The vet reported your dog as a biter,

243
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,440
所以我要在这等到动物管理的人来
so I'm supposed to wait until animal control gets here

244
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,030
把他带走
to take him away.

245
00:10:59,270 --> 00:10:59,950
什么
What?

246
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,280
所以  在我们等候的这段时间里
So, uh, well, while we wait,

247
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,410
你们想玩"西蒙说"吗
uh, you want to play Simon Says?

248
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,120
西蒙说不要杀我们的狗
Simon says don't kill our dog.

249
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,640
我才是西蒙
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm Simon.

250
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,260
你不是西蒙
You're-you're not Simon.

251
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,750
爸爸  他们来抓我们的狗了
Dad! They're coming for our dog!

252

我不会同意的  你这个蓝色大气球
I won't let you, you... you big blue balloon.

这画面我挺喜欢  想象一下我在狂欢游行中
Ooh, I like the image. Hey, imagine me in a parade, huh?

254
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,970
多酷啊
Oh, boy.

255
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:26,600
该死
Oh, darn it.

你打过去告诉他们
You call them and tell them

257
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,610
我们是不会让你带走我们的狗的
we are not letting you take our dog.

258
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,960
我取消不了  软件上都显示了
I can't cancel. They're already on the app.

259
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,120
它说他们还有六分钟就到了  你看

Oh, they missed a turn.

262
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,850
现在他们掉头了
Oh, now they're doing a U-ey.

263
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:43,510
天啊  希望他们安乐死的技术比开车好
Geez, hope this guy euthanizes better than he drives.

我在狗狗眼睛里看到些东西
Something I saw in your dog's eyes.

271
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,290
他处于崩溃边缘
He's at breaking point, and unless he has

272
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:03,450
除非有发泄口  否则情况会很糟
some kind of catharsis, something terrible could happen.

273
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,030
他咬了我妈
He bit my mom.

274
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,710
我果然是对的
It is gratifying to be right.

275
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,940

我是不会空手走的

-给我个三明治  -不
-Make me a sandwich. -No.

282
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,820
好吧
Okay, all right.

283

288
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,730
以后谁跟我一起追松鼠啊
Now who will chase squirrels with me?

289
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,630
你们该走了
You better get going.

290
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,870
等等  虽然我不是个善于表达感情的人
Wait. I'm not an emotional guy, but...

Have some Lambien. It'll help you sleep.

312
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:50,850
爸  我的狗还会回来吗
Dad, am I gonna get my dog back?

313
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,860
当然了
Of course.

314
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,400
但是以防万一  我知道父亲不该
But just in case, I know this isn't the kind of thing

315
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,550
这么跟儿子说  不过我们来祈祷吧
a father says to his son, but let's pray.

316
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,730
全能的犬类守护神  圣伯纳犬
Almighty patron saint of dogs, Saint Bernard...

317
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:06,040
-我能一起吗  -当然了
- Can I join in? - Sure.

318
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,410
我也一起祈祷
I'll pray, too.

319
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,470
或许要永远失去我们的狗
Losing our dog, possibly forever,

320
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,300
真的让我们一家人凝聚在一起了
has really brought us together.

321
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,600
我不要
No!

322
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,420
抱歉  抱歉  我们还是祈祷吧
Sorry, sorry. Back to the prayer.

323
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,030
现在我要看看什么会引发你的失控
Okay, now I need to see what set you off.

324
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:22,220
对于马姬你有什么感觉
How do you feel about Marge?

325
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,030
她让你很舒适
She is comfort.

326
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,420
到底发什么了什么
So, what happened?

327
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,030
艾琳  你在吗
Elaine? Hello?

328
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,330
车来了  托斯卡纳等着我们
The car is here. Tuscany awaits.

329
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,070
克雷
Oh, Clay.

330
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:50,040
我应该打电话给你的
I should have called.

331
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,100
亲爱的  我做了一些冲动的事
Darling, I've done something impulsive.

332
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,320
你知道母亲一直很想让你戴她的戒指
You know how Mother always wanted you to wear her ring,

333
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,470
但是我们俩当时还成不了  她就过世了
but she died at a time when we had no hope.

334
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:03,030
心痛之余  我就让她和戒指一起下葬了
And in my heartache, I let them bury her with it.

335
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:07,880
这次我把她挖了出来  你愿意嫁给我吗
So I dug her up and, uh, will you marry me?

336
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,870
我知道"掘墓"
I know "Exhumed"

337
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,470
不是什么浪漫的词  但是
isn't usually the most romantic word, but...

338
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,360
克雷  我现在不能嫁给你
Oh, Clay. I can't marry you now.

339
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,440
但我过几周可以去托斯卡纳找你
But I can meet you in Tuscany in a few weeks.

340
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,920
我可能不会在那里
I might not be there.

341
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,030
我还比不过一只摇尾巴的狗吗
I can't compete with a wagging tail.

342
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,210
再见  克雷
Goodbye, Clay.

343
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,070
{\an8}死人的戒指

344
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:29,010
我告诉你  我早就不爱你了
I want you to know I'm already over you.

345
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,210
不  别这样  不怪你
Oh, no, no, not your fault.

346
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,890
愚蠢的人类感情罢了  我们干正事吧
Human nonsense. Let's get back to work.

347
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,860
今天我想让你与大家互动一下
Today, I want you to interact with the pack.

348
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,010
结识几个朋友  闻闻陌生的屁股
Mingle. Sniff a butt you don't know.

349
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,500
有意思
Okay, interesting.

350
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,060
我们来深入挖掘一下
Let's explore that.

351
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,630
你把它埋在这里是为什么呢
You buried this here. Why?

352
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,250
这顶帽子是解开你心结的关键吗
Is this the key that unlocks your psyche?

353
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,160
汪一声代表  "是"
Bark once for "Yes," Bark twice

354
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,800
汪两声代表"从犬类心理学上讲不会这么简单"
for "That's too simplistic a view of canine psychology."

355
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,710
你好呀  这是我们的狗吗
Oh, hi. Is that our dog?

356
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:25,880
还是为了糊弄孩子找了只一模一样的
Or one that looks just like it to fool the kids?

357
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,330
你回来了
You're back!

358
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,210
这东西是哪来的
Where did this come from?

359
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:33,500
我觉得应该是从北极来的
Uh, I would have to say the North Pole?

360
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:37,270
{\an8}春田商场之财产

361
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,800
等等爸爸  这是我们领养圣诞老人小福星那天
Wait, Dad? That was the hat I was wearing

362
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,480
我带着的帽子  还记得吗
the night we got Santa's Little Helper, remember?

363
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,000
-快  快  冲鸭  -冲鸭  圣诞老人小福星
- Go! Go! Come on, boy! - Go, Santa's Little Helper!

364
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,840
-快跑快跑  -快追上那只兔子
- Run! Run! - Come on! Get that rabbit!

365
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,980
战犬从外圈快速追近
Dog of War coming up fast on the outside...

366
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,920
我们能留下他吗  求你了爸爸
Aw, can we keep him, Dad? Please?

367
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,020
但他是个失败者  他很可悲
But he's a loser. He's pathetic.

368
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,940
他...
He's...

369
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,000
是一名辛普森
a Simpson.

370
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,030
原来圣诞老人小福星是一只赛犬
Santa's Little Helper was a racing dog?

371
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,720
不算一只合格的赛犬  跑得还没我快
Not much of one. Even I could beat him.

372
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,200
这下我就全搞懂了
Oh, it's all clear now.

373
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,080
你的狗患有创伤后精神压力症
Your dog has PTSD.

374
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,880
必须让他和虐待他的人对峙才行
And he has to confront his abuser,

375
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,780
现在立刻马上就去
and he's gonna do it right now.

376
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:10,510
其实我们正在举办节日聚餐...
Actually, we're in the middle of a holiday brunch, so...

377
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,250
不过我会跟你去的
But I-I'm with you.

378
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,910
大家再见
Uh, goodbye, everybody.

379
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:17,570
每人可以从泡芙塔上摘几个球来着
So, how many balls are we allowed of croquembouche?

380
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,380
看看他家有没有HBO GO频道
Let's see if they have HBO GO.

381
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,000
我一直想看看《迷醉》
I've wanted to watch Euphoria,

382
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,520
但是又不好意思在自己的电视上留下观看记录
but I'm embarrassed to have it in my viewing history.

383
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,300
{\an8}不杀生狗舍
顺着路开就到了

384
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,420
是莱斯摩尔  赛狗训练师吗
Les Moore? Greyhound trainer?

385
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,490
-正是在下  -虐狗者
- Yeah, that's me. - Dog abuser!

386
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,040
能给你倒杯水泼在我脸上吗
Can I offer you a drink to throw in my face?

387
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,990
-好  乐意之至  -我猜也是
- Yeah, I'd like that. - Yes, I bet you would.

388
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,840
当然了  我只是在嘲讽
I was being sarcastic, naturally.

389
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,230
不是所有的驯兽师都是魔鬼
Not all trainers are monsters.

390
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:49,670
我记得这只小狗  圣诞老人小福星
Yeah, I remember this mutt. Uh, Santa's Little Helper.

391
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,550
没错  你们把他的名字改成什么了
Yeah! Hey, what'd you rename him?

392
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,690
-我们没改  -你们真够懒的
- We didn't. - Boy, are you lazy.

393
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,020
他生来就是同类中速度最快的之一
He was born to one of the fastest in the business,

394
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,980
饼干妈妈  他是她最宠爱的孩子
She Biscuit. Oh, he was her favorite.

395
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,840
老天  他也很爱她
And boy, did he love her.

396
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,640
我们就是那样知道他跑得有多快的
That's how we learned how fast he was.

397
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,510
所以当然  我们把他从母亲身边永远带走了
So naturally, we took him from his mother forever.

398
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,520
你刚刚是又扇了我一巴掌吗
Did you just slap me again?

399
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,480
-是我扇的  -你插队了  我还想扇呢
- That was me. - You cut the line. I want to slap.

400
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,860
来吧  阿麦
Here, Maggie.

401
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:20,380
-好了  我们都扇过了  -并不是
- There. Now we've all had a turn. - Not quite.

402
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,530
行了  我知道了
Ow! Okay, I get it.

403
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:26,310
突然之间  折磨狗的人就成了坏人
Boy, suddenly, the guy who tortures dogs is the bad guy.

404
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,790
他想干什么
Now what does he want?

405
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,780
我的老天爷
Son of a gun.

406
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,090
他要去哪里
Where's he going?

407
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,420
去找他的妈妈
To his, uh, to his mother.

408
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:43,570
我喜欢皆大欢喜的结局
Oh, I love happy endings.

409
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,340
*回忆*
*Memories*

410
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,700
*点亮了我心灵的角落*
*Light the corners of my mind*

411
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,110
他会没事的
He'll be all right now.

412
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,010
-太感谢你了  -不用谢
- Thank you so much. - Oh, you're welcome.

413
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,630
我得回家了  我有20只狗要遛
I better be getting home. I've got 20 dogs to walk.

414
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,560
要是有人帮帮我就好了
I could, uh, use some help.

415
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,220
好吧
Fine.

416
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:34,980
家里所有人都解决了问题  这真是太好了
It's so great everyone in this family worked out their issues.
