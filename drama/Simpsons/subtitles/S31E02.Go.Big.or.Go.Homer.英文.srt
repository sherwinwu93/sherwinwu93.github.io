19
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,690
Oh, boy, Lenny is gonna be so surprised.

20
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,660
And I got the perfect card.

22
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:16,770
Yeah.

24
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,520
Having chipped in, you may now sign.

25
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:23,770
Nice work.

26
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,320
No "Best wishes," I like the restraint.

27
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,760
Yeah, I thought about "Regards," But Lenny knows how I feel.

28
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,890
Okay, everybody, be quiet.

29
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,990
Lenny's gonna be here any minute. Shh.

31
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,570
Sur... prise.

32
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,320
I thought this was my blood transfusion room,

33
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,430
but, uh, there's not a baby in sight.

34
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,020
It's a surprise party for Lenny, sir.

35
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,220
Everybody chipped in five bucks for a card and a cake

36
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,180
and a show by close-up magician Abraca-Debra.

37
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,230
What? Damn!

38
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,970
Well, in that case, I suppose I should sign, too.

39
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,670
"With regards, C. Montgomery Burns."

40
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,800
Ah, Lenny, happy birthday.

44
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,040
This is the greatest birthday ever!

45
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,810
And best of all, Mr. Burns signed my card.

46
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,610
To everyone who chipped in.

47
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,140
Chipped in. Chipped in.

48
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,240
Chipped in.

49
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,010
What kind of person signs a birthday card

50
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,430
and doesn't chip in?

51
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,520
You sign the card, you got to chip in.

52
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,910
- It's the code of the card. - How big did he sign?

53
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,060
Eddie Bauer big.

54
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,560
Stupid unpaid signature.

55
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,320
This is the worst thing that ever happened

56
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,810
at a nuclear power plant.

57
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,940
Homie, just let it go.

58
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,690
Don't let a signature drive you crazy.

59
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:08,900
You're right, honey.

60
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,360
I'll let it go.

61
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,730
I don't know what I'd do without you.

63
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,890
Happy birthday, Lenny.

64
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,190
No. No!

65
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,660
No!

66
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,210
Homie, what is it?

67
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,100
I had the most horrible nightmare

68
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,680
where I listened to your advice.

70
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,790
Okay, okay.

71
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,180
Okay, Homer, you can do this.

72
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,890
You can make things right.

73
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,470
Mr. Burns, everyone who signed

74
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,090
that birthday card chipped in except for you.

75
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,050
You owe five dollars.

76
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,010
How dare you...

77
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,460
give that the slightest worry.

78
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,260
Hope you didn't lose any sleep

79
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,010
over this little misunderstanding.

80
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,840
Here, have a cricket on a thread for good luck.

81
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,550
You monster...

82
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,160
taking advantage of an old man.

83
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,310
What are you talking about?

84
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,000
Mr. Burns is heavily medicated

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,340
on a round-the-clock regimen of skin thickeners.

86
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,470
The side effect of that medication

87
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,630
is bouts of uncontrollable decency.

88
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,370
And you exploited that.

89
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,030
I'm demoting you to the worst job in this place:

90
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,100
supervising the nuclear plant interns.

91
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,460
Listen up, millenniums. I'm Homer Simpson,

92
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,730
your new supervisor.

93
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,260
So stop Snapchatting, Fortnite-ing

94
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,490
and swiping right on your Uber Venmos.

95
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,620
We're actually replicating plant start-up sequences

96
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,480
to simulate the effects of high-demand energy draws.

97
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,640
Contamination versus irradiation--

98
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,430
your thoughts?

99
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,750
Address rate of reaction.

100
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,940
What variables can we assume?

101
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,510
This guy is denser than osmium-188.

102
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,410
Are my ears hearing this?

103
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,680
Are you seriously busting the clangers

104
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,540
of Homer J. Simpsons?

105
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,190
This man is a god and his clangers are unbustable.

106
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,140
You're looking at the Michael Jordan

107
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,720
of Sector 7G.

108
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,970
And you humps aren't worthy to swill his backwash.

109
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,140
You're sticking up for me?

110
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,240
Who are you?

111
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,440
Mike Wegman, nuclear intern.

112
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,970
And your number one fan.

113
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,270
Yeah, well, your hero has a Pop-Tart

114
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,990
in his cell phone holster.

115
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,850
Are you kidding?

116
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,080
No one disrespects Homer Simpsons.

117
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,910
Not you, Ricky, with your standing desk.

118
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,230
It's not a workout; it's been disproven.

119
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,590
And not you, Gretchen,

120
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,110
drinking coffee creamer straight from the bottle.

121
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,340
You exude amaretto, you freak.

122
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,130
And, Benjamin, no one ever got trampled

123
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,200
at a Michael Bublé concert.

124
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,320
Drop the friggin' lawsuit, you're clogging up the system.

125
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,130
This man is a dynamo.

126
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,790
So you shaved coconuts give him your full respect.

127
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,880
All right, all right. Sorry, Mr. Simpson.

128
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,080
Looking forward to learning from you, Mr. Simpson.

129
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,280
People at work usually yell at me, not for me.

130
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,740
How do you know who I am?

131
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,800
So modest. What a dynamo.

132
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,020
Because of this.

134
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,860
Whenever there's trouble,

135
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,590
you are at the heart of the action.

136
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:38,520
Number six is why all those horses went bald.

137
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,330
Yeah. Well, I-I-I've been looking up to you for so long

138
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,930
from the cheap seats, and now we're finally face-to-face,

139
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,570
I can't believe I'm saying this, but I got to ask,

140
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,090
w-will you be my coach? My sensei?

141
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,130
Homer J. Simpsons, will you be my mentor?

142
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,720
If you accept, let me know

143
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,850
by taking this half a PowerBar.

144
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,850
I rolled up the wrapper really good so there's no pocket lint.

145
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:06,460
Mike Wegmans, I will be your mentor.

147
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,400
Okay, which of these ties is better

148
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,730
for my first day as a mentor?

149
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,970
Purple stripes or this one?

151
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,070
Are you wearing my perfume?

152
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,430
I like it on you, he'll like it on me.

153
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,700
Dad, it's not often that you--

154
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,700
how do I put this?--

155
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,480
care so much about your job?

156
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:39,790
Well, now that I'm a mentor, everything's changed.

157
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,750
For the first time, another human being

158
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,720
is dependent on me to guide them through life.

159
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,600
This guy I'm menting is so cool.

160
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,510
He listens with his mouth open.

161
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,950
He's been blocked by so many celebrities on Twitter.

162
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,760
And he thinks I'm the most valuable worker

163
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,960
at the entire nuclear plant.

164
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,070
Oh, I get it.

165
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,490
He's super dumb.

166
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,530
Mock all you want.

167
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,680
I finally have someone at work who admires me.

168
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,810
He's fat.

169
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,470
Homer, your pants.

170
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,340
They'll come around again.

171
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,940
They always do.

173
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,590
There's my thoroughbred.

174
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,650
I-I got your coffee just the way you like it.

175
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,730
No coffee, just doughnut holes.

177
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,120
Oh, my God, are you busting my bricks?

178
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,450
I-Is this real?

179
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,210
Sector 7G.

180
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:36,640
7G, where Olympus fears to tread.

181
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,770
He sure does.

182
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:41,130
Okay, you are a category five hurricane of knowledge,

183
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,960
and I'm like that old idiot who won't leave his beach house.

184
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,710
Please, drown me in my attic with what you know.

185
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,150
I thought you might say that.

186
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,900
So I've prepared inspirational posters.

188
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,320
I feel like Amar'e Stoudemire

189
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,840
when he first set foot in Jerusalem.

190
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,590
W-What else you got?

191
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:00,790
Uh, let's see...

192
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,280
- Don't forget about the, uh... - Y-Y-Y-Y-Y-Yeah.

193
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,310
- Oh, uh, and, of course, - Gold.

194
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,000
- you got to, you just got to. - Gold. Okay.

195
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,480
- Because if you don't... - Soakin' it in. Gold.

196
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,570
- Well, oh. - Soakin' it in.

197
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,920
- Well, they don't have that anymore. - I can remember this.

198
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,260
- And you see these? - Yeah.

199
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,010
- I'm gonna tell you that later. - Y-Y-Y-Y-Y-Yeah.

200
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,180
I can't believe this.

201
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,040
I-I'm only 35 and I am sitting at the feet

202
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,980
of the atomic Baba Booey.

203
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,650
You're 35?

204
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,490
Then why do you have a job of a 20-year-old

205
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,060
and talk like a ten-year-old?

206
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:26,980
Here's how it is.

207
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,400
So, my buddy 'Nesto and me

208
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,930
were cleaning gutters for cash,

209
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,250
when that idiot 'Nesto falls off

210
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,240
and lands on a doghouse. Stupid 'Nesto.

211
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,760
Then my parents are on my case to get a real career,

212
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,520
something "closer to the ground."

213
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,600
So I thought, "Why not follow my hero

214
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,320
"into man's greatest calling?

215
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,910
Nuclear whatever."

216
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,970
So I went down to the plant,

217
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,920
told them I was part Native American--

218
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,890
I could be, I always liked those guys--

219
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,970
and boom! I'm an intern.

220
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,870
Three short years later, got myself a mentor.

221
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,760
Wow. My posters really worked.

222
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,830
But you don't need me telling you how great you are,

223
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,640
y-you get enough of that at home.

224
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,030
Happy birthday, Lenny.

226
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,940
Say, Mike,

227
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,680
why don't you come over to my house for dinner?

228
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,930
I've got some people I'd like to introduce

229
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,880
to the way you act around me.

230
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,570
Okay. I-I could do that.

231
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,160
I could make that happen.

232
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,840
Huh. I got this.

233
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,000
Hey, Lenny, you duck-faced psycho,

234
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,040
guess who's going to Homer Simpson's house for a meal? Me.

235
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,400
Uh, I'm Carl.

236
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,750
I wish you would give me more of a heads-up

237
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,320
before inviting a mentee for dinner.

238
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,580
I guess we'll have enough

239
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,460
if I double the chip layer on the casserole.

240
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:44,350
Don't worry, you're gonna love this kid.

241
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:47,360
Kid? He looks 40-plus.

242
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,140
Oh, Homer, she is a beaut.

243
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,430
Now I know why you're always napping at work.

244
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,320
Mr. Plow, indeed.

246
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,060
Hello. I'm Marge.

247
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,860
Mike Wegman. This is Maureen.

248
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,670
And this is Patrick Ewing Wegman.

250
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,390
It's a girl. You can't name her Patrick.

251
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,170
2.4 blocks per game, lifetime.

252
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,550
She's Patrick.

253
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,040
Look at this spread.

254
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,640
I-I was expecting, like, a-a party sub,

255
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,060
but hot carrots? Who thinks of that?

256
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,810
Slow it, you'll burn your mouth again.

257
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,790
All right, all right, I'm gonna blow on 'em.

258
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,550
Thank you for having us.

259
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,310
Mike admires your husband so much.

260
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:26,640
Do you hear that? "So much"!

261
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,750
They don't admire me any much.

262
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,070
You better hold on to this guy, Marge,

263
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,330
'cause if he were single, he'd be cleaning up.

264
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,010
I mean cleaning up, knee-deep.

265
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,500
Don't worry, honey.

266
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,390
You're the only woman for me.

267
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,960
I wasn't worried.

268
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,640
So, Mrs. Wegman, how did you two meet?

269
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,370
Oh, well, you're gonna love this story.

270
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,110
It's so romantic. Tell her, honey.

271
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,230
Go ahead, tell her.

272
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,090
He was a waiter at my wedding.

273
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,230
She was so beautiful, like one of those girls

275
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,480
you see leaving Vinny's bedroom on Entourage

276
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,970
that don't say nothin'.

277
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,910
So, Mike, you seem like a sharp tack.

278
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,290
What exactly is my dad teaching you?

279
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,300
How to eat doughnuts while napping?

280
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,660
Did this little hump just say what I thought I heard?

281
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,280
It's okay, Mike. I don't sweat it.

282
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,960
Yeah, Mike, the only thing Homer sweats is gravy.

283
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,650
No one disrespects Homer Simpsons!

284
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,900
Especially not an ugly little punk like you.

285
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,380
That's right, I said "Ugly."

286
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,340
Your head looks like a rejected Muppet.

287
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,880
Two golf balls glued to a can of oats.

288
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,470
Between that Tommy Lasorda gut and those toothpick legs,

289
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:40,240
you are not a kid-- you are a walkin' potato clock.

290
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,430
Ha-ha-ha! Ugly! Ha!

291
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,390
Muppet...

292
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,310
Ah! Toothpick legs!

293
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,310
Potato clock!

294
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,860
I'm just bustin' your clangers, kid.

295
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,760
All right, it's okay.

296
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,060
I want you out!

297
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,960
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

298
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,910
Where's the baby registered?!

299
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,290
DraftKings!

300
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,770
How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?

301
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,460
Once would be nice.

302
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,620
Wow, you're really bustin' my clangers.

303
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,140
That guy's a lunatic.

304
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,500
He's not crazy.

305
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,290
He's the only one that respects me!

306
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,520
The kids and I respect you.

307
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,580
All you guys ever did was love me.

308
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,990
But look me in the eyes and tell me you respect me,

309
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,680
as a nuclear guy.

310
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,990
I just liked the feeling

311
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,780
that one person thinks I'm good at something.

312
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,740
Mm, I get it, Homie.

313
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,060
But if you really want to help this guy,

314
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,610
help him grow up.

315
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,750
Come on, Fordham,

316
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,180
Bucknell's got no rim protection.

317
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,560
They're garbage. Just cover the spread.

318
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,450
Hey, Homer. How's it clangin'?

319
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,850
I'm, uh, just tunin' in to a little college hoops.

320
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,400
Yeah, Mike, I was thinking,

321
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:15,200
if you weren't a 35-year-old unpaid intern

322
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,850
with a baby on the way, do you have any other dreams?

323
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,520
Ah, man, you are mentoring me hard right now.

324
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,990
Oh, okay, I'm gonna tell you, but don't laugh.

325
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,090
I won't.

326
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,450
Slices.

327
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,050
Nothing better than getting a slice of pizza, right?

328
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,850
But it's always been under the heat lamp all dried out.

329
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,750
Damn heat lamp.

330
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,640
Right. So why not make the pizza one slice at a time,

331
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,640
hot and fresh?

332
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,200
Every slice is Derek Jeter.

334
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,550
No Scott Brosius in the bunch.

335
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,870
That's genius!

336
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,620
Oh, my God, I can't believe you like it.

337
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,830
Mike! You know what you should call your slices?

338
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,290
Mike's Slices.

339
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,380
I'm Mike!

340
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,030
Yeah! Okay, what you need is an investor,

341
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,550
and I know the perfect person.

342
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,250
He gave me five dollars.

344
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,420
Every slice hot and fresh

345
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,640
from the oven into your mouth.

346
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,530
Every slice a Jeter.

347
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:10,360
No Scott Brosiuses.

348
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,180
Why can't I get a whole pizza and slice it myself?

349
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,670
There are no whole pizzas.

351
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:17,600
It's just slices, hot and fresh.

352
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,230
And don't worry about investing with this guy, Mr. Burns,

353
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,940
because he's backed by the full mentorship

354
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,260
of Homer J. Simpsons.

355
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,620
Then it's my pleasure to tell you...

356
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,330
that that is the stupidest idea I've ever heard.

357
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,740
Get this intern out of my office, you nincompoop!

358
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:41,790
Ho! No one disrespects Homer J. Simpsons.

359
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,100
No, Mike, don't.

360
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:43,930
Nin...

361
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,380
com... poop!

362
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,140
Listen to me, you skunk-bag full of Centrum Silver

363
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,790
sitting on your peanut brittle ass

364
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,790
with your turn-of-the-century buzzard face.

365
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,610
You ain't worthy to squeegee this man's back sweat.

366
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:56,660
You smell like Chinese food that someone left

367
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,040
in an old jack-o'-lantern.

368
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,440
My mentor is the shiniest diamond in the whole Zales,

369
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,090
so stuff your organs back in their jars

370
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,030
and crawl in your mummy box,

371
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,000
you sick, fungused-up, hep-C Dracula!

372
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:14,260
By the way, he's off his happy pills.

373
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,940
You're lucky Mr. Burns gun was 200 years old.

374
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,180
Yeah, but now my doctor says

375
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,240
I can't get shot in the face again.

376
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,400
Who's ugly now, pellet-head?

377
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,450
Come on, it's okay. Don't cry.

378
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,290
I'm not. All the BBs in my head are making it heavy.

379
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:36,080
Mike, this is all my fault.

380
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,850
I know you think I'm a great nuclear guy, but I'm not.

381
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,780
I didn't stop those accidents.

382
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,110
I caused them.

383
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,880
Huh? No. No.

384
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,150
All my posters-- "Bet on Yourself,"

385
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,710
"Go Big or Go Home"--

386
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,950
I was caught shoplifting those from a poster store.

387
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,040
I was trying to go big, and they wouldn't let me go home.

388
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:57,660
Mike, face it, I'm a bad mentor.

389
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,760
No one disrespects Homer Simpsons.

390
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,630
Not even you.

391
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,580
You're the best mentor a lousy bride-banger like me

392
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,520
could ever ask for.

393
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,960
And I'm gonna prove it.

394
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,620
Who spilled BBs all over the... whoa!

395
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,850
Yo! Mentor!

397
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,910
Anybody want a slice of pizza

398
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:26,190
that wasn't sliced from a pizza?

399
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,840
Where'd you get a food truck?

400
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:31,150
It's all cause of you, mentor, all cause of you. Deal with it.

401
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:33,470
The boys and I will take a large pie.

402
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,250
Can't you read a truck, Cookie Puss?

403
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,430
Slices only!

404
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,400
All righty, three slices, please.

405
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:42,260
They'll be ready in 13, 26 and 39 minutes.

406
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,270
And don't block the window, sizzle chest.

407
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,910
When will my slice be ready?

408
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:49,820
And by "Slice," I mean the first payment

409
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,310
on your outstanding loan.

410
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:55,000
You borrowed money from the mob?!

411
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,840
No, no, no, no, no, no. It's all good.

412
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,580
I took a one-week loan from Fat Tony for a hundred grand.

413
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,460
I put $50k into the truck

414
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,010
and then bet the other 50 on tonight's Lehigh game,

415
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,050
which is a lock.

416
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,290
So when I win the bet, I pay back the mob,

417
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,700
and I own the truck free and clear.

418
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,020
Oh, no.

419
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,400
You bet on yourself!

421
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,340
Go big or go home, baby.

422
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,480
And Lehigh's in trouble

423
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,580
as Holy Cross goes on an unanswered 20-point run.

424
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,370
No, no, no, Lehigh is a lock!

425
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:27,160
They're undefeated on floors with hockey ice beneath them.

426
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,270
Yet again, a man's life hangs by the gossamer thread

427
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,600
of Patriot League basketball.

428
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,310
Guns up.

429
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,370
But Lehigh takes the lead with a three

430
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,340
from way behind the arc.

431
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,820
- Yes! - Guns down.

432
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,660
But the Crusaders answer

433
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,140
with a floater in the key!

434
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,770
And Lehigh comes back with a monster dunk!

435
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:50,620
Yeah!

436
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,250
As the final seconds tick away, Lehigh has this one in the bag!

437
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,750
The body bag!

438
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,480
As a last-second half-court heave

439
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,590
gives Holy Cross the win.

440
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,210
Guns up.

441
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,330
Safeties off.

442
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,490
Don't worry, I know a place

443
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,030
where they will never find us.

445
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,540
A food truck graveyard.

447
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,230
Why are there so many failed ones?

448
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,770
'Cause they don't have an original concept, like me.

449
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,710
Homer, I got to tell you one thing.

450
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,220
Your boy's not ugly.

451
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,200
He's gorgeous.

452
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,700
Just like his old man.

453
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,190
He's gonna clean up.

454
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:58,300
Tell baby Patrick I loved her.

455
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,830
All right, do me.

456
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,220
I smell mozzarella

457
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:08,910
gently melting over a single slice of triangular dough.

458
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,000
Before the end, we will share a pie.

459
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,480
It's just slices, you goombah caveman!

460
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,110
Mmm! Usually a slice is dried out

461
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:22,200
from sitting under a heat lamp, but this is hot and fresh!

462
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,320
See? This guy has good ideas.

463
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,920
What if...

464
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:29,560
you let Mike work in the truck to pay you back?

465
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,460
No. The food truck business is too big a gamble.

466
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,520
And even our gambling operation is in trouble

467
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,770
with the advent of legal online wagering.

468
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,280
Too bad you can't take action out of my food truck,

469
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,860
let the betting come to you.

470
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,630
Now, do me already!

471
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,710
A food truck that takes bets?

472
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,380
I'll take a slice of cheese

473
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,620
and the moneyline on Georgetown.

474
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:58,040
Yo, Tony! We're raking it in on the sportsbook.

475
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,230
And it was a great idea to sell weed out of this thing also.

476
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,640
Homer, you believed in this stagelagoots

477
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,230
when no one else would.

478
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,570
You listened to him,

479
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,120
nurtured his ideas,

480
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,300
and now he is a success.

481
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:18,230
Truly, you're a excellent mentor.
