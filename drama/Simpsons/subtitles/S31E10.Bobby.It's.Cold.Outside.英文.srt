20
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,950
And now to order my Christmas gifts with plenty of time.

24
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,370
UPS tracking says my packages just arrived.

25
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,230
All I have to do is look down.

27
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,830
Who could've done this? Who?

28
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,250
*Ding-donong, merrily on hi*

29
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,130
*In heaven the bells are ringing*

31
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,380
*Ding-dong, Bart is gonna die*

32
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,740
*His little neck I'm stringing.*

34
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:16,890
Needs tinsel

35
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,250
to reflect the horror in Bart's eyes.

37
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,340
Oh, a visitor. Coming.

38
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:31,110
Ahoy! Are there any lonely lighthouse keepers abaft here?

39
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,760
Oh, hello, Cassandra.

40
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,410
Surprise! I made you muffins.

41
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,700
You want to know a secret?

42
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,790
I used two sticks of butter.

43
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,400
Do you have any deep dark secrets?

47
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,200
Merry Christmas, Father!

48
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,830
Stay out of trouble.

49
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,770
Nope. No secrets.

50
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,920
So, have you ever thought about children?

51
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,890
Missed me! Missed me! Now you gotta kiss me!

52
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,560
Oh, if you'll excuse me,

53
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,310
my gimbals need a good whale oiling.

54
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,830
you might get some other visitors.

55
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,770
I mentioned you in town today.

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,540
You told people about me? What did you tell them?! What?!

57
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,840
That you had kind eyes, a beautiful voice,

58
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,700
and no wedding ring.

59
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,160
There he is!

60
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,350
I was a fool to let my guard down with a woman

61
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:42,310
who runs a seaward-aiming Fresnel lens!

62
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,890
From hell's heart I stab at thee!

63
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:49,060
Oh, my God. Just listen to that mellifluous baritone.

64
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,470
He's perfect for the role.

65
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,440
Role? Role?

66
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,550
You're offering me an acting job?

67
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,180
Yes! It's to play Santa Claus at a small amusement park.

68
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,100
Oh, what the hell. It is the lead. I'm in!

69
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,610
Dinner is served.

73
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,130
Hey, let's see what's on your tag.

74
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,050
"Cadaver-sniffing dog"?!

75
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,870
Ah, that's another job I didn't get.

77
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,630
It's gone. My porch repair kit is gone!

78
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,530
A little help!

79
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,340
Another crafts project gone out of hand?

80
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,090
- Yes. - If you're not tied up tomorrow,

81
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,840
I took the day off from work.

82
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:05,470
I was thinking we could watch an R-rated movie.

83
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:09,850
Finally, the sexy story of Tony Roma's ribs.

85
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,060
But tomorrow I promised the kids I'd take them out of school.

86
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,940
It can be our family day.

87
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,940
Yawn.

88
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,440
We'll go to Santa's Village.

89
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,740
Oh, I hate that place. It's so crowded at Christmas.

90
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,990
And the giant candy canes are not real.

91
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,580
But they are electrified!

92
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,060
Well, we're going and taking the kids.

93
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,730
Why couldn't that be me?

94
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,610
Homer!

96
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,340
*Baby shark, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo*

97
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,470
*Baby shark, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo*

98
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,680
{\an8}*Baby shark, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo*

99
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,760
Oh, God, I'm so sick of this.

100
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,180
{\an8}*Baby shark,*

101
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,080
Thing just keeps going on and on.

102
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,730
{\an8}*Mommy shark Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo*

103
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,650
I don't want to hear a shark or "baby" or "doo" ever again.

104
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,900
{\an8}*Mommy shark Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo*

105
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,940
{\an8}*Mommy shark Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo*

106
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,210
Marge, you traitor!

107
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,520
{\an8}*Mommy shark*

108
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,800
It's so catchy.

109
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,280
{\an8}*Daddy shark, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo*

110
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,510
Oh, what the hell.

111
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,570
{\an8}*Daddy shark, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo*

112
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,610
*Daddy shark, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo*

113
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,800
*Daddy shark*

114
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,770
Play this at my funeral!

117
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,000
Why do the low-budget parks we go to

118
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,400
have so many white trash idiots?

119
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,010
Boy, that's good.

120
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,530
Why? Why?

121
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,370
Well, I'm getting right in line for Santa.

124
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,270
Eight hours to see a fat lazy drunk-o?

125
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,920
I came to this park to get away from one.

127
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,340
Even Chanukah Hollow is packed.

130
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,850
Check out the Dreidel Casino.

131
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,740
Come on, gimmel, gimmel, gimmel!

132
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,660
Ah, shin again!

133
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,150
I thought this would be the one part of Judaism I'm good at.

135
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,920
Typical.

136
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,700
The one ride is a stupid, boring kiddie ride.

137
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,030
At least you get to have fun.

138
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,150
*It's a scary place in the world outside*

139
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,650
*Gnomes are watching you, so you'd best not cry*

140
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,200
*Don't display any fear, this we know*

141
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,070
*Yes, it's clear, all our eyes*

142
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,310
*Are watching you*

143
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,330
*It's a scary place in the world outside*

144
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,790
*Gnomes are watching you, so you'd best not cry*

145
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,420
*Don't display any fear, this we know*

146
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,420
*Yes, it's clear*

147
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,570
*All our eyes are watching you*

149
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,930
Hey, buddy, thanks for saving me a spot.

150
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,330
Bart, you cut the bullies.

151
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,190
In this situation, we assign equal blame

152
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,440
to the cutter and the cuttee.

153
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,400
Let him go. I don't want to get blood on my Christmas sweater.

154
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,150
Oh, there's gonna be blood on your sweater, all right.

155
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,680
I just said I didn't want that!

160
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,050
Hello, young man.

161
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,240
Climb right up.

162
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,350
Santa? Bartholomew Simpson.

163
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,330
- You don't know me, but... - Oh, but I do.

164
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:36,850
Hello-ho-ho, Bart.

165
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,520
Sideshow Bob!

166
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,300
Merry Christmas.

168
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,510
He's in a good mood.

169
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,910
Yes. This is the year I get the monkey.

170
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,490
I keep telling you,

171
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:55,290
a monkey is a huge responsibility.

172
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,520
I'm raising a kid. I think I can raise a monkey.

174
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,930
So easy. After all these years,

175
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:16,010
I get to watch the life drain from your eye, your I...

176
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,060
I can't kill you!

177
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,520
- Want to know why? - Mm, nah.

178
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,230
I am a trained method actor.

179
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,900
I inhabit my roles.

180
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,030
Like Daniel Day-Lewis in Phantom Thread.

181
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,320
Or Mike Myers in The Love Guru.

182
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,160
Why should I trust you?

183
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,280
Because I am utterly incapable of stepping out of character.

184
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,540
I am Santa Claus.

185
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,710
The jolly old elf himself.

186
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,580
So can we get in to see you?

187
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:47,240
15-minute break. Santa's making presents.

191
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,510
I'm telling you, this is Sideshow Bob!

192
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:58,170
- He tried to kill me! - Well?

193
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,980
I am a card-carrying seasonal Santa.

194
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,980
Kris Kringle Union, Local 5732.

195
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,020
Hey, I was a mall Santa, too.

196
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,180
I still wear the belt.

197
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,650
If you're gonna spend this much time with our Santa,

198
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,110
you have to pose for a photo.

199
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,990
Photos with Santa, $40.

200
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,730
Marge, just take one with your phone!

201
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,350
- Got it. - Run!

202
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,750
This will stop the jerks who've been stealing packages off my porch,

204
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,830
a decoy with an exploding dye marker inside.

205
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,420
You don't think you packed in a little too much gunpowder?

206
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,360
Relax. I learned how to do this from my Uncle Two Fingers.

207
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,660
Oh, my God. You're the package thief?

208
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,000
Lenny. Who did this to you? Can you say it?

209
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,790
Can you whisper it?

210
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,300
Can you write it with your blood?

213
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,700
I'm a little worried our Christmas packages haven't arrived.

214
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,410
Marge, relax. There's plenty of time.

215
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:02,160
It's 8:00 P.M. Christmas Eve!

216
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,940
Just sit back and watch this Fox News yule log.

218
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,430
We interrupt this yule log with a special report.

220
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,890
Package delivery thefts continue in Springfield.

221
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,140
Local man Leonard "Lenny" Leonard

222
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:24,060
had his jingle bell rung in a package deal gone boom.

223
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,440
Our only clue is these initials next to the corpse.

224
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,440
He's not a corpse. He's breathing.

225
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,380
I say he's a corpse.

226
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,550
And I say I'm not.

227
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,390
you don't get a vote.

228
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,700
"S.B." is Sideshow Bob!

229
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,240
That's what he's up to.

230
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,120
He's stealing Christmas!

231
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,370
A fellow Santa could not steal Christmas.

232
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,400
I know who this mysterious "S.B." is.

233
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,750
Welcome to jail, Selma Bouvier.

234
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,760
Uh, tell Scott Bakula, Steve Ballmer

235
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,880
and Sandra Bullock they're off the hook.

236
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,290
I should've been back

237
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,260
at NCIS: New Orleans two hours ago.

238
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,390
Why don't you just Quantum Leap there?

239
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,880
Why don't you learn how to be a cop, fatso?

240
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,190
I loved it! Mistaken identity!

241
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:12,770
I sold ten, ten season tickets to the guys in my cell.

242
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:17,260
Everything we do is successful, booyah!

244
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,880
Santa's Village, please.

245
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,360
What do you want to go there for?

246
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,300
I'm saving Christmas.

247
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,090
Every kid thinks they're doing that this time of year.

248
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,890
And as for you, Santa's Village is closed, I'm afraid.

249
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,260
If I wanted your life story, I would've taken an Uber.

250
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,830
Well, that shuts me up.

252
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,940
I'm not gonna leave till I find out what Bob's up to.

253
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,270
If you don't hear from me in one hour, call the police.

254
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,440
I have my own problems, Bart.

255
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,070
My mom just locked my dad out in the snow.

256
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,200
He keeps tapping at my window.

257
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,910
She said if I open it, no presents.

258
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,980
- Useless. - Don't hang up.

260
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,070
Classic evil villain mistake.

262
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,960
Life goals?!

263
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,760
Don't pooh-pooh.

264
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,050
Now for God's sake, how can I convince you

265
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,370
that I am not going to kill you?!

266
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:24,760
Find the person who stole the presents.

267
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,220
Very well. I shall begin by clearing my initials,

268
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:31,100
catching the true "S.B." and, if I must,

269
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,510
save Christmas for everyone.

270
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,230
Now let me drive you home.

271
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,360
You want me to ride with you? Fine.

272
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,430
Shotgun!

274
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,780
Let's roll.

275
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,390
Shotgun means you pay the tolls.

276
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,920
So I'm here to save Christmas, and here's my plan.

277
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,150
First, I conceal myself within this box.

278
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,720
Where'd you learn how to do that?

279
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,580
When you ride cross-country in a clown car, you learn a lot.

280
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,020
Who knew?

281
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,770
- Brava! - Who knew?

282
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:12,440
Thank you.

283
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,900
Now, Homer, gently place me on the porch,

284
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,480
and when they steal me, follow them to their lair.

285
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,470
Will do.

286
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,730
And...

287
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,770
Godspeed.

288
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,570
They'll be here any minute.

290
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,970
Can't breathe.

293
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:23,630
{\an8}*Baby shark, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo*

294
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,630
Oh, my God, S.B. is

295
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,730
Smithers and Burns!

296
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,600
Since when does Smithers go first?

297
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,980
The jig is up!

298
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,130
Also, leg cramp.

299
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,320
The police are on their way.

300
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,360
Who will they believe? You or the billionaire

301
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,240
who just sent them a Montgomery Ward's cheese log?

302
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,160
Mr. Burns, why did you do this?

303
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,120
Ooh, general Scroogeyness.

304
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,440
No, it's deeper. It's much deeper than that.

305
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:01,290
I think Mr. Burns is depressed.

306
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,160
Ooh, you're a very perceptive girl.

307
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,200
That's close enough.

308
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,050
I just wanted everyone to experience

309
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:12,290
the same Christmas heartbreak that I once did.

313
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,400
Papa, sweet Papa,

314
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,320
may I sit on Santa's lap?

315
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,900
Well, I don't know.

316
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,860
Santa Claus, giving away free toys,

317
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,500
undercutting my friends,

319
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,410
Bill Mattel and Fred Hasbro.

320
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,600
Please?

321
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,460
Well, what's on your wish list, little boy?

322
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,300
A Rockford sock monkey, Studebaker pedal car,

323
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,460
or the most popular gift this year, an orange.

324
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,680
All I want is a hug from my mommy

325
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,640
and a smile from my daddy.

326
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,600
Oh, well I'm sure there's a hug and a smile

327
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,230
on their way to you right now. Ho, ho, ho.

328
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,290
Next.

329
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,650
What do you want for Christmas?

330
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:03,480
I want you to marry my mom like you said you would.

331
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,720
Next!

333
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,270
Christmas day came...

334
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:25,340
I'm here to take you to boarding school.

335
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:28,160
- On Christmas Day? - Hey, no traffic.

336
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,010
The next time I saw my parents,

337
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:35,210
they weren't in a smiling mood.

338
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,710
Too late!

339
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,900
You two never gave me anything except $100 million.

340
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,110
Santa lied.

341
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,570
But, Monty, you misunderstood me.

342
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:51,200
Santa? It can't be.

343
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,160
Monty, it's 1935,

344
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,370
and this is Gimbels Department Store,

345
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,370
with the toy train in the window

346
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,660
and Maxie the elevator man.

347
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,250
You're looking at the lingerie department.

349
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,860
You can look. It's okay.

350
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:10,160
Yes. Yes. Yes! I am a child again.

351
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,090
And the truth is, your parents did love you,

352
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,930
not with hugs and kisses, but with something better--

353
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,430
they made you strong.

354
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,850
Where are all the other tycoons from your day?

355
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:22,690
Broke, dead, a lot of #MeToo.

356
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:26,650
But you're the richest, most ruthless man in town,

357
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,090
thanks to your parents' love.

358
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,140
It's true.

359
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,660
Smithers, it's Christmas,

360
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,990
which is a work day for you, so help me out.

361
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,460
And it's my birthday.

362
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,270
Don't expect two presents.

363
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,820
My raisins came!

364
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,370
Well, at least he's eating.

365
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,540
Huzzah for Mr. Burns!

366
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,770
God bless us, every one.

368
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:06,130
Seriously, this is, this is really nice.

370
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,650
We did it.

371
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,860
Got all the presents under the tree.

372
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,740
I'm lucky because no one could possibly steal my gift.

373
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,160
All I want is one peaceful moment

374
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,980
to hold my wife in my arms.

375
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,270
It's Christmas!

376
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,070
Awake already?

377
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,320
- Slide whistle. - Kazoo!

378
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,680
Meet me in the basement.

379
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,220
Okay.

380
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,580
Picture time.

382
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,570
Janey, haven't you learned that silly tune yet?

383
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:55,280
You play it over and over again. Now stop it, stop it!

384
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,510
That girl is pretty bad at the piano.

385
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,240
Hello, Cassandra.

386
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,560
I brought you a Christmas present.

387
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:09,420
I know who you are, and I know what you've done,

388
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,500
and I want you to kiss me.

389
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,510
*You really should go*

390
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,260
*It's 20 below*

391
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,130
*I can't have you here*

392
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,050
*Just get me a beer*

393
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,930
*I'm being a gent*

394
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,260
*I'm giving consent*

395
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,310
*You are quite inviting*

396
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:28,000
*I will put it in writing*

398
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,680
*Baby, it's cold outside*

399
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:42,270
Yarr. Will someone turn on the damn light?!

400
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,100
A little late, don't you think?

401
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:46,860
Yarr!

404
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,110
Steve. Psst. Steve. Wait.

405
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:56,210
Sorry, I'm just about ready to leave your wonderful town.

406
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,680
Great place. Fantastic!

407
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,500
The best Springfield I've ever been in. Whoo!

408
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,600
Can you teach me to do that?

409
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,920
Do what? This is just me.

411
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:12,940
Fantastic coffee! Send a truckful to Seattle.

412
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,380
How can you possibly be so happy?

413
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,190
It's in you too!

414
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,740
I really don't think so.

415
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,610
Monty, look me in the eye!

416
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,560
I don't know if I can.

417
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,000
You're amazingly alive.

418
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,750
You're rich beyond any sense of justice.

419
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:35,150
you're C. Montgomery Burns.

420
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,220
Hurt yourself on the landing, huh?

421
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,250
No. On the way up.
