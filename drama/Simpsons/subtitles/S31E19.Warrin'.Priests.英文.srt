20
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:04,580
They want me back?

23
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,230
No one's here today.

24
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,790
Even the choir's late.

25
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,980
*Michael, take the carpool lane*

26
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,280
*Hallelujah*

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,280
*They just crossed the double line*

28
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,110
*Traffic school them*

29
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,840
Mom, with all the room,

30
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,280
do we have to sit so close to the geezers?

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,660
- It's too hot. - It's too cold.

32
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,950
I'm not even alive.

33
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,410
What time does Joan Rivers come on?

34
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:13,500
She doesn't.

35
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,280
This is a church, and it's not your church.

36
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,570
New Testament?

37
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,000
Oy-yoi-yoi, when did this happen?

38
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,850
Alexa, play Tranquil Organ Radio.

39
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,750
Peace be with you.

40
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,450
And also with you.

41
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,520
Oh, you can do better than that.

42
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,850
We can, but we don't want to.

43
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,150
I can't hear you.

44
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,930
You clearly can.

45
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,910
Lord, either make this interesting

46
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,040
or just rapture me now.

49
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,640
Salt the ham water, boys.

50
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,430
Clancy Wiggum is meeting his quota.

51
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,150
Hey! That's illegal.

52
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,910
Oh, sorry. You know what?

53
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,480
Here. Have a quarter, Chief.

54
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,210
You think you can bribe me with a...? Oh, my God!

55
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,470
Those are the gentlest eyes I've ever seen.

56
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,930
Linen shirt. Natural highlights.

57
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,400
You want to hold my gun?

58
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,010
Y-You can.

59
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,250
Thanks. I was hoping maybe you could point me

60
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,230
to the church in town.

61
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,070
Church? Yeah, straight down this street. First steeple you see.

62
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,980
That is not it. That's the Eiffel Tower strip club.

63
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,030
They have a French onion soup that is,

64
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,560
uh, well, it's just okay.

65
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:30,720
And I guess

66
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,150
that's about all.

67
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,360
You shall bore me no more!

68
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,870
You're going the wrong way!

69
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,060
No, I-I want to go this way. I love God.

70
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,260
If you love him so much, why don't you marry him?

71
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,840
Penny. Button.

72
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,800
IOU for one penny.

73
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,300
Hi. Bode Wright.

74
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,330
Recovery meetings are downstairs.

75
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,550
Booze to the right, huffers to the left.

76
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,940
Sorry, I'm here about the ad. On Christslist?

77
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,840
About you guys needing a-a youth pastor?

78
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,400
I didn't place any ad.

79
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,560
I placed the ad.

81
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,360
- I'm Bode. - Bode. Nice cross.

82
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,000
Tim's are chewed to nubs.

83
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,760
I-I chew my crosses. Nervous habit.

84
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,480
Do you have any experience, Bode?

85
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,610
I used to work in Michigan.

86
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,620
Had to use bottled holy water.

87
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,890
Education?

88
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,690
I, uh, have a master's in divinity

89
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,190
with a focus on biblical languages.

90
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,120
- Greek, Hebrew... - You're hired.

91
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,150
Up-bup-bup-bup-bup! It doesn't work that fast.

92
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,710
We have I-9s and W-2s, collar fittings.

93
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,360
And, besides, I'm the one in charge.

94
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,140
In the end, isn't God in charge here?

95
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,240
Do you see Jimmy Buffett at every Jimmy Buffett café?

96
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,790
I don't think so.

97
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:42,690
Hey, can I have this?

98
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,300
Marge could use it to serve me snacks while I'm on the toilet.

99
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,340
Oh, just take it.

100
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,870
So, Bode, do you have anywhere to stay?

101
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,260
Not yet. I saw a motel by the tire fire.

103
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,350
- He'll stay with us. - No way.

104
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,140
Uh, Reverend? The homeless are here for their foot washing.

105
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:05,300
I'm looking for a mani-pedi and an eyebrow wax.

106
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,910
I guess I could use a little help around here.

107
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,510
Thank you. I won't let you down.

108
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,820
We don't hug here.

109
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,750
Uh, I'm here for the Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

110
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,310
It's usually me, Lenny, Carl, Bumblebee Man, Kent Brockman.

111
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,570
But don't tell anyone.

112
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,810
Downstairs to the right.

113
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,330
Also, Lunchlady Dora, King Toot,

114
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,990
and a man I'll identify as Disco S.

115
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,110
Disco S is quite a mess.

117
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,270
Oh, Marge, this is embarrassing.

118
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,800
We don't need counseling.

119
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,420
We do need counseling.

120
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,280
I'm carrying a lot of anger.

121
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,270
Just do what I do. Come home

122
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,350
and have a hot dinner waiting for you.

123
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:53,990
Well, let me just say that I go into this with no preconceptions.

124
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,200
Now, tell me, how is this Homer's fault?

125
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,530
He sold our home without telling me.

126
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,450
Helen, is he playing with my damn trains?

127
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,140
Excuse me. There's trouble down at Lovejoy Junction.

128
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,170
So, we're good?

129
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,410
We're good if we get our house back.

130
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,410
Did you say houseboat?

131
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,050
House back. House back!

133
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,910
Sorry, Reverend. I'm trying to get some rest?

134
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,510
The 12 to down Trenton doesn't stop

135
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,670
just because your fat head's on the track.

137
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,790
- What are you doing? - Nothing.

138
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,970
- You gonna drop that? - Not doing a thing.

139
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,990
As a gag, you're gonna drop a tiny log on my face?

140
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,600
- Nothing. - As I'm sleeping? That's, that's-that's funny.

141
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,060
- Nothing. Nothing. - Go ahead. Drop it.

142
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,300
- Drop a tiny log on me. - Not doing a thing.

143
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,560
Is that... Is that your plan? You're gonna drop that?

144
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,530
Look, we're both grown men here.

145
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,270
Now leave my choo choo alone.

146
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,070
Gladly.

147
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,320
Glad I finally got to use that.

148
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,230
Now, my sleepy, young friend,

149
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:01,670
I don't know how you did things back in "Michigan."

150
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,960
Air quotes are for when something's not a real thing.

151
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,750
But in my parish, we minister to our flock.

152
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,350
And I'm not afraid to say the hard things that need to be said.

153
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,150
"I" 27.

154
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,890
- What? - What did he say?

155
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,440
We can't hear you.

156
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,400
"B" Thr-three.

157
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,510
You know, I'd be happy to yell out numbers for you.

158
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,580
Help save your voice.

159
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,500
Bingo requires a firm, experienced caller.

160
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,300
"G" "G" 48.

161
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,310
"N" Four... "N" 43.

162
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,360
I got nothing.

163
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,910
I think I can handle it.

164
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,380
When I was in seminary school,

165
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,290
I was the shouty guy on our rowing team.

166
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,770
We weren't allowed to say "Coxswain."

167
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,620
Bingo is not for newbies.

168
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,330
The letters sound very similar.

169
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,710
"B" 15.

171
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,460
"B" as in Balthazar.

172
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,560
Did he say Galthazar?

173
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,510
Gingo!

174
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,420
Gingo take you to bathroom.

175
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,390
I don't want to go.

176
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:01,430
Hey, this no picnic for Gingo either.

177
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,420
Empty again.

178
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,050
And those two just came here to make out.

179
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,840
If we do it in a church, I, like, can't get pregnant.

180
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,770
Uh, good mor...

181
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,080
Excuse me.

182
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,860
Brothers and sisters,

183
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:32,710
Reverend Lovejoy is experiencing some vocal difficulties.

184
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,330
Save your voice, Reverend.

185
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,580
Now, we could cancel church.

186
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,560
But God clearly foresaw this

187
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,280
and sent us a backup pastor to finish the service.

188
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,160
Church will not be canceled.

189
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:01,720
Now please help me welcome our new youth minister Bode Wright.

190
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,000
Thanks. That's very meek. Jesus would've loved it.

191
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,680
I was thinking, while the reverend rests his voice,

192
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,230
maybe we could all sing a song.

193
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,040
Uh, Rev, if that's okay with you, um, cough once.

194
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,480
We did not establish what two coughs means,

195
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,530
so I'll take that to mean two yeses.

196
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,380
Why don't we sing, I don't know,

197
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,090
"Amazing Grace"? You all know that one.

198
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,670
Or if you don't, it's in your hymnal under

199
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,430
"Grace, comma, amazing."

200
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,110
*Amazing grace, how sweet the sound*

201
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,840
*That saved a wretch like me*

202
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,810
*I once was lost but now I'm found*

203
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,700
*'Twas blind, but now I see.*

204
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,810
This is the most exciting thing that ever happened

205
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,600
in a white church!

206
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,060
All these years of mediocre grace.

207
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,380
Finally, it's amazing.

208
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,360
This must've been what it was like

209
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,260
at Jesus's concerts.

210
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,980
Thank you. Now we'd,

211
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,320
we'd like to do a couple of new psalms.

212
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,890
- *Hallelujah, hallelu* - *Hallelujah*

213
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,470
*Hallelujah, hallelu*

214
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,800
*Hallelujah*

215
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:20,670
Something exciting's happening at the church.

216
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,150
Let's check it out.

217
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,360
All right, I think we get it. Grace, it's amazing.

218
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,660
I know most of you usually save your "Hallelujahs"

219
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,010
for when church is over.

220
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,520
I adore the informality.

221
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,520
But if it's okay, I thought maybe I could just speak

222
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,760
to you guys straight from my heart.

223
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,880
I don't have anything planned,

224
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,730
but I guess I should talk about God, right?

225
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:40,970
Church. Pastor.

226
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,760
Makes sense I should talk about God.

227
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,400
But the truth is, I woke up this morning

228
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,750
and I wasn't really sure if I believed in God.

229
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:48,910
No God?

230
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,070
Fingers in your ears, boys.

231
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,460
Till you can feel the brain.

232
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,210
It's okay. Everything's fine.

233
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,610
I-I just woke up with some doubt.

234
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,530
Like many of you did, too, I'm sure.

235
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,130
There's so much pain and suffering in the world,

236
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,490
I wasn't sure anyone was really out there.

237
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,070
Watching us. On a cloud.

238
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,340
That's how we think of God, right?

239
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,560
To many of us, God is just an angry, old miser

240
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,530
with a killer surveillance system.

241
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,720
Everyone picks on the miser.

242
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,930
Shave faster or no tip!

243
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,540
I shave-a faster, all right.

244
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,350
Hurry up. I'm going to a funeral.

245
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,090
You're going to a funeral, all right.

246
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,290
This is taking too long.

247
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,930
I got to stop procrastinating.

248
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,970
Then I got quiet and thought about it.

249
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,610
It hit me that maybe God isn't up there, you know.

250
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:31,460
"Somewhere else."

251
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,220
Maybe God's right here and now.

252
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,880
As close as the air on your skin.

253
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,130
For the first time ever, I don't feel alone.

254
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,620
Life is worth living.

255
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,170
Hey, forget that hit I called on myself, huh?

256
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,810
Yeah, well, I said too late.

257
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,200
Can't you just charge me a stalking fee?

258
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,490
Okay, 40%.

259
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,760
And you can only cancel on the app.

260
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,530
All right, I-I'll just, uh...

261
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,290
My screen is frozen!

263
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,950
Maybe God is just a word for a love

264
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,930
that we create and remember together.

265
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,030
A love that isn't mad at us for our doubt

266
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,650
or angry at us because we're alcoholics.

267
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,540
Finally, recognized for my accomplishments.

268
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,840
I think so many of us have made a God that's like us,

269
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,360
instead of the other way around.

270
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,710
God loves diversity.

271
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,480
God didn't just make one type of flower.

272
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,800
He made thousands of different flowers--

273
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,600
roses, lilies, orchids--

274
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,930
and He made the weeds, too.

275
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,350
But He loves all of them indiscriminately.

276
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,400
Just like the bees.

277
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,040
You have made this bumblebee a humble bee.

278
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,510
Jesus said, "Let the weeds grow with the wheat."

279
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,220
That means it's all in the game.

280
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,360
Go easy on yourself.

281
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,400
You don't have to earn God's love.

282
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,140
You are God's love.

283
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,160
All right, that's it.

284
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,100
I know it's early, but it's a beautiful day.

285
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,230
Let's get out of here.

287
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,280
Sorry, concert's over, dude.

288
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,960
All that's left is the merch.

289
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,190
Bode! Bode! Bode!

290
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:51,460
Bode! Bode! Bode!

291
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,290
Three cheers for Reverend Lovejoy.

292
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,610
Stupid Flanders.

293
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:58,350
Stupid Flanders! Stupid Flanders!

294
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,000
I love church.

295
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,220
I won't be single in Heaven.

296
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,200
This was the best church ever.

297
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,670
It was like some kind of religious experience.

298
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,550
Will you join us for pancakes?

299
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,940
Are those new vestments?

300
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,540
They really bring out the piety.

301
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,670
You don't have to patronize me, Ned.

302
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,160
You're, y-you're right, I'm sorry.

303
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,180
Y-You did not do well today.

304
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,430
Oh, go back to patronizing.

305
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,810
Maybe something about my shoes?

306
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:28,600
Oh, look at those shoes, tied so tight with loops so even.

307
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,970
Someone knows the bunny ear technique.

308
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,180
Helen tied them.

310
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,320
Uh, Pastor, would you like to say grace?

311
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:37,700
Lord--

312
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,530
Oh, sorry, I should have been more specific.

313
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,040
I meant the cool new pastor everyone likes.

314
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,900
You can sit down.

315
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,240
You know, I think the food is good

316
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,730
without me saying it's good.

317
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,830
God made it good.

318
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,870
Don't get me wrong, it's nice to be thankful, but

319
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,720
there's no need to make everyone uncomfortable

320
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,720
by praying in front of 'em, am I right?

321
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,690
Nice speech, although longer than grace.

322
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,880
Oh, no bacon for me.

323
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,380
I'm a vegetarian.

324
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,980
And, actually, a Buddhist.

325
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,310
Great. I love Buddha.

326
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,560
That's where I got my name.

327
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,540
The Bodhi Tree.

328
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,670
And I don't eat meat either.

329
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,160
You're a vegetarian?

330
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,080
- What about evolution? - Into it.

331
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,480
- Gay rights? - Love is love.

332
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,620
Dizzy or Bird?

334
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,540
John Coltrane and Duke Ellington, 1962.

336
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,670
The only way to describe how perfect

337
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,330
that jazz answer is, is with jazz.

338
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,730
This brunch has turned into...

339
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,870
a jazz brunch!

340
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,710
I'm a believer.

341
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,540
That's great, Lisa, but I actually don't think

342
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,540
faith comes down to what we believe.

343
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,750
Well, you got to believe in this baloney.

344
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,250
That's how you get into Heaven.

345
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,470
Where maybe, just maybe, I could see

346
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,330
the mother that abandoned me again.

348
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,680
Yeah, sure, but I think together

349
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,280
we can bring Heaven here while we're still alive.

350
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,630
There's a Chinese proverb about Heaven and Hell.

351
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,440
They say Hell is a long table like this, full of food,

352
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,150
but everybody's starving because they have these long chopsticks,

353
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,950
like pool cues, and they can't bring the food to their mouths.

354
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,340
This is the worst Year of the Ox ever.

355
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:11,010
But in the proverb, Heaven is the exact same table, same food,

356
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,620
same long chopsticks, but everybody's happy and fat

357
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,230
because they're feeding each other.

358
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:19,680
Wait, wait! I can be cool, too... with humor.

359
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,810
Did you hear the one about the Greek-Jewish wedding?

360
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,900
They didn't know whether to break the plates or the glasses!

362
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,980
Yes, why don't you take your cultural insensitivity

363
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,240
back to the Spanish Inquisition you came from?

365
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,100
I've lost them.

366
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,690
You never had us.

368
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,930
Timothy, the church council wants to thank you

369
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,910
for your many years of...

370
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,370
Incompetence!

371
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,650
Knock his frock off.

372
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,040
We like the new guy in his tight jeans.

373
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,280
Do not resuscitate your career.

374
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,360
What are you saying? You're firing me?

375
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,020
- Gingo. - Please surrender your cross.

376
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,440
We don't want any trouble.

377
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,610
Timothy.

378
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,590
Now the collar.

380
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,110
And any water you turned into holy water

381
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,260
is once again regular water.

382
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,490
Nothing but tap.

383
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,150
Did you know Bode has 22,000 YouTube subscribers?

384
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,710
Our church could go viral.

385
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:32,200
Ugh. Close window.

386
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:34,390
- You just subscribed. - What? No.

387
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,940
Now you gave him a thumbs-up.

388
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,460
Stop telling me what I just did.

389
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,580
You just gave him an eggplant emoji.

390
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,960
Well, at least that can't be misconstrued.

391
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,940
Wait a minute.

392
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,630
The Internet can help me. Help me find something on him.

393
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,160
He's clean on Google.

394
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,580
I'll have to try Bing.

395
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,360
Sorry, I was asleep.

396
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,460
Do you really want to use us?

397
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:54,380
Yes.

398
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,190
Hmm. Nothing.

399
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,880
But I'm not licked.

400
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,240
Pack your bags, Helen.

401
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,320
We are going to Michigan.

402
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,680
Reverend? We're here for a little counseling?

403
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:09,650
Well, I'd be happy to.

404
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,940
But you're already with the best counselor there is.

405
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,650
Your partner.

406
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,270
Wait. But Marge always told me

407
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,510
communication is bad for a marriage.

408
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,250
I said it was good.

409
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,420
You said what was good?

410
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,670
You just have to know what it's like

411
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,230
to be in each other's shoes.

412
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,010
Literally. Put on each other's shoes.

413
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:24,740
Right now.

414
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,300
All right then.

415
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,130
Your shoes are so tight.

416
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,940
And you do so much work.

417
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,530
You're an angel.

418
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,240
And your shoes are so heavy.

419
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,870
I never realized you carried around so much.

420
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:44,230
I'm starting to see the man I fell in love with again.

421
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,440
Where? Where? I'll kill him!

422
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,760
You.

423
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,910
I must admit, this is amazing.

424
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,260
But what about the fact that he sold our house?

425
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,480
- Um, may I interject? - Sure.

426
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,400
I've seen your house. It'll never pass inspection.

427
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,310
- Are you sure? - Piece of crap.

428
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,810
Thank you, Reverend.

430
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,460
Lisa. What brings you here?

431
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,120
Well, I thought it might be fun if we meditate together.

432
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,330
Sure. Make yourself at om.

433
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,440
Wow! As meditation jokes go...

434
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,270
That's the only meditation joke I've ever heard.

435
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,700
Alexa, play Meditation Jam.

436
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,500
You know, science calls it consciousness,

437
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,300
the mystics call it a soul, but both are just words,

438
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,090
just labels, for whatever it is

439
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,760
that's looking out your eyes right now.

440
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,750
Breathe, Lisa.

443
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,740
Saw the button, huh?

444
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,580
I did.

447
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,600
Tim, we could go to Mackinac Island.

448
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,270
They have the longest hotel porch in the world.

449
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:42,170
It's always the big verandas with you, isn't it, Helen?

450
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,630
You've done something to this town

451
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,230
I never thought could happen.

452
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,810
A full-blown religious revival.

453
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,470
Yeah, let these warm your insides

454
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,120
as the words of St. Paul warm your soul, there.

455
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,110
Dear Ephesians--

457
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,300
and I'm, of course, paraphrasing here--

458
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,790
believe in Christ or I'll hit your head with a baseball bat.

459
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,100
I'll frickin' do it.

460
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,590
Amen.

461
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,780
Hey, I'm-I'm not trying to change any minds.

462
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,120
I'm just trying to start a conversation.

463
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,190
We need that. This town's like a snow globe.

464
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:17,720
It doesn't look like much till you shake it up a little.

465
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,530
I want redemption or else, dude.

466
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:22,930
Or else what?

467
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,980
Or Rabbi Mankiewicz will, dude.

468
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,720
And I have trouble making that "Cch" Sound.

469
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,990
It's either Chanukah or Hanukkah.

470
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,720
Okay? Pick one of those.

473
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,180
Teach a man to microfiche,

474
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,030
and you'll feed him dirt for a lifetime.

475
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:47,990
Vengeance is mine, sayeth the me.

476
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,790
We really should've digitized that stuff.

478
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,370
Oh, I hope part two is about my rescue.

480
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,530
Next week on "Warrin' Priests Part Two..."

481
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,430
I hear there's a little dirt

482
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:18,290
on the collar of a man who used to preach here,

483
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,160
Bode Wright.

485
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,640
You, sir, have challenged me on scripture.

486
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,080
Oh, well, if it's scripture you want to talk,

487
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,970
then let us make a joyful noise unto the Lord.

489
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:30,920
Good.

490
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:36,280
Yarr, activism means nothing if it's not intersectional. Yarr!

491
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,910
Next week on The Simpsons.
