22
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,130
你们谁也不会继承到任何东西
None of you will inherit anything.

23
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,920
因为本来就没东西传下去
Because there isn't any.

25
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,070
辛普森一家前情提要
Previously on The Simpsons,

26
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,040
一位颇具魅力的新牧师来到春田镇
a charismatic new preacher came to Springfield.

27
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,030
你要拿我的枪吗  你可以拿
You want to hold my gun? Y-You can.

28
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,750
丽莎前所未有地崇拜他
And Lisa admired him like no adult man she'd ever met.

29
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:42,410
这顿早午餐已经变成爵士风味了
This brunch has turned into... a jazz brunch!

30
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,010
勒弗乔伊神父失去了工作
Reverend Lovejoy lost his job

31
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,660
并发誓要报仇
and swore revenge.

32
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,830
接下来是
This is...

33
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,270
{\an8}向神父宣战
第二部

34
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,740
{\an8}春田第一教堂
三个恶霸当男仆
好处多多

35
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,330
这个新牧师太赞了
This preacher is so amazing.

36
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,870
我很期待这场布道
I'm looking forward to this.

37
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,330
这是我第一次没有以大型蒙太奇的方式
This is the first time I've come to church

38
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,380
出现在教堂现场
when it's not part of a big montage

39
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,660
我的敌人们也没杀掉
of my enemies being whacked.

40
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,470
有人为了来教堂特意打扮了一番
Well, someone looks awfully nice for church.

41
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,580
你说这个
Oh, this thing?

42
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,760
你确定你不是被
Are you sure you aren't just attracted

43
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,680
我们帅哥新牧师吸引了吗
to our handsome new pastor?

44
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,500
傻瓜  妈咪不会被牧师吸引的
Silly. Moms aren't attracted to pastors.

45
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,900
这地方真拥挤
Oh, this place is so crowded.

46
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,930
我的腿都碰到苗浩斯老爸的腿了
My leg is touching Milhouse's dad's.

47
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,720
看来我们是邻膝了哈老兄
Looks like we're knee neighbors, huh, buddy?

48
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,660
史密瑟斯先生
Mr. Smithers.

49
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,370
我从没见过你不跟在伯恩斯先生后面
I don't think I've ever seen you without Mr. Burns.

50
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,290
伯恩斯先生在家更舒服
Oh, Mr. Burns is more comfortable at home

51
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,190
读着他《圣经》的各种版本
reading his copies of the scriptures.

52
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,240
"赐福穷人"
"Blessed be the poor"?

53
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,950
我现在才知道这句话
I'm just finding this out now?

54
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,490
谁也不准知道
No one must know.

55
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,830
灰常好
Exellus.

56
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:12,870
早上好
Good morning.

57
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,750
早上好
Good morning.

58
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,100
对那些喜欢橄榄球比赛的人来说...
For those of you interested in the Packers game...

59
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,770
我们不想知道
We don't want to know.

60
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,480
我知道你们中有些人对我还有些疑问
So, I know some of you still have some questions about me.

61
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,900
我算一个
I certainly do.

62
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,600
你愿意当我儿子的教父吗
Will you be godfather to my son?

63
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,230
我们还没到那步呢  梅尔
We're not there yet, Mel.

64
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,570
但是说真的  越来越少有人来教堂了
But, seriously, fewer and fewer people are coming to church.

65
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:31,990
人数在减少
Numbers are declining.

66
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,160
我也很理解
And I get it.

67
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,330
当你告诉别人你相信上帝
When you tell people that you believe in God,

68
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,580
通常他们都以为你的意思是
usually they take that to mean

69
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,830
你是在无声地批判他们的生活方式
that you're quietly judging their lifestyle

70
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,650
或是以为除你之外的所有人都会下地狱
or think everybody but you is going to Hell.

71
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,450
就会说教  贱人
Way to preach, bitch.

72
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,990
我就假装自己听到的是"阿门"
I'm gonna pretend I heard "amen."

73
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,530
放轻松  贱人
Oh, relax, bitch.

74
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,260
宗教原始的功能
The original function of religion

75
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,390
就是让所有人团结在一起  宗教
was to bring us together. "Religion."

76
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,140
宗  就像是韧带
"Ligio," like "ligament."

77
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,890
意思是重新联系
It means to reconnect.

78
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,600
在医学院可不会教这种东西
They don't teach you that at medical school.

79
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,680
不  教的
Yes, they do.

80
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,150
我在我的错误中吸取了教训
Well, I learn from my mistakes.

81
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,010
不熟不能生巧
Malpractice makes malperfect.

82
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,940
我想让我们所有人团结在一起
Well, I want to bring us all together.

83
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,650
不止是基督徒  还有印度教徒和佛教徒
Not just Christians but Hindus and Buddhists.

84
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,230
甚至是那些不信教的人
Even those that don't believe.

85
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,070
除我之外还有没有人
Does anyone besides me

86
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,190
怀念教堂之前的样子
miss church the way it was?

87
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,940
好吧  蟋蟀赞同
Well, the crickets agree.

88
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,830
{\an8}我们说的是不

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,630
这座教堂已经从一个
This church has gone from a place

90
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,880
温暖  安静到尴尬的地方  变成了现在
of warm, awkward silence into a gooey lovefest

91
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,380
被你这个自恋的小子经营的网红地
run by a narcissistic kum-bah-yo-yo,

92
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,220
我绝对不能忍
and I will not stand for it.

93
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,090
你我信仰同一个上帝
You and I believe in the same God.

94
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,600
我只是相信  上帝爱所有人
I just believe that that God loves everyone.

95
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,100
你不赞同这个说法吗  内德
You don't agree with that, Ned?

96
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,430
先生  我们还没到直呼大名的程度呢
Sir, we are not on a first-name basis.

97
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,560
弗兰德斯先生
Mr. Flanders.

98
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,400
你何以叫我内·新福音执事·德
You may call me New Evangelical Deacon,

99
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,550
或者简称为内德
or Ned for short.

100
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,900
好的  内德
Okay, Ned, look,

101
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,570
上帝就是爱  有了他才让宇宙开始运行
God is the love, the "yes" that set the universe in motion.

102
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,180
他  或是她
He or She...

103
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,020
或许这一次
Maybe this time.

104
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,060
*或许这一次*
*Maybe this time*

105
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,030
*我会相信*
*I will believe it*

106
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:06,210
{\an8}周日  好衣服
周日  更好的衣服
周日  最好的衣服

107
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:06,610
*或许这一次  我会祈祷*
*Maybe this time, I will pray*

108
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,950
*或许这一次*
*Maybe this time*

109
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,250
*是第一次*
*For the first time*

110
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:20,250
*我会在周日找到乐趣*
*I'll have fun on Sunday*

111
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:33,890
*他会用那淡褐色的眼睛布道*
*He will sermonize with those hazel eyes*

112
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,480
*我有佛祖*
*‭I've got Buddha*

113
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,440
*我有科学*
*I've got science*

114
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:44,030
*第三个是耶稣*
*And now Jesus makes three*

115
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,780
*会实现的*
*It's gonna happen*

116
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,420
{\an8}欢迎

117
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,450

{\an8}欢迎

119
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,330
*或许这一次*
*Maybe this time*

120
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,710
{\an8}救赎过程不会对外播出

121
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,160
*我会祈祷*
*I'll pray*

122
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,680
不错  孩子  还有提升的空间
Not bad, kid. Also not good.

123
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,920
我来给你演示一下动作
Let me show you how it's done.

124
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,880
一哒哒  二哒哒
And a one, and a two.

125
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,280
在教堂里酣睡
Sleeping in church.

126
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,440
有其父必有其女
Like father like daughter.

127
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,650
上帝只不过是恩典和传教还有宽恕的结合体
God is nothing but grace and flow and forgiveness.

128
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:17,820
如果你不这样认为的话
And if you don't think so,

129
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,360
我不知道怎么办  也许你应该回去
I-I don't know, maybe you should go back

130
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,200
再稍微深入的研读一下《圣经》
and read the Bible a little bit closer.

131
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,280
你是在质疑
Are you questioning a man

132
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,570
一个把备用《圣经》放在旅馆房间的人吗
who travels with extra Bibles to put them in hotel rooms?

133
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,490
你介意离开吗
Do you mind?

134
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,130
我肯定你的虔诚
I'm sure you're very sincere,

135
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:34,620
这就像鹦鹉只会背诵《圣经》却不解文意
but a parrot can recite the Bible and have no idea what it means.

136
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,960
什么  什么  什么
What? What? What?

137
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,510
这里不再是教堂了
This isn't church anymore.

138
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,620
我们要走了
We're out of here.

139
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,970
爸爸  牧师没说走我们就不能走
Daddy, we can't leave before the pastor says so.

140
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,100
谁告诉你的
Who told you that?

141
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,100
是你啊
You did.

142
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,470
你把这个叫侯默·辛普森式磨炼
You call it "Homer Simpson-ing."

143
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,220
别把侯默·辛普森扯进来  蠢货
Yeah, don't Homer Simpson, you jerk.

144
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,900
{\an8}与此同时  密歇根州这边

145
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,160
{\an8}圣买大教堂
汉堡王中王

146
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:02,410
{\an8}复活节遭到除名的帅气牧师

147
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,560
这里就是他被开除的地方
This is where he got fired.

148
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,990
现在我们要开始探寻
Now we're gonna poke into

149
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,540
完美牧师先生的申秘过去
Mr. Perfect Pastor's pysterious past.

150
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,540
你刚才说的是申秘吗
Did you just say "pysterious"?

151
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,660
你能不能别跟我对着干
Can't you be on my side for once?

152
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,470
打扰一下  我们要找牧师
Excuse me, we're looking for the pastor.

153
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,810
我们没有牧师
Oh, we don't have pastors.

154
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:30,420
但是我们的触控向导有虚拟助手
But our touch screen directory does have a digital assistant.

155
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:34,440
您好  我是神牛  能为您做些什么
Hi, I'm Holy Cow. How can I help you?

156
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,510
请按住屏幕让我们获取您的指纹
Please give us your fingerprint by pressing this screen.

157
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:43,780
{\an8}我们为什么来到这里  可以同性恋吗
泊车核准  根据错误程度排名的其他信仰

158
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:44,190
您什么都没点  试试吧
You haven't pressed anything. Why not?

159
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,330
{\an8}坏的好心人  好的好心人
升天
比特币支付  每月自动扣费

160
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:50,620
我想和介于你和上帝之间的人对话
I'd like to speak to someone below God and above you.

161
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,780

麦克牧师  有两位客人想见您

我想与您讨论一件不甚愉快的事
I'm here to discuss a matter of some unpleasantness.

176
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,880
你们不会是《波士顿环球报》的人吧
You're not here from The Boston Globe, are you?

177
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,010
{\an8}逃生包

178
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,090
不不不不不  我也是一名牧师
No, no, no, no, no. I'm a pastor, too.

179
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,010
我是为了了解一位曾在这里
I'm here there's a little dirt on the collar

180
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,840
布道的人的丑闻来拜访您的

{\an8}帅气牧师在复活节被罢免

183
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,100
他  你最好坐下听我说
Him? You better sit down.

184
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,170
故事不长  但我很能添油加醋
It's a short story, but I'm gonna milk it.

185
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,170
我想接着讲
I would go on,

186
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:58,650
可我嗓子都快讲哑了
but I'm down to my last vocal cord.

187
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,480
即使在牧师里
even for a pastor

188
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:04,950
我说话也够绕圈子了
I've taken way too long to make a simple point.

189
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,690
好了  证据在这里
Now, here's the proof.

我天  在我的教区里有这么多单身的人
Oh, my God, so many singles in my area

192

{\an8}您教区里想与您见面的单身人士

193
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,860
想见我
want to meet me.

194
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,460
从属无关紧要
Possessions don't matter,

195
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,870
金钱无关紧要  这也无关紧要
money doesn't matter, this doesn't matter.

196
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,540
他烧的是我所想的那个东西吗
Is he burning what I think he's burning?

197
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,620
我抓住他的把柄了
I've got him now.

198
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:37,360

你在读《圣经》吗
Are you reading the Bible?

201
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,820
嗯  书不错  可是...
Yes, it's good, but...

202
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,320
我有几条标注
I have a few notes.

203
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,780
{\an8}种族主义者  性别歧视者  对赫梯人不公平  乱伦

204
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,070
我从没遇到过
Yeah, well I never met a Hittite

205
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,100
不想向埃及扩展疆域的赫梯人
who wasn't trying to expand his empire into Egypt.

206
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,740
赫梯人  比迦南人还糟
Oh, Hittites... worse than the Canaanites!

207
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,950
现在是谁为了新来的帅气牧师这么做啊
Now who's doing it because of the handsome new pastor?

208
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,330
莱特牧师
Reverend Wright?

209
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,110
你觉得他
You think he's...

210
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,870
我就不遮遮掩掩的了
Oh, why pretend?

211
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,590
他每句话  我觉得都是在说给我听
When he speaks, I feel like he's speaking only to me.

212
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:04,300
丽莎宝贝  我担心你陷得太深
Oh, Lisa, honey, I'm worried you'll get too attached.

213
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,960
任何新且独特的东西在这里都不会被接受
This town has a way of rejecting what's new and different.

214
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,040
好的东西也是
And better.

215
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,250
这次不一样
Not this time.

216
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,850
但看看你的愿景板
But look at your vision board.

217
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,800
全是令人心碎的失望
It's full of nothing but crushing disappointment.

218
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,270
{\an8}愿景板
我放弃  失败  坚持没用  你输了

219
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,570
连愿景板本身都这么逊
Even your vision board is a failure.

220
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,980
那钩子本该承担
That hook was supposed to hold

221
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,810
我一生失望的重量
a lifetime's worth of disappointment.

222
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,440
"土星汽车  退到我后面吧"
Get thee behind me, Saturn.

223
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,440
{\an8}引自圣经原文
"撒旦  退到我后面吧"

224
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,570
我得小便
I need to pee.

225
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,740
没时间  我们急着去剥下他那身牧师的皮
No time. We've got defrocking to do.

226
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,460
提姆  你这个样子我从没见过
Timothy, I've never seen you like this.

227
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,790
也许我也可以剥下谁的衣服
Maybe I'll do some defrocking, too.

228
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,800
在小火车房吗
In the choo choo room?

229
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,540
没兴致了
Okay, mood's gone.

230
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,640
两杯啤酒  老谋子
Two beers, Moe.

231
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,930
牧师什么都不要
Nothing for the reverend.

232
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,250
你好  牧师
Oh, howdy there, Rev.

233
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,420
不能让他看到我的裸女杯
Well, can't let him see my nudie glasses.

234
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,730
你没必要砸碎裸女杯
You didn't have to break your nudie glasses.

235
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,400
你说晚了  那帮我想想
Now you tell me. Uh, remind me--

236
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,220
一个女的有几个胸来着
how many boobs does a woman have?

237
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,320
我从未说过这么多心里话
I never got so much off my chest.

238
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,160
我曾垂涎过邻居的割草机
So, then I coveted my neighbor's riding mower.

239
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,870
我骑双人自行车从不踩踏板
I never pedal when I'm on a bicycle built for two.

240
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:19,570
-侯默  -我三十岁还在"不给糖就捣乱"
- Homer... - I went trick-or-treating when I was 30.

241
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,670
还有  我跟马姬说去做结肠镜检查
Also, I told Marge I was going for a colonoscopy

242
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:27,580
其实是看了《猩球崛起》系列
when I actually went to a "Planet of the Apes" marathon.

243
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,550
包括蒂姆·波顿那部
Including the Tim Burton one.

244
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,090
-上帝不会在乎的  -哈利路亚
- God doesn't care. - Hallelujah!

245
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,790
行行好别叫了  我还要在这谋生
Please. I make my living in here.

246
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,970
抱歉  那我被原谅了吗
Sorry. So am I forgiven?

247
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,680
你是个好人  侯默·辛普森
You're a good man, Homer Simpson.

248
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,060
抛开你所有的善恶行为
Behind all your behavior, good and bad,

249
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,230
你生命中仍有自在之地
there's a still, quiet place

250
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,900
未被生活的蹂躏所影响
untouched by the dramas of this life

251
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,190
在那片净土上你是善良的
where you simply "are" goodness.

252
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:49,070
我还没说最坏的那次
Oh, you haven't heard the worst one.

253
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,030
我对厕纸广告上的熊妈妈
I had impure thoughts

254
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:54,600
曾有过不洁的想法
about the mother bear in the toilet paper ads.

255
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,700
尊敬的牧师  如果你真是的话
Reverend? If that is your real honorific.

256
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,540
教区居民的拜访你要迟到了
You are late for our parishioners' visit.

257
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,570
我准备了一整天呢
I've been preparing all day.

258
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,360
抱歉  我得走了
Uh, sorry. I've got to go.

259
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,580
侯默  这个叫弗兰德斯的有没有惹过你
Homer, does this Flanders guy ever annoy you?

260
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,260
偶尔吧
From time to time.

261
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,880
动一动  动一动
Move it, move it, move it.

262
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,970
好的
All right.

263
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,080
你哪只手按的喇叭
Which arm did the honking?

264
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:31,350
才不告诉你
I'm not telling.

265
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,560
请进
Come in.

266
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:52,660
先生  你要跟我挑战谈论圣经
You,sir, have challenged me on scripture.

267
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,220
好吧  既然你想谈的是圣经
Oh. Well, if it's scripture you want to talk,

268
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,250
那让我们把欢呼献给上帝
then let us make a joyful noise unto the Lord.

269
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,420
-没问题  -好的
-Good. -Good.

270
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,430
惩罚是信仰的关键
Punishment is the key to belief.

271
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,930
马太福音25:46
Matthew 25:46.

272
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,020
"这些人要往永刑里去  但..."
"They will go away to eternal punishment, but the..."

273
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,350
"但那些义人要往永生里去"  没错
...righteous to eternal life." Sure.

274
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,810
但上帝的恩典是给每个人的
But God's grace is for everyone.

275
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,270
约翰福音12:32
John 12:32.

276
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,100
"我要使众人..."
"I will draw all people..."

277
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,650
"...都归于我"
"...up to myself." Hmm.

278
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,780
那听这个  帖撒罗尼迦后书1:9
What about 2 Thessalonians 1:9?

279
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,470
他们将遭受永远毁灭的惩罚...
"They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction..."

280
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,070
罗马书11:32
Romans 11:32.

281
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,530
他可以宽恕他们所有人
"He may have mercy on them all."

282
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,160
所有人
Them all.

283
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,160

284
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,050
创世纪3:23
Genesis 3:23.

285
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,670
于是耶和华把他从园中赶出去
"So the Lord banished him from the Garden."

286
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,790
创世纪1:31
Genesis 1:31.

287
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,630
上帝看到了他所创造的一切
"God saw all that He had made,

288
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,960
一切甚好
and it was very good."

289
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,840
我凉了
I'm cold, so cold.

290
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,690
我还穿了三件毛衣
And I'm wearing three sweaters.

291
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:57,690
{\an8}春田镇第一教堂
阿罗哈  星期天

292
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,980
要是夏威夷人民相信上帝
Wow. This is what it would be like

293
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,150
场面一定就像现在这样
if they believed in God in Hawaii.

294
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,690
牧师  你来我家吃晚饭吧
Reverend, you come to dinner at my house!

295
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:11,190
还是改天吧
Uh, yeah, I'm gonna take a rain check.

296
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,320
总说改天  改天是哪天
So many checks, so little rain.

297
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,370
停止这场狂欢
Stop this revelry!

298
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,130
你是谁
Who are you?!

299
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,090
勒弗乔伊牧师
Reverend Lovejoy!

300
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:25,500
我刚从密歇根州回来
And I'm just back from Michigan.

301
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,260
你能帮我怒指他一下吗
Can you point accusingly for me?

302
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,260
没问题
You got it.

303
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,510
这个人是个异教徒
This man is a heretic.

304
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,260
哦不  丽莎  别
Oh, no. No, Lisa, don't.

305
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,640
大家等一等
Wait, wait, wait!

306
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,910
我们当然知道牧师他收到上帝祝福...
Surely, we know the reverend is a blessed man who...

307
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,520
丽莎  我做过一些坏事
Lisa, I did something bad.

308
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,520
说真的  能有多坏
How bad could it be? Seriously.

309
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,320
看看你们
Well, look at you,

310
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,990
终于注意我了
finally paying attention to me.

311
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,420
简单说一下  停车场里有辆亮着灯的
One brief announcement: there's a red Honda Civic

312
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,670
-红色本田思域  -他们要没耐心了
- in the parking lot with its lights on. - You're losing them.

313
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,160
他烧了《圣经》
He burned the Bible.

314
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,720
天啊
Oh, boy.

315
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,270
太可怕了  你们说说看
That's appalling. I mean, come on.

316
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,890
赞美诗可不是用来烧的  是用来纹身的
Psalms are not for burning. They're for tattoos.

317
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,520
所以你让我很难受
So, you know, you sicken me.

318
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,400
我心里的声音告诉我这不是真的
Everything in my heart tells me this isn't true!

319
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,770
我知道在教堂里说这话很奇怪
I know this is a weird thing to say in church,

320
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,190
但我们需要证据
but we need proof.

321
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,600
我要求在所有人面前开听证会
I demand a full hearing in front of all of us!

322
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,290
听证会会有的
Oh, you'll get your hearing.

323
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,850
周二下午四点
Tuesday at 4:00.

324
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:27,150
又失了一个乐园
Another paradise lost.

325
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,500
丽莎  你真的搞砸了大斋期的第一个周日
Lisa, you're really bringing down the first Sunday of Lent.

326
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,500
{\an8}由大斋首日开始至复活节前日止  一共四十天

327
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,570
连吞火者都不开心了
Even the fire eater is sad.

328
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,840
信仰危机愈发严重
The crisis of faith grows

329
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:49,770
{\an8}牧师纵火

330
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,930
禁止其传教的支持率目前高达52%
as support for im-preach-ment is now at 52%.

331
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:45,330
可以用解雇解决纵火吗
Can you fight fire with firing?

332
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,130
我们该如何处理这位叛徒神父
What should we do with this Judas priest?

333
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,770
肯特·布罗克曼为您报道
This has been Kent Brockman talking,

334
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,090
闭口不谈
saying nothing.

335
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,150
{\an8}闭口不说不谈

336
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:57,570
{\an8}燃烧男子  伯德·莱特案受审
春田市政厅

337
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,200
欢迎各位  我们开始吧
Welcome, all of you. Let's begin.

338
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,610
为什么是她来主持
Why is she running this?

339
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,660
因为她不会激动过头
Because she won't get overexcited.

340
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,040
那我就会吗
And I will?!

341
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,660
而且《圣经》上说  "小孩要牵引他们"
And the Bible said, "A child shall lead them."

342
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,660
{\an8}出自《以赛亚书11:6》

343
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,000
正如佛祖所说
Well, as my Lord Buddha said,

344
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,500
"此三者不可久藏
"Three things cannot long be hidden.

345
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,660
日  月  真相"
The sun, the moon, and the truth."

346
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,170
他们怎么不把这话设成谷歌涂鸦
Well, why don't they make that a Google Doodle?

347
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,300
神父  你很关心《圣经》
Reverend, you're very concerned with the Bible.

348
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,550
那我们就来谈谈《圣经》
So, let us turn to that Bible.

349
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,370
尤其是那众多
Specifically, the very, very, many parts

350
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,590
谈及宽恕的部分
that speak about forgiveness.

351
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:37,900
{\an8}《约翰福音1:9》如果我们坦白罪孽  祂便会宽恕
《希伯来书8:12》我要宽恕其不义  忘怀其罪愆
《提摩太前书1:15·16》基督耶稣降世  为要拯救罪人
《路加福音23:34》耶稣说  父啊  赦免他们  他们不知道自己在做什么

352
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,150
妈  谢谢你缝了这些旗帜
And, Mom, thank you for sewing these banners.

353
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,070
我缝了那么久  你就说十秒吗
I did all that work for a ten-second bit?

354
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,870
他烧过  他承认了
He did it. He admitted it.

355
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,700
你还需要什么证据
What else do you need?

356
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,950
大家  证据更少我们都围攻过
We've mobbed for less, people.

357
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,650
对  还记得那个两只袜子颜色不同的人吗
Yeah, remember the guy with the two different-colored socks?

358
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,570
他从小镇溜走了
Ran his ass right out of town.

359
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,570
驱逐他
Banish him!

360
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,090
驱逐他  驱逐他
Banish him! Banish him!

361
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:02,010
珍惜他  珍惜他
Cherish him! Cherish him!

362
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:04,470
我知道还有一个长发表演家
I know another long-haired performer

363
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:07,560
宣扬着爱与和平的新哲理
who preached a new philosophy, peace and love.

364
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,010
人们一开始是站在他这边的
And the crowd was with him,

365
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,320
后来却完全转变了
but then they turned, hard.

366
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,760
那个人就是威利·纳尔逊
And that man's name was Willie Nelson!

367
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,760
{\an8}美国著名乡村摇滚音乐人

368
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:18,260
要我说  驱逐他  驱逐他
Well, I say, banish him! Banish him!

369
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,560
驱逐他  驱逐他
Banish him! Banish him!

370
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:22,430
好了
Stop!

371
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:26,280
我是来团结你们的  但我却让你们分裂了
I came here to unify you, but instead I divided you.

372
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,370
所以我打算离开了
So I'm leaving.

373
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:30,060
我只希望我所说的能与你们少数人产生共鸣
I just hope what I said resonated with a few of you.

374
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,610
比如丽莎  她可能会改变世界
Like Lisa, one who may change the world.

375
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,620
还有那位船长  他清醒得令人吃惊
And that Sea Captain guy. That dude is surprisingly woke.

376
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:41,410
如果激进主义不插手要它还有何用
Ya, activism means nothing if it's not intersectional. Yarr!

377
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,550
{\an8}春田镇市政厅

378

380
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,220
你是我遇见的第一个
You're the first minister I've ever met

381
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,290
我不想一巴掌扇过去的牧师
I didn't want to slap across the face.

382
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,550
很高兴与你相识
Glad to have known you.

383
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,090
我只想说  去死吧  圣经焚烧者
And I just want to say, rot in Hell, Bible burner.

384
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,300
很高兴与你相识
Glad to have known you.

385
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,270
-很高兴与...  -打住打住
- Glad to have... - Bup-bup-bup.

386
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,860
在我们家  没有烘肉卷
In my family, you don't say goodbye to someone

387
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,350
你是没法和一个你在乎的人道别的
you care about without a meat loaf.

388
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,850
还有西兰花
And broccoli.

389
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,070
你是在邀请我去吃晚餐吗
You-You're inviting me over for dinner?

390
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,450
如果你在看见我们吃饭后还喜欢我们
If you can love us after seeing us eat,

391
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,040
我们就知道你是真的喜欢我们
we'll know you really love us.

392
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,320
来吧  哥们  我们准备做烤圣经
Come on, pal. We're having roast Bible.

393
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,400
怎么了  玩笑开太早了
What? Too soon?

394
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,910
我想做个简单的祷告
I just want to offer this simple prayer:

395
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,840
亲爱的上帝  请让辛普森一家永不终结
Dear God, please let the Simpsons never end.

396
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,630
阿门

00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:30,390
还有  伯德  明天我得问你一个哲学问题
And, Bode, tomorrow I have to ask you a philosophical question,

398
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,170
我们在教堂见
so I'll see you at the church.

399
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,860
-阿门  -你刚刚去哪了
- Amen. - Where the hell have you been?

400

{\an8}春田第一教堂
陈旧管理模式中

{\an8}《偶然圣人》《普世基督》《你在天堂中遇到的五个混蛋》

402
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,480
你为什么要烧掉圣经
Why would you burn a Bible?

403
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,770
你怎么不烧本比尔·奥雷利的书呢
Why couldn't you burn Bill O'Reilly's books?

404
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,770
{\an8}美国记者  作家  政治评论员

405
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,780
他写了那么多书
There are so many.

406
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,030
我是想告诉人们上帝在你们心中
I was trying to tell people that God is in your heart,

407
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:49,070
而不是在过度建设的教堂或者书本里
not in a overbuilt cathedral or some book.

408
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,280
这座小镇读不懂潜台词
This town doesn't get subtext.

409
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,400
我们的国家公共广播电台直播摔跤
Our NPR station broadcasts wrestling.

410
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,080
这是个很凶残的扼颈招式
And that's an excruciating half nelson.

411
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,670
这就是传说中的"打脸"吗
Now, is that what's known in the lexicon as a "face stomp"?

412
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,790
是的  正是如此
Yes, yes, its.

413
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,580
本周是广播电台募捐周  请捐赠一份善心
This is NPR pledge week. Please give.

414
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,630
-你为什么要那么做  -我那时才19岁
- Why did you do it? - I was 19.

415
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:12,640
我目睹了人们是如何用圣经分裂和排斥他人
I saw how people were using the Bible to divide and exclude.

416
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,930
人们忙于对路线图顶礼膜拜
People were so busy worshipping a road map

417
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,710
却没有朝目的地努力前行
instead of trying to reach the destination.

418
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:18,840
你懂我的意思吗
You know what I mean?

419
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,900
你怎么不这么说呢
Well, why didn't you just say that?

420
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,360
这话在理  你也不用烧《圣经》
That was fine. No fire.

421
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,850
-我才19岁  -我现在8岁  我能明白
- I was 19. - I'm eight and I get it.

422
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:31,530
你说得对  从那天起我就后悔了
You're right. I've regretted it since the day I did it.

423
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:34,120
所以从那时起  我就在世界各地闲逛
So, since then, I've just wandered the world,

424
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,200
就像一个在间隔年的千禧一代
like a millennial on a gap year.

425
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,110
我明白  但你打算怎么说服...
I understand, but how are you gonna convince...?

426
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,880
{\an8}大象都震怒了  我们永不原谅
我曾信任过你们  地狱里的新公寓

427
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,530
我就对这小镇的开阔心胸满怀信心吧
I'll just have faith in this town's open heart.

428
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,300
我就确认下上面写的不是"我们原谅你"
I was just making sure it doesn't say "We forgive you."

429
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,800
-不是的  -除非是用红色写的
- It doesn't. - Unless they wrote it in red.

430
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,760
对  不是的
Yeah, no.

431
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,260
-不  不是的  -不是
- No, they didn't. - No.

432
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,630
-这块砖就是信息  -这就是我们镇的人
- The brick is the message. - Them's my people.

433
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,470
-是啊  -是啊
- Yeah. - Yeah.

434
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,340
我们要扔回去吗  你们的习俗是什么样的
Do we throw it back? What's your custom?

435
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:07,150
警长  这人的码表上还有十分钟
Uh, Chief, this guy still had ten minutes on his meter.

436
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,900
就在我理解了那人时  在我重新相信时
Just when I understood that guy, when I believed again,

437
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,730
在我信任人们时  他们就把他抓走了
when I believed in people, they took him away.

438
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,120
我失去了我的信仰  阿卢
I've lost my faith, Lou.

439
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,520
没事警长  你有漂亮的妻子和孩子  我没法...
Come on, Chief, you got a beautiful wife and kid-- I can't...

440
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,620
抱歉  我没法一本正经说这话
I'm sorry, I can't say that with a straight face.

441
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,110
你可以试试啊
Well, you could try.

442
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,960
我是  我在试了  抱歉
I am. I-I'm trying, I'm sorry.

443
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,340
抱歉  我再试试
I'm sorry. I'll maybe try again.

444
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,910
你有漂亮的妻子和孩子
You got a beautiful wife and kid.
