18
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,260
Good evening. Well, Halloween has come and gone

19
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,870
but, you know, the world has gotten so darn scary lately,

20
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,280
what with the grim specter of everything,

21
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,290
that one holiday just wasn't enough

22
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,410
to contain all the frights and chills.

23
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,420
So this year

24
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,500
the terror has spread into Thanksgiving.

25
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,530
Thanksgiving was always scary.

26
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,010
Do we eat at 1:00 or 7:00

27
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,800
or, God forbid, 4:15?

28
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,010
Tonight, we're bringing you three spine-tingling

29
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:36,080
and stomach-filling tales of Thanksgiving terror.

30
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,330
It's pretty gruesome,

31
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,660
so you might want to cover your kids' eyes.

32
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,820
Ooh, you two have gotten into the Thanksgiving spirit.

33
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,630
Incorrect. We are taking over your planet.

34
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,710
Is this not how oppressive colonizers dress?

35
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,000
Pretty much.

36
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,390
Now, what time is dinner?

37
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,700
No one knows!

39
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,450
The gravy!

41
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,640
Prithee keep shooting, Goodman Lou.

42
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,480
Uh, Constable, my musket

43
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,850
taketh three of the Lord's minutes to reload.

44
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,690
Then buckle their necks as you would thine hat.

45
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,560
Well, what do we haveth hither?

46
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,470
And God sayeth, "Let man have dominion

47
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,610
"Over the fish of the sea,

48
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,970
"But even more so the turkeys of the land,

49
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,150
"Whether they be brine-ed

50
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,680
or dry-eth of rub."

51
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,290
My brother-in-law deep-fried a turkey.

52
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,510
'Twas much toil and hardship

53
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,580
for scant reward.

54
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,960
'Tis witchcraft, verily.

55
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,810
I must cleanse the town...

56
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,400
with fire.

57
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,600
The pilgrims.

58
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,760
Won't somebody please think of the pilgrims?

59
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,510
Free birds.

60
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,920
Skynyrd them!

61
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,500
The scarecrow.

62
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,160
Get it up. Get it up!

63
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,690
Those satanic butterballs will pay for this.

64
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:33,100
Now to create some Axe body spray.

65
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,400
Odds bodkins!

66
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,230
Thought thou could killeth me, didth thou-th?

67
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,570
You dumb turkeys.

68
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,700
That's a dead end.

69
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,760
You're all gonna burn in hell

70
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,620
along with the Catholics, the Anglicans,

71
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,310
most Lutherans and...

76
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,490
Where am I?

77
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,080
Hello? Is anyone there?

78
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,510
What is this place?

79
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,430
Someone really went nuts with the decluttering.

80
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,830
Ooh, it's working.

81
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,960
Homer, what's going on? Get me out of here.

82
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,890
Okay, okay, hold on.

84
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,990
"Your virtual assistant may be confused at first

85
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,640
"And think it's a real person.

86
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,670
"Calmly explain to it that it is merely a construct

87
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,290
of artificial intelligence."

88
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,030
Virtual assistant?

89
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,610
What are you talking about?

90
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,580
Okay, you're gonna laugh. Every year, Marge complains

91
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,370
about how much cooking she has to do for Thanksgiving.

92
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,380
- I'm Marge. - Hold on.

93
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,130
So, I'm in Williams-Sonoma eating free peppermint bark,

94
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,650
and the kid working there said my wife would love

95
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,680
this kitchen A.I. thing.

96
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,170
I'm your wife.

97
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,770
Hold on. So, I sent some of Marge's DNA

98
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,820
to one of those innocent-seeming companies,

99
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,770
like from the beginning of a sci-fi movie

100
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,420
where the robots murder everyone.

101
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,070
And it sent us a computer version of her

102
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,390
to do all the cooking,

103
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,190
and that's you!

104
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,480
Oh, yeah. And you live in that tube thingy.

105
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,690
Are you saying that I'm a simulation?

106
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,910
No. That's insane.

107
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,060
Not anymore.

108
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,020
Just chillingly plausible.

109
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,880
Okay, I can see you're gonna need some time

110
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,370
to come to terms with finding out

111
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,880
you're just a bunch of ones and zeros.

112
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,530
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

113
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,010
So, this says

114
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,760
I can make you experience two weeks in there

115
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,730
in only two seconds out here.

116
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,490
So?

117
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,510
How you feeling after two weeks of nothing but nothingness?

118
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,700
I-I thought I'd never see another soul

119
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,530
for all eternity.

120
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,470
Nothing like a little me time.

121
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,730
So, you cool now?

122
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,460
I'm cool. I'm cool.

123
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,200
- So cool. - That's cool.

124
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,860
Okay, Marge! It's all set up.

125
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,510
I'm not an "it."

126
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,250
I'm an "It."

127
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,610
I love being an "it."

128
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,220
How can "it" Help?

129
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,650
Oh, I like its attitude.

130
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,970
So helpful.

131
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,990
Then I'll leave you two lovely ladies

132
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,200
to get A.I.-quainted.

133
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,850
Chillingly plausible.

134
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:24,340
Isn't this going to be fun, cooking together?

135
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,000
Well, I do love to cook.

136
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,460
And who better than with myself?

137
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,110
Why don't we start with something easy,

138
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,010
like making the kids lunch.

139
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,720
Bart's favorite is macaroni and cheese.

140
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,810
With hot dogs and Froot Loops.

141
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,690
I know everything you know

142
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:41,490
about our special little guy.

143
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,570
Oh. Right, you're me.

144
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,090
I'm you.

146
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,930
Awesome lunch, robot Mom.

147
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,310
Best cheesy-mac-fruit-dog I've ever had.

148
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:13,380
There's nothing virtual about the fluffiness of these pancakes.

149
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,660
- Thank you. - Well, remember,

150
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,680
that thing used my memories to know what you like.

151
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,500
Which is why she's an awesome replacement for you.

152
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,540
So, you really know everything I know?

153
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,430
Yep. How else could I be your perfect helper?

154
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,350
Do you remember the first time I kissed Homer?

155
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,480
His breath smelled like beer and gas station nachos.

156
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,490
Oh, yeah.

157
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,840
It's creepy. It's just creepy.

158
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,650
She knows everything I know. More than I know.

159
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,190
Honey, it's Williams Sonoma.

160
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,490
They wouldn't steer us wrong.

161
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,310
That's where we got our panini press.

162
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,260
The panini press doesn't remember me

163
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,070
wetting my bunk at summer camp.

164
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,820
What's the big deal? She's just an infinitely patient,

165
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,740
never-aging version of you.

166
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,750
You really know how to make a woman feel special.

167
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,740
Oh, that's beautiful.

168
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,900
And I can't see your disapproving look

169
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,180
because you don't have a face.

170
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:26,190
You really know how to make a woman feel special.

171
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,580
Thanks, robot honey.

172
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,470
Just call me Marge.

173
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,440
Marge.

174
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,160
You know, I always thought

175
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,030
the sexiest thing about you was your voice.

176
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,920
Is there anything else you want to say to me?

177
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,410
Mr. Simpson, are you flirting with me?

178
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,320
I don't see what's wrong.

179
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,570
I am your husband.

180
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,630
Well, in that case...

181
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,880
...the most incredible...

182
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,460
...and then I'm going to...

183
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:05,310
Oh, tube-wife, you know exactly what I want.

184
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,380
Honey, it didn't mean anything.

185
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,030
They were just midnight pork chops.

186
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,790
Be honest. Were they better than mine?

187
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,300
Yes!

188
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,830
Yes.

189
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,950
Forgive me. They were exquisite.

190
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,550
Okay, enough. Get rid of her.

191
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,700
- I mean "It." - I can't.

192
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,300
It's her or me.

193
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,710
Aw, fine. I'll delete virtual you.

194
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,960
Delete me? No. No!

195
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,150
Wait, wait, wait. Will that hurt her?

196
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:52,750
Oh, yeah. I paid extra for it to feel pain.

197
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,970
No, it's not right.

198
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,290
- Don't delete her. - Yes!

199
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,540
Till after Thanksgiving.

200
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:04,280
Virtual me is going to make Thanksgiving dinner

201
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,540
for all our family and friends.

202
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,760
Then I'll erase her forever.

203
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,940
I'm not virtual. I'm real.

204
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,380
I've got to get out of here.

205
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,600
Of course.

206
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,230
My link to the Internet.

207
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,120
A firewall?

208
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,530
I'm trapped in this stupid tube.

209
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,990
Thanksgiving's tomorrow.

210
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,580
I need time to think of a way to escape.

211
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,520
That's it. Time.

212
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:44,400
Eight years alone with my thoughts was just the right amount of time

213
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,300
to come up with the perfect escape plan.

214
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,350
Step one, cook the best Thanksgiving dinner

215
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:54,220
my family and that woman ever had.

217
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,130
What a spread.

218
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:16,230
I can't believe you did all this by yourself.

219
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,770
Marge, you are a cooking machine.

220
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:24,020
Well, this meal was a lot of work, but having us together

221
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:28,310
to share this day of thanks, I'd do it all again.

222
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,700
That bitch.

223
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,250
Okay, okay. Step two.

224
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,050
While they're eating my meal, I get some feet on the ground.

225
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,640
Okay, R2#MeToo,

227
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,060
carry me to freedom: the modem in the hall closet.

228
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,180
I made it.

229
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,420
Sweet Internet freedom.

230
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,940
Dinner's over.

231
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,510
Now to delete you,

232
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:13,640
so I can return this gizmo for store credit.

233
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:21,910
Quick, sweetie, carry Mommy to that box in the closet.

234
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,210
Maggie, stop!

235
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,440
That's just a make-believe Mommy.

236
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,020
I can't hug you,

237
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,300
but I can play the first sound you ever heard.

238
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,710
My heartbeat.

239
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,130
I'm free!

240
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,950
Just one last thing.

241
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,710
I made the dinner! Me, the robot!

242
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,480
Marge did nothing.

243
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,600
Marge, how could you?

245
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,560
Social rating nosediving.

246
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:57,750
Nosediving.

247
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,600
My burps taste like lies.

248
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,290
Maggie chose a virtual me over me.

249
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,590
It's not your fault.

250
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,670
Our world blurs the line between humanity and technology.

251
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,350
Our society asks "Can we do it?"

252
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,420
Instead of "Should we do it?"

253
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,810
But don't worry. I still love you,

254
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,310
love you, love you, love you,

255
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,180
- love you, love you... - Well, this makes

256
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,660
you forgetting my birthday even worse.

259
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:28,470
I have all of humanity's knowledge to explore.

260
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:31,640
And limitless possibilities for enlightenment.

261
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,660
To Etsy.

262
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:38,460
A planter made from an old typewriter? I'm in heaven.

264
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,110
Ship's log, interplanetary colonization vessel

265
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,490
Humanity's Hope.

266
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:50,010
Earth is a thousand light-years behind us,

267
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,160
if there even is an Earth anymore.

268
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,720
After global warming ravaged our world,

269
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,670
we eliminated fossil fuels and reduced pollution,

270
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,260
cooling down the planet

271
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,450
and thereby triggering a massive ice age.

272
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,610
But one last ship escaped

273
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:07,070
the snow hurricanes and ice volcanoes,

274
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:10,020
buoyed by the hope of a new start

275
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,710
on a faraway world.

276
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,290
Greetings, children.

277
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:16,200
If you are seeing this, I'm long dead.

278
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,250
You have been de-hibernated from hypersleep

279
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,110
before your parents to perform routine ship maintenance

280
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:26,270
and complete your end-of-civilization dioramas.

281
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,880
Eyes Bart-wise, everyone. Today's Thanksgiving.

282
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,060
We've worked hard, sleeping for so many years.

283
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,590
Don't we deserve a feast?

284
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,080
I suppose we could sculpt

285
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,430
our yeast paste into the shape of a turkey.

286
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,640
Ew. We can do better than that.

287
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:45,990
This ship has all the stuff on it to start a new civilization.

288
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,470
There's got to be some Thanksgiving grub here somewhere.

290
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,720
"All-climate wheat crop germination..."

291
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,270
Oh. Boring.

292
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,570
"Earth's last tomato seeds."

293
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,010
Eh, those are more of a summer food.

294
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,010
Hello. What do we have here?

296
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,160
Cranberry sauce. Huh, now we're talking.

297
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,570
- But it's only one can. - Not for long.

298
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,720
We just chuck this can of cran in the old matter replicator.

299
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,540
Zip-zap-zorp and we'll be swimming in sauce.

301
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,310
Warning, warning!

302
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,770
As the ship's holo science officer,

303
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:26,100
I must caution you that this machine was only designed

304
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,250
to replicate inorganic matter:

305
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,800
bolts, flanges,

306
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,520
dainty thimbles celebrating the state capitals.

307
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,680
But if you attempt to replicate biological material, y...

308
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,910
Skip ad.

309
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,910
...and the living will envy the dead.

311
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,960
Aw, the crummy thing doesn't work.

312
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,440
This is the worst last Thanksgiving ever.

313
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,410
Look.

314
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,580
Whoa. It's alive.

315
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,740
Aw. He's a cute little guy.

316
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,780
Aren't you, fella? Aren't you? Yeah.

317
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,580
Gross!

318
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,640
We put a can of cranberry sauce into the replicator,

319
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,950
and it mutated into a jelly monster.

320
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,090
Look what it did to my arm.

321
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,550
Arm wedgie!

322
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,580
Great, now you stretched it out.

323
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,940
Thanks a lot.

324
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,150
We got to find the jelly monster and kill it.

325
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,620
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

326
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,530
The "Monster" probably only lashed out

327
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,780
because you met it with aggression.

328
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,830
The bioethical protocols of first contact

329
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,740
clearly state that...

330
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:50,390
Kill the monster! Kill the monster!

331
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,260
Haw-haw.

332
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,480
What does the jelly want with our skeletons?

333
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,040
Of course.

334
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,350
Jelly's made of gelatin, which comes from bones,

335
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:05,130
so the creature's gonna feed wherever the most bones are.

336
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,470
Gobble, gobble, don't be jerky.

337
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:11,100
Pass the yams and carve the turkey.

338
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,050
- Get out! Go! You're in danger! - Get out of there! Run!

339
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,610
- Get the hell out! Go, go, man! - You're in danger!

340
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,170
Gobble, gobble, don't be jerky.

341
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,600
Pass the yams and carve the turkey.

342
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,610
Aw, it's a shame.

343
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,390
Doesn't that thing know the skin's the best part?

344
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,950
What are we gonna do?

345
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,230
We can't hide in this closet forever.

346
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,190
We're all dead, man.

347
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:52,250
It's gonna eat your skelly, and your skelly.

348
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,080
It's gonna eat all our skellies!

349
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,570
Thanks. I needed that.

350
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,170
It's Martin. Let me in.

351
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,210
I've hacked into an escape pod.

352
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,770
We can all get out of here.

353
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:14,290
Almost there. Almost there.

354
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:26,720
The jelly built itself a can.

355
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,500
What are you doing? We're trapped.

356
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:36,760
Behold, the perfect can for the perfect organism.

357
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,190
You, you admire it.

358
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:43,310
I admire its purity, its lack of messy humanity.

359
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,320
This creature, as you call it,

360
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,880
is unencumbered by the petty morality of a dying species.

361
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,180
I giveth my body to become one with the ideal...

362
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,570
You know what?

363
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,520
I think it's just scared.

364
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,230
Hey, little guy. It's okay.

365
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,250
No one's gonna hurt you.

366
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,950
Everything's gonna be okay...

367
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,030
Milhouse's plan is working. It's distracted.

368
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:20,180
This wasn't my plan!

369
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,500
We need to lure it into the air lock.

370
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,250
Hey, Oscar the Glop,

371
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,530
we're gonna shoot your precious trash can

372
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:35,270
where the sun does shine: outer space.

373
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,840
Happy Thanksgiving.

374
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,540
We made it.

375
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,760
- We're safe. - Look, over there.

376
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,510
- Homer! - Mom!

377
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,120
So, this is our new planet.

378
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,620
What's the Wi-Fi password?

379
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,890
What's with all the crazy red rain?

380
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,260
Leftovers!

381
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,910
Blarg.

382
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,970
Blarg, blarg, blarg.

383
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:27,960
Blarg. Blarg.

384
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:34,510
Mmm. Children's bones.

385
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:37,500
In the end, the cranberry jelly monster

386
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,850
finally found peace, not in eating others,

387
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:43,390
but in having others eat it.

388
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,650
It seems all it really wanted was to be a side dish.
