19
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,650
I got few days left!

21
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,320
Hey, little lady.

22
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,770
You'd be a lot prettier if you smiled.

23
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,600
What? Who are you?

24
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,500
I'm a man. So I know what I'm talking about.

25
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,020
Smile and you'll be a lot more popular.

26
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,490
Are you serious? You know I'll remember this forever, right?

27
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,010
Well, that's what therapy's for.

28
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,630
And he told me I wouldn't be pretty unless I smiled.

29
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,040
Sweetie, you are very pretty.

30
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,240
And thanks to the puberty app on my phone,

31
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,050
we can see what lies ahead.

34
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,910
Wait. This can't be real.

35
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,440
I already had braces.

36
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,920
Oh. Well, I-I'm afraid you have to get them again.

37
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,260
The man we thought was your orthodontist

38
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,790
was actually a rogue periodontist.

39
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,470
Rogue periodontist.

40
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,760
This family cheaps out on everything.

41
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,650
Homer took me to a "Psychiatrist."

42
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,330
After three sessions, I figured out it was a goat with glasses.

43
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,420
Never went back.

44
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,280
Braces? Again?

45
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,970
Why am I the only one in this family who needs braces?

46
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,190
Don't look so smug, boy.

47
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,940
Let's try this app on you.

48
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,790
Hello, Aaron Eckhart.

49
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,570
Whoa-ho! Puberty!

50
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,890
Let's see what comes next.

52
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,040
Cool.

53
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,940
Homie, look. We got this in the mail today.

54
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,240
Aw, what is it?

56
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,330
Did I get drunk and buy useless stuff on eBay again?

58
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,050
Let's get more.

59
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,630
Hello, Simpsons.

60
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,860
It's me, Artie Ziff,

61
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,480
in prerecorded form.

62
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,370
So you can't talk to me.

63
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,280
I can't?

64
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,100
No, you can't.

65
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,150
Pause for laughs.

66
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,430
And thank you.

67
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,160
Artie Ziff? Isn't that the rich guy

68
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,770
who could have been our dad?

69
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:18,620
I am the only man your mother has ever been with,

70
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,010
and she doesn't have a single regret.

71
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,130
- Well... - You stay out of this, Marge!

72
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,050
Great news: I'm geg married, and you're invited!

73
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:29,300
Why, you ask, am I getting married?

74
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,790
I've found my s-o-u-l mate! Jealous?

76
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,870
April 12th, very rich man's wedding.

77
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,160
Regrets only.

78
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,290
Chicken or fish.

79
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,310
Or vegan.

81
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,010
Bye!

82
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,810
So, what else is in the mail?

83
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,800
We got a flyer from Lowe's!

84
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,060
Three-quarter plywood.

85
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,990
$20 a sheet!

86
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,290
I'm a-comin'!

87
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,560
Oh, I don't have a car.

88
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,420
You're not really thinking of going, are you?

89
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,520
That jerk kept trying to break us up.

90
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,670
Now, I am sensing conflicted feelings.

91
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,470
If you come, I promise you a wonderful time.

92
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,170
Champagne, caviar,

93
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,090
deep-fried ice sculptures, a guy who guesses your weight,

94
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,970
who always guesses low!

96
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,390
Thank you.

97
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,870
And now to celebrate, here's Tupac Shakur!

98
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,320
*Don't be tardy*

99
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,660
*My boy Artie is throwing a party*

100
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,690
*This wedding's gonna be fly*

101
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,450
*Why won't you people let me die?*

102
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,880
How do you turn this off?

103
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,140
There's no off to the Artie show.

104
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,010
- I decide when... - Please set me free.

105
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,170
Oh, here it is.

107
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,330
God bless you.

110
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,790
Now everyone's favorite: rinse and spit.

111
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:51,660
And I'm done... with the top braces.

112
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,380
We'll put booms in next week.

113
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,830
And after that, just a lifetime of wearing retainers.

114
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,660
Well, they're practically invisible.

115
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,950
I can't close my mouth.

116
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,250
The brackets are holding up your lips at the edges.

117
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,920
They'll adjust. The main thing is you're happy.

118
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,550
I'm not happy.

119
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,890
Have a little nitrous.

120
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:14,310
Oh, they should revoke your license. Ha!

121
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,200
More, please.

122
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,240
- That's enough. - No, it's not!

123
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,770
Yeah, give me that.

124
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:21,390
I thought your name is "Kidzrule."

125
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,620
Shortened from "Kidzrulovitch,"

126
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,420
which is Romanian for "Kill all the children."

128
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,770
That elevator has the capacity for 32 people!

129
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,530
We brought a rhino up here last week.

133
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,260
My headaches are so bad.

134
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,340
Jealous?

135
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,700
Feet.

136
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,550
You're one in a million.

137
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,830
Literally. Don't fall off the roof.

138
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,400
Homer Simpson!

139
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,060
The man who bet me to planet Marge.

140
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,270
You've done all right for a billionaire.

141
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,050
Hey, I'm not made of money.

142
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,620
Although, actually I am.

143
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,040
After my parole,

144
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,220
I got rich selling fireplace logs that look like cash,

145
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,270
i.E., Money to Burn.

147
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,050
That is the greatest.

148
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,550
It says "Money to Burn."

149
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,570
It looks like you're burning money!

150
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,000
Yes, that's the idea.

151
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,660
No, no, no.

152
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,860
It's so funny. Don't you get it?

153
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,460
Of course I get it. I thought of it.

154
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,390
No, no, no. Listen, it says "Money to Burn",

155
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,850
but it's actually...

156
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,100
I know! I know! Talk to someone else.

157
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,580
Hey, pal, you're a news guy. Give it to me straight.

158
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,400
Is this wedding on the level?

159
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,440
Here's the scoop. It's legit!

160
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,880
In other news, local newsman hopes to score with caterer.

161
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,080
This just in: she knows I'm married.

162
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,080
Coming up at 11:00: nothing.

163
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,510
Now, Homer, as this is a bachelor party,

164
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,100
I want to show you something.

165
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,780
But, uh, no word to the wives.

166
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,680
How did you meet your wife, by the way?

167
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,820
Usual: boy meets girl, girl meets bank account.

168
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,690
Now, shut your eyes.

169
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,520
You've never seen a body this enticing.

170
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,280
Exactly what I imagined!

171
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,090
Food coma. He'll be fine.

173
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,050
Hey, girlfriend!

174
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,870
Uh, who, me?

175
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,810
Lisa, did you get your eyebrows waxed?

176
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,590
You look amazing!

177
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,180
I don't have eyebrows.

178
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,780
Well, check out these twin caterpillars.

179
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,730
What's going on?

180
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,290
Her smile makes me feel full,

181
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,600
like I actually ate dinner last night.

182
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,590
If you never eat, how come you're so fat?

183
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,870
Americans can be fat and poor.

184
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,820
That's what makes us so great.

186
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,090
And so, after saving Wilbur,

187
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,360
Charlotte crawled off to die,

188
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,010
as all barn spiders do in the fall.

189
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,590
Bravo, Lisa.

190
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,410
What a positive note on which to end the class.

191
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,120
Positive? Positive?

192
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,010
Charlotte died alone at the saddest place on Earth,

193
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,210
an empty fairground.

194
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:26,270
Well, your smiling face made dying alone fun.

195
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,950
And believe me, that's where I'm headed.

196
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,660
So as long as I'm smiling,

197
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,130
it doesn't matter what comes out of my mouth?

198
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,690
Or your nose.

199
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,080
I don't need these anymore.

201
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,240
This'll go good in Willie's stew.

202
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,000
Can it really be that people are this shallow?

203
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,590
Lisa! Lisa! Lisa!

204
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,780
And am I shallow enough to enjoy this?

205
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,620
I am!

206
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,140
I'm so happy, I could sing!

207
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,790
*Hello, world!*

208
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,360
That really hurts with the braces.

209
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,270
- Take your pick. - What is it?

210
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,020
No idea. The labels are in Spanish.

212
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,070
- Hey, gorgeous. - Hey, Bart.

213
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,090
Lisa? Oh, yuck! I didn't know that was you.

214
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,110
It's the smile. It's totally changed how people see me.

215
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,340
Well, I just want you to know, you'll always be gross to me.

216
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,370
Oh, thank God. I was having doubts,

217
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,510
trying to figure out if this is sexist.

218
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,440
And then I found this.

221
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,340
It seems like ever since the pill,

222
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,120
the workplace has been full of single women.

223
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,930
Here's your coffee, Jim.

224
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,680
Extra sugar, just how you like it.

225
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,570
Hmm. Remind me to get a divorce.

226
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,810
But some women are having trouble "Fitting in."

227
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,070
Well, I can't figure it out, Jim.

228
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,270
I was all prepared for a big presentation,

229
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:13,070
but it went over like a nun at a go-go bar.

230
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,940
Well, there's one thing you didn't prepare,

231
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,300
and that's your face.

232
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,770
But I'm wearing a pound of Mary Kay.

233
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:21,090
Let me touch your body and show you the problem.

234
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,460
No need to ask.

235
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,630
You've got a secret weapon

236
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,750
sitting in the middle of your face.

237
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,050
Now you're sure to get that promotion.

238
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,020
Really?

239
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,040
No.

240
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,110
Ugh! Don't you see why I hate this?

241
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,540
'Cause you hate everything?

242
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,790
Because it makes that jerky old guy right!

243
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,520
I am more popular ‭because I'm smiling.

244
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,790
Told ya!

245
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,190
Wow. Not a single picture of Artie.

247
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,080
Maybe he has matured.

249
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,710
Well, I guess being here sort of ends a chapter in life.

250
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,300
So, lehayim.

251
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,860
That's odd.

252
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,650
Not one person from the bride's family.

253
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,340
Excuse me. We need someone walk with bride down the aisle.

254
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,100
Could you?

255
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,720
First, tell me one thing: how long is the aisle?

256
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,190
About 20 feet.

257
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,500
All right, I'll do it.

258
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,360
But double cake.

259
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,070
They grow up so fast.

260
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,100
I knew this day would come.

261
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,990
You'll always be my little girl. Mm.

262
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,880
If he hurts my baby, I'll kill him.

263
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:46,000
Oh, for crying out loud.

264
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,130
Friends, family,

265
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,300
I take great delight in informing you

266
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,950
that the bride and groom have written their own vows.

267
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,770
Stick to the script, amateurs!

268
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,140
Oh my god!

269
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,590
This is too weird.

270
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,030
Artie, you're the greatest lover ever,

271
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,870
when we made sex is so-so good.

272
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,270
I can't take this anymore.

273
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,510
We're getting out of here.

274
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,020
Yeah. This is really creepy.

275
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,690
Even the rhino's leaving.

276
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,980
You may now kiss the bride!

277
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,980
And this is a picture of us at our wedding.

278
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,440
You're so happy.

279
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,130
And here's us on our honey moon.

280
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:34,730
Two days in Ohio, and two days in Michigan, and boo-yah!

282
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:39,000
To Ontario for some international flavor!

283
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,020
I'm not happy.

284
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:44,000
I have a drawing of you saying that in Michigan.

285
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,770
This smile is so wrong.

286
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,410
There's nothing to be happy about.

287
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,430
The world's a mess, and so is this school.

289
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,400
I mean, how hard is this?

290
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,340
A happy girl put the thing in the hole.

291
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,850
Wait a minute, I could use my new power to change these things.

292
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,540
Use it for good!

296
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,700
Indubitably.

297
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,170
Hear, hear! Hear, hear!

298
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,900
I can make it happen.

299
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:28,520
Hurry!

303
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,570
You posers.

304
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,990
I was for Lisa before it was cool.

305
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,520
You never liked Lisa.

306
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,300
What? You got to remember that.

307
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,190
That's my one thing!

308
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:48,240
No. Your thing is crying you're punched.

309
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,460
Prove it.

310
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:54,620
Aw, you're taking all the fun out of it.

311
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,720
The polls are in, and you're doing great.

312
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,520
You're picking up the key group: girls who don't like Milhouse.

313
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,880
You're big with swing voters,

314
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,790
but the teeter-totters could go either way.

315
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,370
What about the kids on the slide?

316
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:05,470
Eh, they're up and down,

317
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,500
but the kids on the monkey bars are climbing.

318
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,450
That's all I got.

319
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,800
Like every election with one week to go,

320
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,310
this is in the bag.

321
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,380
Don't be so sure.

322
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,560
I'm up against a tough opponent:

323
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,100
Dubya Spuckler.

325
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,890
Look at this negative ad he did.

326
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,790
Lisa Simpson says "Writin'" ends with a "G"

327
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,140
and "'rithmetic" starts with a "A."

328
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,900
You know what I say?

329
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,480
Don't worry. You just keep smiling.

330
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,160
Well, I do have an orthodontist appointment tomorrow

331
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,100
for a tune-up.

332
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,640
In the bag, Madam President.

333
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,440
Bup, don't be so sure.

334
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,280
Hey, I drew a picture of your inauguration.

335
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,480
I don't think I've ever looked more radiant.

337
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,770
Okay, kid. Your bottom braces are on.

338
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,980
What happened to my smile?

339
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,690
No, no, no, this is terrible.

340
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,490
I look like I actually feel.

341
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,820
In six months, you'll have perfect teeth.

342
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,870
Six months? I have to smile now.

343
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,750
No, I can power through this.

344
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,540
Uh, Ralph lost his retainer in the trash.

345
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,150
What can we, uh, do here?

346
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,110
New ones a $500.

347
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,150
Uh, so just what is this secret mission, Chief?

349
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,140
Well, let's just say you're on retainer.

350
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:37,080
-Let's see. I'll take this. -Aw, stop that.

351
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,080
Aw, come on, Marge. This minibar is paid for.

352
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:43,070
Do you know the street value of this Toblerone?

353
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,390
Homer, stop it.

354
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:48,010
I can't help thinking about that poor woman.

355
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:51,360
Artie only married her because she looks like me.

356
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,970
I mean, a lot like me.

357
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,150
You're right. We have to find her and tell her.

358
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,520
But, first, there's something naughty

359
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,350
I want to do with this bed.

360
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,710
Are you sure we should be here?

361
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,600
This is technically his honeymoon.

362
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:16,840
Artie?

363
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,590
I'm at the lowest point of my life!

364
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,880
But come on in.

365
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,730
As a woman, I just want to tell your wife

366
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,640
what's really going on here.

367
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,350
Sure, why not?

368
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,480
Say it to her face!

369
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,980
Now you know my secret.

370
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,670
I've spent years trying to build the perfect copy

371
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,740
of the only woman for me: you, Marge.

372
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,630
But they were all inferior in somy.

373
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,930
This one lacks kindness.

374
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,660
This one keeps trying to kill me.

375
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,550
This one's head is a toaster!

376
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,390
And the slots aren't even big enough for a bagel!

377
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,530
Why would you marry a machine?

378
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,000
I didn't.

379
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,660
It was one last trick.

380
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,820
I thought when you saw how perfect we look together,

381
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,470
you would realize that we were meant to be.

382
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,960
I am, as the poet once said, a dumb schmuck.

383
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,600
- Artie. - Yes?

384
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,430
You're not dumb. You're smart.

385
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,250
And I think this crazy project

386
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,350
actually had some brilliance in it.

387
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:19,970
Imagine if you use that noodle for good.

388
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,290
Wow. Wow.

389
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:26,740
Only you could find a pearl in the flabby oyster that is me.

390
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,970
I will become a better human being.

391
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,170
Terrific.

392
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:32,290
And then you'll love me?

393
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,640
No.

394
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,940
Well, then, I finally give up.

395
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,480
Or do I?

396
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:42,090
Aw, damn it.

397
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:46,240
Artie, you and your blue crew of Margekateers

399
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,980
have done so many good deeds.

400
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,390
What's next?

401
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,290
I'm gonna make one of them my bride.

402
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,320
Hey, I didn't give you wings.

403
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,870
Life finds a way!

405
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,680
Uh, let's quiet down, please.

406
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,100
The sooner we can get this debate over,

407
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,050
the sooner the teachers can get ice cream.

409
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,020
None for Seymour. He gets gassy.

410
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,640
Yeah I-I know.

411
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,690
And now we have a very special moderator,

412
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,060
Governor Mary Bailey.

413
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:18,550
Our first candidate is Dubya Spuckler.

414
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,070
Dubya! Dubya!

415
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,320
That's your brother.

416
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,250
He prefers the pronoun "They,"

417
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,570
on account of the twin he absorbed in my belly.

418
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,500
Our other candidate is ill, so she'll be Skyping in.

419
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,820
Lisa Simpson.

420
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,430
Lisa, I'm sorry, what do you have?

421
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:37,280
What I have is an agenda for this school

422
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,390
an agenda that looks forward.

423
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:42,140
I can deliver results, while my opponent

424
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,570
can't even spell "Results."

425
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,710
Yes, I can. R-E squiggly letter,

426
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,270
buet letter, tall man,

427
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,240
little plus sign, squiggly letter.

428
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,200
"Results."

429
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:54,030
That's not how you spell "Results."

430
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,740
Lisa doesn't sound sick at all.

431
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,870
You said you've done this before.

432
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,200
It was my machismo talking.

433
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,830
Lisa's using a funny-face app.

434
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,240
Listen, I tried to fool you, and that was wrong.

435
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,380
This is an abomination!

436
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,330
What are you doing at a school debate?

437
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,320
My illegitimate son goes here.

438
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,910
Oh, the shame.

439
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,980
I still have good ideas.

440
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,610
All I hear is "Nag, nag, nag."

441
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:37,060
Dubya! Dubya!

442
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,710
Dubya! Dubya!

443
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,300
Oh, boy.

444
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,800
I didn't want to believe my popularity was

445
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,170
based on my stupid smile.

446
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,310
Oh, but it was.

447
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,520
You're just a kid, and things are changing.

448
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,540
In the future, women will be judged

449
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,790
by what they say, not how they look.

450
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:59,910
Maybe, but the future is a really long way away.

451
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,080
Told you you should smile more.

452
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,730
The future is now!

453
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:13,720
A toast. I have finally perfected you.

454
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,750
You all look just like Marge, and you will never leave.

455
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,870
Now, which of you lucky girls wants to party with Arty?

456
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:25,550
I am in power save mode.

457
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,960
Oh, fine. What about you two?

458
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,320
Power save.

459
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,720
One percent battery.

460
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,690
I just don't like you.

461
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,750
Oh! That counts as a kiss.
