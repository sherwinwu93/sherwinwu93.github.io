20
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:13,420
Hey there chief. Look at your mail box,

21
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:13,750
it hasn't been emptied for weeks.

22
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,380
Oh no... not the mail.

23
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,990
What if I'm missing out on coupon packs,

24
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,370
or perhaps a jury summons?

25
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:25,250
How will I live without my paper e-mails?

26
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,900
Eh, I get it.

27
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,600
But be a pal, pally. Empty it out.

28
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,710
Hmm, it has been baking in the sun for a while.

29
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,980
I think it's done.

30
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,210
Mail loaf!

31
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,140
Carve that mail. Carve it good.

32
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,210
Who wants an end piece?

33
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,920
I'm invited to a birthday party at Addy's.

34
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,250
Addy? I don't know that friend. What subject does she teach?

35
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,820
It's a kid!

36
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:11,530
I know kids. It's a sleepover at Addy's house.

37
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:15,090
Addy! Remember the library?

38
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,860
Library Marge.

39
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:22,530
We were the only ones who loves this old series of books Gallop Girls.

40
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,530
Mmm, old book smell.

41
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,440
Mmm, new friend smell.

42
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,670
What is the deal with girls and horses?

43
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,010
Is it 'cause boys took all the good animals,

44
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,820
like dogs and ninjas?

45
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,930
Horses are nature's triumph.

46
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,860
They have the perfect combination of power,

47
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,360
grace and braidable hair.

48
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,690
Dumb, dumb, stupid. Legs don't move.

49
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,420
Ew. Pink?!

50
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,580
Once cars were invented, why didn't they just

51
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,930
kill all the horses. With the cars?

52
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,540
Beat it Summer School.

53
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,850
Horse-a-copter attack! It' s plops or bomb

54
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,230
Let her go, She's a rescue and uneasy around men.

55
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,070
My paddock!

56
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,180
No horse play.

57
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,330
Horse play.

58
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,340
Marge, guess whaI said. Fight on.

59
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:32,970
Why? Why do you always wreck the stuff I care about?

60
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,640
Big brothers are supposed to be helpful and a little nice.

61
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,880
I wish I could un-brother you.

62
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,350
Not if I un-sister you first.

63
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,620
Fine. By the power of safety scissors,

64
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:48,010
I hereby sever the sibling bond.

65
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,260
Snip.

66
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,510
Look at that house.

67
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,070
I bet they use their garage for cars.

68
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,540
Horsey birthday!

69
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,890
Your house is huge.

70
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,830
Yeah, it's kind of embarrassing.

71
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,080
My dad's the exclusive ketchup distributor

72
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,120
for stadiums and megachurches.

73
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,240
She's obviously lying. Ketchup is free.

74
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,230
Play along.

75
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,610
Hi, I'm Marge.

76
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,740
Lisa's really been looking forward to your daughter's party.

77
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,760
Oh, no, I'm the party planner.

78
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,020
The mother's on a photoshopping retreat to get her son into USC.

79
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,910
Have fun. We'll see you tomorrow.

80
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,290
10:00 a.m. pickup. Goodbyes and gift bags.

81
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:42,230
They're so rich, they know the future.

82
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,300
Well, I just finished the Gallop Girls book

83
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,720
where George Washington's horse exposed Benedict Arnold's horse

84
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,130
as a traitor.

85
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,110
I kind of wanted it to be a surprise.

86
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,660
We kind of own horses.

87
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,860
You know, Lisa has a sleepover, Grampa's with the other ones,

88
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,120
and we are near the marina.

89
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,200
I'm not looking for your lost sunglasses.

90
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,650
It's been six years. They're gone.

91
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:22,580
You are always saying how I never make plans for us.

92
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,090
Well, how about a sunset cruise?

93
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:30,480
I only ever read about those in Sunset Cruise magazine.

94
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,520
There's even live music.

96
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,170
This is the band that was gonna play Lenny's wedding reception

97
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,460
if he didn't get pepper-sprayed at the altar.

98
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,470
I forgot how handsome you are

99
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,740
when you make the slightest effort.

100
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,200
Don't worry.

101
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,990
If you get thrown, your vest will automatically inflate

102
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,070
so it breaks your fall.

103
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,430
Now use the reins.

104
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,770
Sunflower wants you to lead her.

105
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,940
What's the matter, Addison? You didn't like my post.

106
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,350
Is your thumb broken?

107
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,640
Thumb broken?

108
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,660
Tessa Rose, you are brills. Completely brills.

109
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,490
Literally, that was the funniest thing ever.

110
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,810
I can't stop laughing.

111
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,740
Addison, why is she staring at us?

112
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,950
Addision? ‭

113
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,850
Is that what you like to be called?

114
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,710
This is my crew.

115
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,100
You probably know them all from social.

116
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,930
This is Bella-Ella. She's from old money. Myspace.

118
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,120
Sloan. British.

119
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,500
And, of course, beauty icon Tessa Rose.

120
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,100
Don't you just hate her?

121
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,620
Oh, right, uh, guys, this is Lisa.

122
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,100
- She's... her. - Nice to meet you, guys.

123
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,910
Um, you need to calm down.

124
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,370
I am calm.

125
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,290
- Stop yelling. - I'm not yelling.

126
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,180
Look, matchy-matchy,

127
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,260
I don't need drama from someone

128
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,000
whose shirt is a spoiler for her pants.

129
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,240
You're hilarious. I will never stop laughing.

130
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,190
Your friends seem, um, different than you.

131
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:17,590
That one keeps saying things are funny, but she's not laughing.

133
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:21,400
Oh, she can't. Her mom got too much Botox when she was pregnant.

134
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,770
Ugh, so lucky.

135
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,990
I know they seem cliquey and stuck-up and...

136
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,810
- Awful? - Yeah.

137
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,650
But once they accept you,

138
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,230
you'll see that, deep down,they're... nice.

139
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,990
Oh, good, good. So they're not mean.

140
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,420
Oh, I almost judged them.

141
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,930
That was close.

142
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,800
These will totally hide my kombucha hangovers.

143
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,280
I got them in the city.The city is New York.

144
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,830
New York City?

145
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:55,820
I'll make a note, in a book. A notebook.

146
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,060
A phone case.

147
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,520
It's for the new MyPhone.

148
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,020
There's no buttons, and the camera only faces you.

149
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,840
It's literally unusable.

150
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,420
What about my gift?

151
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,560
Look, it's got a little straw hat

152
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,610
that fits right over his ears.

153
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,960
She got her a toy.

154
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,640
Does it come with a nappy?

155
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,650
Oh, my God, I'm laughing so hard,

156
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,950
I can't even breathe.

157
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,850
Does it dispense bronzer? Bronzer remover? What does it dispense?

158
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,130
How is it makeup?

159
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,170
But you like it, don't you, Addy?

160
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,630
Oh, it's... adorable.

161
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,040
For a "widdle" baby.

164
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,590
You're breaking up, honey.

165
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,310
How's the party?

166
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,070
It's not fun. I don't want to stay.

167
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,850
I want to go home.

168
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,460
It's... fun.

169
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,630
I don't want to... go home.

170
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,970
Thanks for the uneventful update.

171
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,060
How's Lisa?

172
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,770
Having fun and not wanting to go home.

173
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,340
Sounds like fun.

176
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,290
You're right. Daddy understands completely.

177
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,770
That's what daddies do.

179
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:24,020
I'm trapped. All night.

180
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,160
With them.

181
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,800
What do you mean the Taylor Swift lookalike canceled?

182
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,380
Now who are the girls gonna throw cupcakes at?

183
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,900
Finally. You're the only adult here.

184
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,060
I want to go home. Can you help me?

185
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,710
Oh, no, this sleepover has got to get 100% engagement.

186
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,400
I can't go back to working at Bubba Gump Shrimp.

187
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,940
It's not shrimp.

188
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,730
Hey, lady bosses,

189
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,420
who wants to visit the perfume lab

190
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,840
and start your own fempire?

191
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:02,140
What are you wearing, Desperation by Thirsty Grandma?

192
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,620
I'm 26.

193
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,840
Let's binge the new season of Thank God I'm Dead.

194
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,980
T.G. I'm. D is literally massive.

195
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,160
Leandra's funeral is so on my vision board.

196
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,960
I'm not allowed to watch that show

197
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,520
'cause it glamorizes inappropriateness.

198
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,980
It'll be okay. Just close your eyes.

202
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,140
We get it, warnings, this show is awesome.

204
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:40,860
Now that she's gone, she's finally popular.

205
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,160
I'm gonna ask her ghost to the prom.

206
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,010
Someone's about to go viral.

207
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,270
Baby videos are super popular.

209
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,640
What are you doing in here? This is the caterers' bathroom.

210
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,400
This Japanese toilet is the first kind voice

211
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,790
I've heard all night.

213
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,910
Addy, why did you invite me to this party? Just to torture me?

214
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,190
Okay. Full disclosure, I invited you

215
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,830
because those other girls are always so mean to me.

216
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:56,630
But then they were mean to you instead and let me join in.

217
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,500
Oh, thanks for making this the best birthday ever.

218
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:04,210
Wait, no "Aw." That's horrible.

219
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,030
No, don't you see?

220
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,200
Next time, you bring a Lisa.

221
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,780
Someone from band camp or science club or whatever,

222
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:16,540
and then we'll all turn on her and you'll be part of the squad.

223
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,740
No, no. No, this can't be who you really are.

224
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,930
Let me whiten your teeth, Lisa. I've got strips.

225
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,600
Strips, Lisa! Lisa, come back! I've got whitening strips!

226
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,690
And it's the Old-Man-apolis 500,

227
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,180
but he spun out into Dead Man's Crack.

228
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,330
Grampa, it's Lisa.

229
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:41,490
- I need your help. - What's the matter, loser?

230
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,390
Did a horse bite your head off, and now you're crying

231
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,770
because you don't have a head?

232
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,520
Ha! Called it.

233
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,850
The girls at this party are so mean.

234
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:53,020
there's no one else to help me, and I just want to go home.

235
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,130
Oh, I would love to help, but you un-brothered me.

236
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:59,390
Now all I am is a stranger who magnetized your saxophone.

237
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,470
Please, somewhere inside you

238
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,740
there is an ember of connection between us.

239
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,270
This is me asking you to fan that ember.

240
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,470
Call me back and say it in a normal way.

241
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,610
Get me out of here!

242
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:23,070
Look, the rando's talking into a phone.

243
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:26,160
Phones are for looking at, rando.

244
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,330
Bart, they're taking my phone.

245
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,220
They're even meaner than you.

246
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,650
Are you Juan Starnotip?

247
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,460
Just drive.

248
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,650
So, Juan, going somewhere this evening?

249
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,230
The entered address.

250
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:52,160
I like you, Juan. You're clearly comfortable in your own skin.

251
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,310
Can I interest you in a room-temperature sparkling water?

252
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,770
I requested no conversation.

254
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,030
Give it back!

255
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,560
This phone is made by Subway.

256
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,750
My dad had to eat a thousand footlongs for that!

257
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,920
Quit hitting on my wife, you crooning sex pirate.

258
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,600
That chick behind that blue-haired lady's your wife?

259
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,540
Way to go, man.

260
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,570
Oh, right, uh,

261
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,280
I'll just get out of your way.

262
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,810
This is for not hitting on my wife.

263
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,430
- The set list. - Our banter is on there.

264
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,590
What songs do we know?

265
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,820
Without the booze, it's just a cruise!

266
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,220
Dude, you killed the music.

267
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:02,210
And the vibe. Time of death: 10:30 pm.

268
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,330
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

269
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,660
Now let's get out of here before they realize I'm going.

270
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,020
This sleepover isn't over.

271
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,920
No, yes, it is. When we leave, it's over.

272
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,050
Look, I didn't come here to rescue you.

273
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,910
If you run now, you'll never stop running.

274
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,830
What do you mean?

275
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:38,210
There's one present you still have to give those rich girls.

276
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,700
- Revenge. - Revenge?

278
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,870
Revenge.

279
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,720
Okay, right. Revenge. Right. I can do that.

280
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,960
‭- What do I do? - I can't tell you.

281
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,920
True revenge can only come from the hate in your own heart.

282
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,920
Hate.

283
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,920
If you do it tight enough, it's just like a face-lift.

284
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,770
Oh, my God. I could pass for six.

285
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,680
I know just what to do.

287
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,640
Hi, Mom.

288
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,150
I saw you called a bunch of times. Is everything okay?

289
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,160
Yeah, everything is great. I love you, good night.

290
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,530
At least she's having fun.

291
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,560
Your Mos Eisley fracas has utterly harshed

293
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,990
my Arrakeen spice buzz.

295
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,770
That's right, a two-reference complaint!

296
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,720
My wife and I have been looking forward to this for months,

297
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,230
- and you ruined our plans. - Yeah.

298
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:04,860
Plans? Yeah, we all love to make plans, don't we?

299
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:08,090
Dinner and a movie, couples' karaoke, game night

300
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,910
where the hosts are really just trying to sell Amway.

302
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,370
We're all so eager to get out of the house.

303
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,460
But why?

304
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,730
To stand in line to have your picture taken

305
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:21,360
holding a mustache on a stick?

306
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:27,650
And all these magical plans are supposed to lead up to romance.

307
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:30,120
But when you get home, you feel tired and gross

308
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,980
and a thousand years old.

309
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,640
So you make plans for another night and another,

310
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,430
and the cycle continues until the only time

311
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,920
you touch your wife is when you don't notice

312
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,520
she's on the toilet at 4:00 A.M. and you sit on her.

313
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,150
I didn't ruin this cruise.

314
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,370
I saved your life.

315
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:55,230
Now return to your homes and never make plans again.

316
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,010
That egghead rando messed with our hair.

317
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,350
We look like her!

318
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,590
Don't worry. I have a car waiting.

319
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,070
An airport pickup during surge pricing?

320
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:30,320
So long, dot matrix printer, hello, bubble jet.

321
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,370
This way.

322
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:42,970
You go ahead.

323
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,670
You don't hate horses.

324
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,350
You're afraid of them.

325
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:51,050
No, I'm not. I-I just hate any animal that works with cops.

326
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,100
No creature should be that jacked.

327
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,710
You didn't let me quit when I was scared,

328
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,080
so I'm gonna help you see

329
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,690
that this majestic creature has a gentle soul.

330
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:06,410
Not behind her! She'll kick your face off!

331
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,990
We're gonna destroy you on Insta, TikTok and Postmates.

332
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:38,660
You'll be a total outcast and you'll have to pick up your own sushi.

333
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,340
Ugh, no Wi-Fi?

334
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,960
Does your horse even have a mobile hot spot, Addison?

335
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,340
Addison, can I talk to Addy, my book buddy?

336
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,450
Hmm, I have to be Addison.

337
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:51,510
Addy's just a little girl.

338
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,610
Don't you remember when we were reading this?

339
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:57,160
We were just kids, sharing something we loved.

340
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,560
Addison, she's trying to influence you,

341
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,260
and she's not even monetizing it.

342
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,540
I'm so going to swat her house on Christmas morning.

343
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:06,930
Don't let that rando upset you.

344
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,330
Have a Klonopin gummy.

345
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,160
Be the girl I know you are.

346
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,360
Old book smell.

347
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,040
Stop holding a book, Addison. You're acting like a rando.

348
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:25,640
My name is Addy.

349
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,470
Oh, my...

350
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,020
Go!

351
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:36,060
Come with us. There's nothing left for you here.

352
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,470
It's my house. All my stuff is in it.

353
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,540
Oh, right, right. Well, all right.

354
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,570
Maybe I'll see you at the library.

355
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:44,680
Lisa?

356
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,940
You were my best gift.

357
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:52,020
Addison, are you out of your mind?

358
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,860
Netflix should make a series about your social life,

359
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,350
because it just committed suicide.

360
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,090
She is so mean.

361
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,570
I want to be her friend.

362
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:03,670
Literally.
