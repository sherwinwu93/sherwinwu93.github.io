22
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,130
None of you will inherit anything.

23
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,920
Because there isn't any.

25
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,070
Previously on The Simpsons,

26
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,040
a charismatic new preacher came to Springfield.

27
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,030
You want to hold my gun? Y-You can.

28
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,750
And Lisa admired him like no adult man she'd ever met.

29
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:42,410
This brunch has turned into... a jazz brunch!

30
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,010
Reverend Lovejoy lost his job

31
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,660
and swore revenge.

32
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,830
This is...

35
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,330
This preacher is so amazing.

36
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,870
I'm looking forward to this.

37
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,330
This is the first time I've come to church

38
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,380
when it's not part of a big montage

39
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,660
of my enemies being whacked.

40
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,470
Well, someone looks awfully nice for church.

41
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,580
Oh, this thing?

42
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,760
Are you sure you aren't just attracted

43
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,680
to our handsome new pastor?

44
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,500
Silly. Moms aren't attracted to pastors.

45
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,900
Oh, this place is so crowded.

46
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,930
My leg is touching Milhouse's dad's.

47
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,720
Looks like we're knee neighbors, huh, buddy?

48
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,660
Mr. Smithers.

49
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,370
I don't think I've ever seen you without Mr. Burns.

50
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,290
Oh, Mr. Burns is more comfortable at home

51
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,190
reading his copies of the scriptures.

52
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,240
"Blessed be the poor"?

53
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,950
I'm just finding this out now?

54
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,490
No one must know.

55
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,830
Exellus.

56
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:12,870
Good morning.

57
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,750
Good morning.

58
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,100
For those of you interested in the Packers game...

59
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,770
We don't want to know.

60
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,480
So, I know some of you still have some questions about me.

61
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,900
I certainly do.

62
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,600
Will you be godfather to my son?

63
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,230
We're not there yet, Mel.

64
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,570
But, seriously, fewer and fewer people are coming to church.

65
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:31,990
Numbers are declining.

66
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,160
And I get it.

67
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,330
When you tell people that you believe in God,

68
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,580
usually they take that to mean

69
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,830
that you're quietly judging their lifestyle

70
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,650
or think everybody but you is going to Hell.

71
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,450
Way to preach, bitch.

72
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,990
I'm gonna pretend I heard "amen."

73
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,530
Oh, relax, bitch.

74
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,260
The original function of religion

75
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,390
was to bring us together. "Religion."

76
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,140
"Ligio," like "ligament."

77
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,890
It means to reconnect.

78
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,600
They don't teach you that at medical school.

79
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,680
Yes, they do.

80
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,150
Well, I learn from my mistakes.

81
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,010
Malpractice makes malperfect.

82
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,940
Well, I want to bring us all together.

83
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,650
Not just Christians but Hindus and Buddhists.

84
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,230
Even those that don't believe.

85
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,070
Does anyone besides me

86
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,190
miss church the way it was?

87
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,940
Well, the crickets agree.

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,630
This church has gone from a place

90
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,880
of warm, awkward silence into a gooey lovefest

91
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,380
run by a narcissistic kum-bah-yo-yo,

92
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,220
and I will not stand for it.

93
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,090
You and I believe in the same God.

94
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,600
I just believe that that God loves everyone.

95
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,100
You don't agree with that, Ned?

96
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,430
Sir, we are not on a first-name basis.

97
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,560
Mr. Flanders.

98
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,400
You may call me New Evangelical Deacon,

99
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,550
or Ned for short.

100
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,900
Okay, Ned, look,

101
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,570
God is the love, the "yes" that set the universe in motion.

102
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,180
He or She...

103
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,020
Maybe this time.

104
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,060
*Maybe this time*

105
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,030
*I will believe it*

107
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:06,610
*Maybe this time, I will pray*

108
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,950
*Maybe this time*

109
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,250
*For the first time*

110
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:20,250
*I'll have fun on Sunday*

111
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:33,890
*He will sermonize with those hazel eyes*

112
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,480
*‭I've got Buddha*

113
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,440
*I've got science*

114
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:44,030
*And now Jesus makes three*

115
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,780
*It's gonna happen*

117
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,450
*Happen sometime*

119
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,330
*Maybe this time*

121
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,160
*I'll pray*

122
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,680
Not bad, kid. Also not good.

123
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,920
Let me show you how it's done.

124
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,880
And a one, and a two.

125
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,280
Sleeping in church.

126
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,440
Like father like daughter.

127
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,650
God is nothing but grace and flow and forgiveness.

128
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:17,820
And if you don't think so,

129
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,360
I-I don't know, maybe you should go back

130
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,200
and read the Bible a little bit closer.

131
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,280
Are you questioning a man

132
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,570
who travels with extra Bibles to put them in hotel rooms?

133
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,490
Do you mind?

134
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,130
I'm sure you're very sincere,

135
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:34,620
but a parrot can recite the Bible and have no idea what it means.

136
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,960
What? What? What?

137
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,510
This isn't church anymore.

138
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,620
We're out of here.

139
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,970
Daddy, we can't leave before the pastor says so.

140
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,100
Who told you that?

141
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,100
You did.

142
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,470
You call it "Homer Simpson-ing."

143
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,220
Yeah, don't Homer Simpson, you jerk.

147
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,560
This is where he got fired.

148
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,990
Now we're gonna poke into

149
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,540
Mr. Perfect Pastor's pysterious past.

150
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,540
Did you just say "pysterious"?

151
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,660
Can't you be on my side for once?

152
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,470
Excuse me, we're looking for the pastor.

153
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,810
Oh, we don't have pastors.

154
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:30,420
But our touch screen directory does have a digital assistant.

155
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:34,440
Hi, I'm Holy Cow. How can I help you?

156
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,510
Please give us your fingerprint by pressing this screen.

158
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:44,190
You haven't pressed anything. Why not?

160
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:50,620
I'd like to speak to someone below God and above you.

161
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,780
Well, maybe you can find what you need in here.

165
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,910
How many of you suffer from the effects of mesothelioma?

166
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,910
Dial Jesus at ocho, ocho, ocho,

167
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,180
ocho, ocho, ocho, ocho.

169
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:16,770
Please help us.

170
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,940
This man is a fellow clergyman.

171
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,930
Really?

172
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,600
Church. Steeple. Doors. People.

173
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,520
Come with me.

174
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:30,070
Preacher Mac, I have a couple here to see you.

175
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,920
I'm here to discuss a matter of some unpleasantness.

176
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,880
You're not here from The Boston Globe, are you?

178
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,090
No, no, no, no, no. I'm a pastor, too.

179
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,010
I'm here there's a little dirt on the collar

180
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,840
of a man who use to preach here

181
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,620
Bode Wright.

183
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,100
Him? You better sit down.

184
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,170
It's a short story, but I'm gonna milk it.

185
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,170
I would go on,

186
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:58,650
but I'm down to my last vocal cord.

187
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,480
even for a pastor

188
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:04,950
I've taken way too long to make a simple point.

189
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,690
Now, here's the proof.

191
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,790
Oh, my God, so many singles in my area

193
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,860
want to meet me.

194
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,460
Possessions don't matter,

195
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,870
money doesn't matter, this doesn't matter.

196
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,540
Is he burning what I think he's burning?

197
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,620
I've got him now.

199
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,770
Lisa Marie Simpson

200
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,470
Are you reading the Bible?

201
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,820
Yes, it's good, but...

202
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,320
I have a few notes.

204
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,070
Yeah, well I never met a Hittite

205
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,100
who wasn't trying to expand his empire into Egypt.

206
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,740
Oh, Hittites... worse than the Canaanites!

207
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,950
Now who's doing it because of the handsome new pastor?

208
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,330
Reverend Wright?

209
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,110
You think he's...

210
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,870
Oh, why pretend?

211
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,590
When he speaks, I feel like he's speaking only to me.

212
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:04,300
Oh, Lisa, honey, I'm worried you'll get too attached.

213
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,960
This town has a way of rejecting what's new and different.

214
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,040
And better.

215
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,250
Not this time.

216
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,850
But look at your vision board.

217
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,800
It's full of nothing but crushing disappointment.

219
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,570
Even your vision board is a failure.

220
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,980
That hook was supposed to hold

221
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,810
a lifetime's worth of disappointment.

222
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,440
Get thee behind me, Saturn.

224
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,570
I need to pee.

225
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,740
No time. We've got defrocking to do.

226
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,460
Timothy, I've never seen you like this.

227
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,790
Maybe I'll do some defrocking, too.

228
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,800
In the choo choo room?

229
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,540
Okay, mood's gone.

230
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,640
Two beers, Moe.

231
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,930
Nothing for the reverend.

232
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,250
Oh, howdy there, Rev.

233
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,420
Well, can't let him see my nudie glasses.

234
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,730
You didn't have to break your nudie glasses.

235
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,400
Now you tell me. Uh, remind me--

236
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,220
how many boobs does a woman have?

237
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,320
I never got so much off my chest.

238
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,160
So, then I coveted my neighbor's riding mower.

239
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,870
I never pedal when I'm on a bicycle built for two.

240
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:19,570
- Homer... - I went trick-or-treating when I was 30.

241
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,670
Also, I told Marge I was going for a colonoscopy

242
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:27,580
when I actually went to a "Planet of the Apes" marathon.

243
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,550
Including the Tim Burton one.

244
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,090
- God doesn't care. - Hallelujah!

245
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,790
Please. I make my living in here.

246
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,970
Sorry. So am I forgiven?

247
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,680
You're a good man, Homer Simpson.

248
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,060
Behind all your behavior, good and bad,

249
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,230
there's a still, quiet place

250
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,900
untouched by the dramas of this life

251
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,190
where you simply "are" goodness.

252
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:49,070
Oh, you haven't heard the worst one.

253
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,030
I had impure thoughts

254
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:54,600
about the mother bear in the toilet paper ads.

255
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,700
Reverend? If that is your real honorific.

256
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,540
You are late for our parishioners' visit.

257
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,570
I've been preparing all day.

258
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,360
Uh, sorry. I've got to go.

259
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,580
Homer, does this Flanders guy ever annoy you?

260
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,260
From time to time.

261
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,880
Move it, move it, move it.

262
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,970
All right.

263
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,080
Which arm did the honking?

264
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:31,350
I'm not telling.

265
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,560
Come in.

266
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:52,660
You,sir, have challenged me on scripture.

267
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,220
Oh. Well, if it's scripture you want to talk,

268
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,250
then let us make a joyful noise unto the Lord.

269
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,420
-Good. -Good.

270
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,430
Punishment is the key to belief.

271
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,930
Matthew 25:46.

272
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,020
"They will go away to eternal punishment, but the..."

273
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,350
...righteous to eternal life." Sure.

274
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,810
But God's grace is for everyone.

275
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,270
John 12:32.

276
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,100
"I will draw all people..."

277
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,650
"...up to myself." Hmm.

278
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,780
What about 2 Thessalonians 1:9?

279
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,470
"They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction..."

280
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,070
Romans 11:32.

281
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,530
"He may have mercy on them all."

282
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,160
Them all.

284
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,050
Genesis 3:23.

285
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,670
"So the Lord banished him from the Garden."

286
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,790
Genesis 1:31.

287
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,630
"God saw all that He had made,

288
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,960
and it was very good."

289
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,840
I'm cold, so cold.

290
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,690
And I'm wearing three sweaters.

292
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,980
Wow. This is what it would be like

293
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,150
if they believed in God in Hawaii.

294
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,690
Reverend, you come to dinner at my house!

295
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:11,190
Uh, yeah, I'm gonna take a rain check.

296
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,320
So many checks, so little rain.

297
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,370
Stop this revelry!

298
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,130
Who are you?!

299
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,090
Reverend Lovejoy!

300
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:25,500
And I'm just back from Michigan.

301
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,260
Can you point accusingly for me?

302
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,260
You got it.

303
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,510
This man is a heretic.

304
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,260
Oh, no. No, Lisa, don't.

305
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,640
Wait, wait, wait!

306
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,910
Surely, we know the reverend is a blessed man who...

307
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,520
Lisa, I did something bad.

308
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,520
How bad could it be? Seriously.

309
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,320
Well, look at you,

310
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,990
finally paying attention to me.

311
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,420
One brief announcement: there's a red Honda Civic

312
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,670
- in the parking lot with its lights on. - You're losing them.

313
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,160
He burned the Bible.

314
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,720
Oh, boy.

315
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,270
That's appalling. I mean, come on.

316
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,890
Psalms are not for burning. They're for tattoos.

317
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,520
So, you know, you sicken me.

318
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,400
Everything in my heart tells me this isn't true!

319
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,770
I know this is a weird thing to say in church,

320
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,190
but we need proof.

321
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,600
I demand a full hearing in front of all of us!

322
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,290
Oh, you'll get your hearing.

323
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,850
Tuesday at 4:00.

324
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:27,150
Another paradise lost.

325
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,500
Lisa, you're really bringing down the first Sunday of Lent.

327
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,570
Even the fire eater is sad.

328
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,840
The crisis of faith grows

330
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,930
as support for im-preach-ment is now at 52%.

331
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:45,330
Can you fight fire with firing?

332
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,130
What should we do with this Judas priest?

333
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,770
This has been Kent Brockman talking,

334
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,090
saying nothing.

337
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,200
Welcome, all of you. Let's begin.

338
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,610
Why is she running this?

339
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,660
Because she won't get overexcited.

340
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,040
And I will?!

341
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,660
And the Bible said, "A child shall lead them."

343
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,000
Well, as my Lord Buddha said,

344
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,500
"Three things cannot long be hidden.

345
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,660
The sun, the moon, and the truth."

346
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,170
Well, why don't they make that a Google Doodle?

347
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,300
Reverend, you're very concerned with the Bible.

348
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,550
So, let us turn to that Bible.

349
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,370
Specifically, the very, very, many parts

350
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,590
that speak about forgiveness.

352
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,150
And, Mom, thank you for sewing these banners.

353
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,070
I did all that work for a ten-second bit?

354
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,870
He did it. He admitted it.

355
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,700
What else do you need?

356
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,950
We've mobbed for less, people.

357
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,650
Yeah, remember the guy with the two different-colored socks?

358
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,570
Ran his ass right out of town.

359
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,570
Banish him!

360
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,090
Banish him! Banish him!

361
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:02,010
Cherish him! Cherish him!

362
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:04,470
I know another long-haired performer

363
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:07,560
who preached a new philosophy, peace and love.

364
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,010
And the crowd was with him,

365
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,320
but then they turned, hard.

366
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,760
And that man's name was Willie Nelson!

368
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:18,260
Well, I say, banish him! Banish him!

369
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,560
Banish him! Banish him!

370
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:22,430
Stop!

371
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:26,280
I came here to unify you, but instead I divided you.

372
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,370
So I'm leaving.

373
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:30,060
I just hope what I said resonated with a few of you.

374
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,610
Like Lisa, one who may change the world.

375
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,620
And that Sea Captain guy. That dude is surprisingly woke.

376
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:41,410
Ya, activism means nothing if it's not intersectional. Yarr!

378
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,830
Glad to have known you.

379
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,040
I just want to say, you've changed my life forever.

380
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,220
You're the first minister I've ever met

381
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,290
I didn't want to slap across the face.

382
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,550
Glad to have known you.

383
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,090
And I just want to say, rot in Hell, Bible burner.

384
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,300
Glad to have known you.

385
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,270
- Glad to have... - Bup-bup-bup.

386
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,860
In my family, you don't say goodbye to someone

387
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,350
you care about without a meat loaf.

388
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,850
And broccoli.

389
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,070
You-You're inviting me over for dinner?

390
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,450
If you can love us after seeing us eat,

391
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,040
we'll know you really love us.

392
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,320
Come on, pal. We're having roast Bible.

393
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,400
What? Too soon?

394
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,910
I just want to offer this simple prayer:

395
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,840
Dear God, please let the Simpsons never end.

396
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,630
Amen.

397
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:30,390
And, Bode, tomorrow I have to ask you a philosophical question,

398
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,170
so I'll see you at the church.

399
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,860
- Amen. - Where the hell have you been?

402
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,480
Why would you burn a Bible?

403
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,770
Why couldn't you burn Bill O'Reilly's books?

405
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,780
There are so many.

406
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,030
I was trying to tell people that God is in your heart,

407
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:49,070
not in a overbuilt cathedral or some book.

408
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,280
This town doesn't get subtext.

409
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,400
Our NPR station broadcasts wrestling.

410
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,080
And that's an excruciating half nelson.

411
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,670
Now, is that what's known in the lexicon as a "face stomp"?

412
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,790
Yes, yes, its.

413
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,580
This is NPR pledge week. Please give.

414
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,630
- Why did you do it? - I was 19.

415
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:12,640
I saw how people were using the Bible to divide and exclude.

416
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,930
People were so busy worshipping a road map

417
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,710
instead of trying to reach the destination.

418
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:18,840
You know what I mean?

419
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,900
Well, why didn't you just say that?

420
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,360
That was fine. No fire.

421
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,850
- I was 19. - I'm eight and I get it.

422
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:31,530
You're right. I've regretted it since the day I did it.

423
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:34,120
So, since then, I've just wandered the world,

424
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,200
like a millennial on a gap year.

425
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,110
I understand, but how are you gonna convince...?

427
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,530
I'll just have faith in this town's open heart.

428
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,300
I was just making sure it doesn't say "We forgive you."

429
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,800
- It doesn't. - Unless they wrote it in red.

430
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,760
Yeah, no.

431
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,260
- No, they didn't. - No.

432
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,630
- The brick is the message. - Them's my people.

433
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,470
- Yeah. - Yeah.

434
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,340
Do we throw it back? What's your custom?

435
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:07,150
Uh, Chief, this guy still had ten minutes on his meter.

436
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,900
Just when I understood that guy, when I believed again,

437
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,730
when I believed in people, they took him away.

438
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,120
I've lost my faith, Lou.

439
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,520
Come on, Chief, you got a beautiful wife and kid-- I can't...

440
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,620
I'm sorry, I can't say that with a straight face.

441
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,110
Well, you could try.

442
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,960
I am. I-I'm trying, I'm sorry.

443
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,340
I'm sorry. I'll maybe try again.

444
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,910
You got a beautiful wife and kid.
