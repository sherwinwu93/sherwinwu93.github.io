26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,450
Maybe we should find a new playground.

29
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,720
Oh. This looks nice.

30
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,950
Shady trees, bathrooms with doors

31
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,720
and that loopy-loop slide

32
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,430
dumps you out on soft recycled tires.

33
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,580
Oh, Pirellis.

34
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,810
Oh, look! It's your friend Hudson.

35
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,180
My son seems to really like your daughter.

36
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,120
- Courtney. - Marge.

37
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,530
- Is that ironic or retro? - It's my name.

38
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,940
They're having so much fun.

39
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,530
- Is she free for a playdate tomorrow? - Yes.

40
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,940
Has she been in the same room as a peanut recently?

41
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:49,660
No.

42
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,340
Can I check off her vaccinations?

43
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,090
TB? DTaP? Measles-mumps-rubella?

44
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,900
Yes, yes, yes.

45
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,030
Breast or bottle?

46
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,290
Bottle, but I'm not a monster. I can bring cookies.

47
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,920
White sugar. That's hilarious.

48
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,820
I'll have to tell my partner you said that.

49
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,430
Well, I'm gonna tell my partner you mocked white sugar.

50
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,910
See you tomorrow.

51
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,480
Pancakes are on the table, Homie.

52
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,990
And flapjacks will be ready in a few minutes.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,040
Marge, I'm trying to lose weight.

54
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,850
Pancakes will be fine.

55
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,070
Are you sure?

56
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:33,720
I have to face facts. In some small ways, I've let myself go.

57
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,130
What's wrong? Who died?

58
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,760
We're worried you will.

59
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,160
We want you to live longer, Dad.

60
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,710
Never what I want.

61
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,820
Fine.

62
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,710
You know what, skip the pancakes.

63
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,170
I'll just have...

64
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,280
a grapefruit to go.

65
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,500
I didn't see the moon landing or the fall of the Berlin Wall,

66
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,250
I did see my father take a grapefruit to go.

67
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,610
Thanks a lot, pal! You cost us the pennant!

68
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,120
Yeah, right there!

69
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,150
Yesterday's pizza.

70
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,510
I have been dreaming about you my friend.

71
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,530
While I slept, I said, "Extra large."

72
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:24,160
But I told my wife I said, "Sexy Marge."

74
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:39,340
Why didn't put on my pizza-eating gloves.

77
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,590
Where are you, Homer?

78
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,390
Burns just called a staff meeting.

79
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,890
The only seats are next to him.

80
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,000
Oh, God, I need a miracle.

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,110
Hey, why don't you bring a balloon to your coworkers?

83
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,110
They're like kites without the hard work.

84
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,750
How long have you been selling balloons.

85
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,820
It's an interesting story.

86
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,750
*Well, this is a story of a poor mountain man*

87
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,260
*Spoke worse English than Mr. Jackie Chan*

88
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,620
*Then one day, he was tendin' to his still*

89
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,720
*Heard a hissing sound and his pants began to fill*

90
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,740
Helium. See-through gold. Symbol, H-E.

91
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,050
*Well, the first thing you know...*

92
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,320
He's gone. My best friend is gone.

94
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:42,950
I want you to know that the coworker you thought was Chip Incognito

95
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,100
was actually me undercover. .

96
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,540
Sorry I am late everybody.

97
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,700
Here, have a balloon.

98
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:51,040
Simpson, Mr. Burns is a Fortune 500 CEO.

99
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,910
He's not going to...

100
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,180
Quiet, you fool.

101
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,100
Pure, uncut helium.

102
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,560
Thanks to birthday balloons, rarer than ever.

103
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,980
Smithers, might I remind you we pay a fortune

104
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,870
for helium to cool our reactors?

105
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,940
Right as always, sir.

106
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:05,970
Right as always, sir.

107
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,900
That price is sky-high!

108
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,380
Where did you get this?

109
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,880
Oh, the bumpkin I got it from has tons of it.

110
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,140
But I got to warn you...

111
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,640
he has no idea of what it's worth.

112
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,910
Excellent.

113
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,360
How I love a good swindle.

114
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,570
What do you think?

115
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,690
He called on me!

116
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,650
As for you, Simpson, Employee of the Month.

118
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,570
So, Marge, I killed it at the staff meeting today.

119
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,470
The key is preparation.

120
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,030
Something amazing has happened to Maggie.

121
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,980
She's in love.

122
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,610
If this gets any cuter, I'm gonna bust.

123
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,180
Cletus, get the dang door!

124
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,830
I can't very well answer the door with an unloaded shotgun,

125
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,920
Can I, woman?

126
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,820
Howdy, neighbor.

127
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,830
May I offer you some Manhattan squirrel chowder?

128
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,180
You smell like indoor plumbin'.

129
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,480
He's onto us.

130
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,440
No need to pretend we're inbred hicks.

131
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:22,690
No offense, goober.

132
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:23,910
None taken.

133
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,780
All right, Spuckler. You've got helium, which I want.

134
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,710
I've got what you want,

135
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,760
a tin cup filled with dimes.

136
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,210
Let's make a deal.

137
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,720
Now, hold on.

138
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,960
I likes to have a drink with a feller

139
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,850
beforen I make a busy-ness deal.

140
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,860
I have imbibed every intoxicant

142
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,380
from sweet Yale beer to Flint, Michigan water.

143
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,800
Do your worst.

144
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,870
lutely no effect upon my...

145
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,920
Sir, maybe this Spuckler fellow

146
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,770
is a little smarter than we thought.

147
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,880
Nonsense.

148
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,560
Perhaps it takes an idiot to catch an idiot.

149
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:26,270
Hello! Could I get a little help? I dropped my sandwich in here.

150
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,290
You and Mr. Spuckler will enter into what the hoi polloi called a

151
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:33,500
"Friendship,"

152
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,610
then use that friendship to destroy his life

153
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,190
from the inside out.

154
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,250
I don't know. He's got kids.

155
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,810
I can't cheat a family out of their home.

156
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,850
But you're perfectly fine

157
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,630
cheating me out of their home.

158
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,020
Oh. You're trying to confuse me.

159
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,190
I got to get out. Where's the trap door?

160
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,340
Save me.

161
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,650
You know Weinstein from Accounting.

162
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,990
If you're confused,

163
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:01,570
perhaps these two gentlemen can clarify things.

164
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,930
This fellow loves inflicting pain.

165
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,340
And this fellow loves to laugh while he watches

166
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,830
this one produce the pain.

167
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,310
Are you the pain guy or the laugh guy?

168
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,060
Answer the question.

169
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,140
Hello? Maggie Simpson here for a playdate.

170
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,800
Hudson's on a conference call.

171
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:26,800
I'll buzz you in.

172
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,050
You have a lovely home.

173
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,870
What is this floor made out of?

174
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,880
The tile was a Venetian church

175
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,540
which we dismantled, shipped over by small boat

176
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,270
and had lovingly installed by a 99-year-old I.M. Pei.

177
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,640
That sounds pricey.

178
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,840
No, the toilet is pricey.

179
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,880
The plumbers we hired to replace it are very inefficient.

180
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,420
Let's go, you little runts.

181
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,200
What? Are your diapers full?

182
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,550
Would you like some coffee as you fill out a sexual history?

183
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,260
Sexual history?

184
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,290
So our babies can be friends?

185
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,310
Here's mine.

186
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,150
All right.

187
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,270
Cream, no sugar.

189
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,950
So unusual to see a baby with a pacifier these days.

191
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,840
Your baby has such interesting hair.

192
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,760
You don't mind that I babyproofed your baby

193
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,430
- from my baby, do you? - Yes, I do.

194
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,830
Very much.

195
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,070
Maggie, let's go. Now.

196
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,740
And we're not coming back.

198
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,230
Whatcha doing there, friend?

199
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,400
Good to see you again.

202
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,480
- A-yup. - A-yup.

203
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,270
Nothing like a good "a-yup"

204
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,680
- to put a man at ease. - A-yup.

205
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,610
- A-yup. - A-yup.

206
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,780
- A-yup. - A-nope.

207
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,320
I mean, a-yup.

208
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,400
Say, friend,

209
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,520
looks like you're working awful hard

210
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,020
to suck the helium into them thar Mylar balloons.

211
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,880
Oh, it's powerful tiresome.

212
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,050
But the Lord done put helium under my feet,

213
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,360
and I must not spill it into the sky.

214
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,590
Now, listen.

215
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,600
Explain that you have a way to make his life easier.

216
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,020
Pretend it's your idea.

217
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,930
He's stupid enough to believe you have an idea.

218
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,690
Say, "What if I told you

219
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,010
there was a way to harvest that noble gas?"

220
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,680
"What if I told you there was a way

221
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,030
to harvest that noble gas

222
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,680
without the strain on your mouth puffer."

223
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,280
I'd say, "Aw, pshaw,"

224
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,990
but then I'd follow it with a "Go on."

225
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,400
Excellent.

226
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,160
"Excellent."

227
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,950
No, don't say excellent.

228
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,830
"No, don't say excellent."

229
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,000
No, don't say that, either.

230
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,330
"No, don't say that, either."

231
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,000
Just shut up.

232
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,390
"Just shut up."

233
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,030
I'll have to mull your proposal,

234
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,010
especially that last crazy part.

235
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,970
You just saved me a passel of work.

236
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,970
Now I can spend more time making more family.

237
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,570
Homer J. Simpson.

238
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,020
Cletus Delroy Montfort Bigglesworth Spuckler.

239
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,830
Now, let's go yonder

240
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,240
and get ourselves a mess of catfish.

241
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,190
All right, I'm gonna get my arm so deep into that catfish hole,

242
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:33,120
that ole chucklehead just bites my bone.

243
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,920
Easy-peasy.

244
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,210
Now, don't scare him. It sours up the flavor.

245
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,800
It's licking my eye.

246
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,010
Is it dead?

247
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,410
Thank you.

248
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,060
All right, nothing like a good ole Spuckler family fish fry.

249
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,070
Dear Lord, thank you for bringing

250
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,410
this hairless swamp beast our way.

251
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,960
His wisdom regarding your mystery balloon gas

252
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,230
has helped us Spucklers become a two-radio family.

253
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,580
Homer, I want to be your partner.

254
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,060
Seal the deal with a hillbilly handshake. Come on.

255
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,700
I consider you family now,

256
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,510
which is not really that select a circle.

258
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,700
- Excellent. - Where'd that come from?

259
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,750
Well done, Simpson. We'll take him for everything

260
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,600
except the couch on his lawn.

261
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,300
Well, but we're family.

262
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,400
Couldn't you just screw him half over?

263
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,290
No one screws anyone half over.

264
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,110
It's like having half a billion dollars. What's the point of that?

265
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,070
What's up?

266
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,640
I think we're both upset, but I'm worried you're gonna talk first.

267
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,270
No, you go ahead.

268
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:12,370
I'm supposed to screw over a guy that's only been nice to me.

269
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:14,310
I'm denying Maggie happiness

270
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,890
because I can't stand the mother of her friend.

271
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,070
Maggie'll be fine.

272
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,450
I just played with her.

273
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,190
She still thinks I've got her nose.

274
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,480
Wait, where'd I put it?

275
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,100
Not here.

276
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,750
No. No.

277
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,630
Look what you found.

279
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,110
I have something I need to tell you.

280
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,730
Hudson had a birthday party,

281
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,680
but I didn't tell you, so you missed it.

282
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,130
I can explain.

283
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,610
That other mom was just so annoying

284
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,450
with her aerial silks and those yoga pants.

285
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,630
She does Pilates, not yoga.

286
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,870
She made me feel bad about myself.

287
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,600
You get it, right? Right?

288
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,860
Get this contract signed, Simpson.

289
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,160
Or what?

290
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,750
Perhaps you need a little taste of what's in store.

291
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,670
Sorry, Smithers.

292
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:20,190
We didn't want to leave a mark that Cletus could see.

293
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,050
But you could've warned me first.

294
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,670
Fair enough. Watch your back.

295
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,040
Well, if it ain't my bestest friend

296
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,060
on God's flat Earth.

297
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,180
So, what's in your hand?

298
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,060
Some sort of a friendship certificate?

299
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,670
Uh, you know, just something

300
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:42,280
to put our partnership on the up-and-up.

301
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,870
Hey, what's more up-and-up than the helium business?

302
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,840
Ain't you gonna read it?

303
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,650
I trust you, like a sheep trusts a friendly wolf.

304
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,140
I signs with an "X"

305
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,680
'cause that's the kind of iPhone I got.

306
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,190
And now for the second slash that makes it official.

307
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,880
Oh, I need a straightedge.

308
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,410
Straight-Edge! Get over here, boy!

309
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,860
Yes, Daddy.

310
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,750
I can't do it.

311
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,870
You done floated my mark-maker.

312
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,140
I won't let you sign it.

313
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,180
It's all a trick to steal your helium.

314
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:28,410
You was gonna steal from a man what has 29 kids?

315
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,350
30, 31!

316
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,810
Yeah, but I told you before it was too late.

317
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,650
Okay, we're still buddies.

318
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,830
Getting mad at city folk for lying is like

319
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,880
getting mad ‭Okaat your six-year-oldes.

320
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,590
for not cleaning her gun.

321
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:47,090
-Put her there. -Uh, that's your left hand.

322
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,670
They's both left hands.

323
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,000
Simpson, you fool.

324
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,010
I hope you kissed your wife well this morning,

325
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,820
because it will be the last one.

326
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,290
Well, it was a medium.

327
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,740
Part of it hit her ear.

328
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,940
Hey, you harm my friend,

329
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,270
you ain't getting balloon one of my helium.

330
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,590
And I mean ever.

331
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:05,690
Quite the dilemma.

332
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,940
Smithers, solve this if you don't want another kick.

333
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,500
Cletus, about your helium.

334
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,740
What if we paid you a fair price?

335
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,460
County fair or state fair?

336
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,510
I can't lose to someone so stupid.

337
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,800
Goons, get him.

338
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,500
We'll pay you what's right.

339
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,640
We have a deal.

340
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,320
Have your people call my basset hound.

341
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:34,750
Well, this'll help you forget your billionaire troubles.

342
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,050
Have a toke on this, friend.

343
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,960
Help me! Help me!

344
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,180
You'll rue the day.

345
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,200
Smithers, power lines!

346
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:52,980
Oh, Maggie. You're too young to be miserable the rest of your life.

347
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,580
In this rom-com, I am not going to be the mean mother.

348
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,890
Let's go.

350
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,010
You know, the one thing we have in common

351
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:21,880
is we're willing to pretend that we like each other for our children.

352
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,160
To that, I say, "Kiss-kiss."

353
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,850
*Ooh, we're sharing some grits*

354
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:00,660
*Yours has butter, mine has possum gravy*

355
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,600
*We're pals, so I eat your weird food*

356
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:09,010
*Ooh, you're making me fat now, Homer*

357
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:11,870
*I don't have long to live*

359
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:16,580
*Ooh, you're the best friend*

360
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,690
*That I ever had, you're the one*

361
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,460
*Who keeps my balloons flying*

362
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,490
*You're my moonshine*

363
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,480
*And I want you to know*

364
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,060
*That I'm not sniffing glue*

366
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,940
*I really love you*

368
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,060
*Oh, you're my best friend*

369
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,980
*Ooh, you gave me your tooth*

370
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,310
*I love that you're whittlin' a stool for me*

371
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:50,010
*I need two, one for each cheek*

372
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:54,760
*Two, you'll have 'em next week, now, Homer*

373
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,170
*Cool, let's pee in the creek*

374
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:02,170
*Ooh, you're a mountain man*

375
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,570
*Who lives off the grid*

376
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,260
*You chased off Burns with a shotgun*

377
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,250
*That was such fun*

378
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,780
*And I love to drink*

379
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:17,750
*The methanol from your still*

380
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,230
*Ooh, you're my best friend*

381
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:25,740
*Ooh, you're my best friend*

382
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,840
*Ooh, I might not live*

383
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,830
*Ooh, you're my best friend*
