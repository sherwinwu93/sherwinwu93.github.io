没有阿门的祈祷

162
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,870
就像杜丝先生棒棒糖没有夹心

163
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,170
我要为想到了"杜丝先生"这个词道歉

But there must be a way

165
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,440
能吓得我儿子重拾信仰
to scare religion back into my son.

166
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,380
有什么人间地狱能让他去体验一下吗
Isn't there some hell on earth I could briefly place him in?

167
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,750
让我进去  儿子

你不用埋葬幸存者  他们是幸存者

我前几天洗了个澡
I took a shower earlier this week.

248
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,690

I can't. I can't.

249
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,300
托德在我们家的时候不行
Not with Todd in the house.

250
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,860
孩子们在家里已经有十年了

不是这个意思  他已经习惯安静了

我听得见

254
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,630
我们得把那孩子弄走
Oof! Got to get rid of that kid.

255
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,130
这可能吗
Can it be?

256
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,390
我的老天
Oh, my goodness!

257
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:14,980
我们救世主的脸在一片普通的面包上
The face of our Lord and Savior in a humble piece of toast?

258
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,380
很显然  没人能做到这个
Clearly, no human could have made this.

259
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,630
不是吗
Huh?

260
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,030
主说
And the Lord said,

261
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,870
"吃了它  因为我是镇上的吐司"

263
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,580
-是你画上去的  -不  不
- You drew that on. - No, no.

264
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,840
是上帝画上去的  他还签了名
God drew it on. Look, he signed it.

265
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,520
"椰稣"  看到了吗
"Jebus." See?

266
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,740
为什么上帝要把耶稣弄到吐司上
Why would God make toast that looked like Jesus?

267
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,640
因为父母总是炫耀孩子们的照片
'Cause parents are always showing off pictures of their kids?

268
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:44,590

*巴仔想要摆脱他*
*Bart wants to get rid of him*

274
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,940
这是托德
Yo, this is Todd.

275
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,460
我得和他住一间房  直到他重拾信仰
I have to share my room until he believes in God again.

276
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,360
你不信上帝吗  这太疯狂了
You don't believe in God? Well, that's crazy.

277
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,080
除了那博爱  万能的存在  谁还能创造出
Who else but an all-loving, omnipotent being

278
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,490
如此美好的扒裤子和拧乳头活动呢
could create beautiful wedgies and purple nurples?

279
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,470
别这么快下结论
Not so fast.

280
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,570
万一我才是宇宙中唯一的存在
What if I'm the only being in the universe,

281
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,340
而你们都只是我的心理投射呢
and you're all my mental projections?

282
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,030
投射这个吧
Project this!

283
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,970
我肯定很希望这事发生
I must have wanted this to happen!

284
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,100
既然你知道坏孩子是怎么形成的了
So now that you see how bad kids turn out,

285
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,770
你想回家了  对吗
you want to go home, right?

286
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,330
别再把我们当反例了
Stop using us as examples!

287
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,790
我觉得你的朋友们都会下地狱
I believe your friends are all going to Hell.

288
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,150
-没错  -太棒了
- Yeah! - Cool!

289
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,730
我听见你们了
I hear you!

290
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,950
为什么那个小笨蛋听到了
What doesn't that little twerp hear?

291
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:39,050
我不知道  但是我听到了
I don't know, but I heard that.

292
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,620
好了  他现在听不到我们了
Okay. He can't hear us now.

293
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,540
我能啊
Yes, I can.

294
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,350
你正在解开自己的衬衫  辛普森先生
You're unbuttoning your shirt, Mr. Simpson.

295
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,830
{\an8}这小孩必须走

296
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,520
纸上写的是什么
What does that paper say?

297
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,540
你好  托德
Oh. Hi, Todd.

298
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,230
还在寻找开悟吗
Still seeking enlightenment?

299
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,650
我跟你说了  现在不行
I told you, not now.

300
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:01,000
也许当我变成一只蠕虫回来的时候
Maybe I'll reconsider your stupid beliefs

301
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,540
会考虑一下你那愚蠢的信仰
when I come back as a worm.

302
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,060
在佛教里  这意味着你快要接受了
In Buddhism, that's halfway to "Yes"!

303
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,200
听着  托德  你没必要去信这个
Look, Todd, you don't have to believe.

304
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,920
在教堂里只要微笑点头  还可以打瞌睡
In church, just smile and nod, but be sleeping on the inside.

305
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,310
这在工作中也有效
That works at work, too.

306
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,150
但是我真的不相信
But I really don't believe.

307
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:17,650
我妈妈去世之后再也不回来让我很难过
I'm sad because my mommy's gone and never coming back.

308
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,170
你知道心里是什么滋味吗
You know how that feels?

309
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,580
我理解
Oh, do I.

310
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,770
不  不要再经历一遍了  不要
Oh, no, don't relive it. Don't!

311
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,400
你晚上10点都没回家吃晚饭
You don't come home for dinner till 10:00 at night.

312
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,260
你从来做不出任何值得吃的东西
You never cook anything worth eating.

313
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,220
谁想为一个失败者做饭呢
Well, who wants to cook for a failure?

314
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,380
天呐  女人  为什么你会嫁给我
Good God, woman, why did you marry me?

315
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,090
为了惹我妈生气  而且还见效了
To piss off my mother, and it worked!

316
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:38,600
告诉孩子我很爱他  但是我不善于告别
Tell the kid I love him, but I'm as bad at goodbyes

317
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,530
就像我不擅长选丈夫一样
as I am at picking husbands.

318
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,540
我妈妈离家出走了
My mom is gone.

319
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,190
我的冰激凌也不见了
And so is my ice cream.

320
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,300
我的头发也没了
And so is my hair!

321
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,640
老谋子  我要一醉方休  快点
Moe, I got to get drunk. And fast.

322
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,550
{\an8}没妈的孩子

323
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,450
我也来一杯
I'll take one, too.

324
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,360
怎么
What the...?!

325
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,580
我一无所有  给我一杯酒
I'm losing everything. Just give me a drink!

326
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,810
抱歉  弗兰德斯  我不能给你倒酒
I'm sorry, Flanders. I can't pour you a drink.

327
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,630
你人太好了  只是我爱莫能助
You're too good. It's just, it's not something I can do.

328
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,310
我求求你了
Please. I'm begging you.

329
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,940
好了  二十四美元
Yeah, that's $24.

330
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:17,750
*内德·弗兰德斯今天喝酒了*
*Ned Flanders is drinking today*

331
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:22,190
*哈利路亚*
*Allelujah*

332
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:26,920
*他的儿子误入歧途*
*His son Todd has gone astray*

333
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,270
*哈利路亚*
*Allelujah*

334
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,820
*举起你的酒杯一饮而尽*
*Raise your mug and drink it down*

335
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:40,330
*哈利路亚*
*Allelujah*

336
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:43,130
{\an8}小费

337
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:45,260
*在这座小镇最差的酒吧*
*In the worst bar in this town*

338
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:50,300
*哈利路亚*
*Allelujah*

339
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,060
侯默  我一直认为
You know, Homer, I always thought

340
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,720
你证明了上帝是存在的
you proved the existence of God.

341
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,620
你从悬崖上摔下来  但是人没事
I mean, you fall off cliffs, and you're fit as a fiddle.

342
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,050
那不是吹牛吗
Well, ain't that a diddle!

343
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,900
这就是
So this is what it's like

344
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,790
看不起别人的感觉
to look down on someone.

345
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,720
你知道吗  内德  也许
You know what, Ned? There may...

346
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,440
也许天堂不存在
there may not be a heaven,

347
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,450
但是和你一起喝醉感觉不是很糟
but getting drunk with you ain't hell.

348
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,560
你太好了
Oh, you're great.

349
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,900
这是一个很棒的开始
This is the beginning of a beautiful...

350
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,860
你撞死了他们
You killed them!

351
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,700
你是我遇到过最差的优步司机
This is the worst Uber ride ever!

352
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,370
我要给你四星了
You're getting four stars.

353
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:40,540
不
No...!

354
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,340
{\an8}天堂

355
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,130
{\an8}欢迎内德

356
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,300
{\an8}侯默也能来吗

357
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,400
欢迎来到天堂
Welcome to Heaven.

358
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,440
上帝  这和我想象中的一样美丽
Oh, Lord. It's just as beautiful as I pictured it.

359
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,500
这是你的想象  内德
This is your version, Ned.

360
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,650
侯默也有他的想象
Homer gets his, too.

361
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,490
我不觉得自己投入了很大的精力
So, not like I'm feeling I put in way too much work,

362
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,220
侯默也参与进来了吗
but Homer got in, too?

363
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:16,190
几年以前  懒惰成为了一种美德
Well, a couple of years ago, sloth became a virtue.

364
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,440
我不太明白
I don't really understand it.

365
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,050
你必须和我孩子谈谈
You'd have to talk to my kid.

366
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,360
他三十三岁还宅在家里
He's 33 and still lives at home.

367
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,360
我经历了一些事情  好吗
I've been through some stuff, man.

368
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,980
亚伯拉罕·林肯
Abe Lincoln!

369
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,290
你知道斯皮尔伯格
Did you know the picture

370
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:31,870
那部关于我生平的电影是最卖座的吗
about my life is Spielberg's biggest movie?

371
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:35,630
不  那《大白鲨》和《侏罗纪公园》系列
No! What about Jaws and E.T., and all the Jurassic...?

372
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,770
我在颁奖礼上表现如何
Well, how did I do in the awards?

373
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:40,060
-你打败了《逃离德黑兰》  -什么
- You were beaten by Argo. - Argo?!

374
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:44,100
那是我在影院里看过最糟糕的一部电影
That was the worst experience I ever had in a theater.

375
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,890
你们还有其他人要见
You have other people to see.

376
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:48,240
-带上通行证  -我们是访客
- Wear these passes. - Visitors?

377
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,400
真奇怪
Hmm, that's odd.

378
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,860
这一定说明你们的躯体还未死去
It must mean that your bodies aren't dead yet.

379
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:58,200
*我们需要你  上帝在上*
*We need you now oh God on high*

380
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:04,640
*别让愚蠢的弗兰德斯和侯默逝去*
*So stupid Flanders and Homer don't die*

381
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:07,960
内德·弗兰德斯  我向你保证我会倾尽所能
Ned Flanders, I swear to you I will use every ounce of skill

382
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,320
让你起死回生
in my body to bring you back to life.

383
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,360
那侯默怎么办
What about Homer?

384
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:14,160
顺其自然吧
Mm, que será, será.

385
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,720
天呐  他们在聚众祈祷
Oh, my. They're holding a vigil.

386
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,930
看爸爸一生曾经影响过多少人
Look how many, many lives Dad touched.

387
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,470
那是弗兰德斯的祈祷团
That's Flanders' vigil.

388
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,900
爸爸的在那边
Dad's is over there.

389
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:37,670
祈祷竟然占据了这份工作这么大的比重
Vigils are a surprisingly large part of this job.

390
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,820
噢耶  好悲伤
Oh, yeah! So sad!

391
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,640
爸爸的好是要慢慢品味的  丽莎
Dad's an acquired taste, Lis,

392
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,140
就像夏威夷比萨一样
like Hawaiian pizza.

393
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,370
爸爸可从来没有因为地域而歧视过披萨
Dad never judged a pizza by where it came from.

394
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,630
他都是先尝了再说
He just ate it.

395
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,170
上帝  现在只有你和我了
God, this is just you and me,

396
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,580
所以我要告诉你一个秘密
so I'm gonna tell you a secret.

397
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,300
我爱我的爸爸  请不要带走他
I love my dad, so please don't take him.

398
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,920
巴仔  你在祈祷什么呢
Bart, what are you praying for?

399
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,010
新单车
New bike.

400
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:04,390
你真的不想为了你爸爸祈祷吗
Are you sure you don't want to pray for your dad?

401
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,720
我没法祈祷
I can't pray.

402
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,220
没人听得到我的祈祷
I don't think anyone's listening anymore.

403
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,230
亲爱的  祈祷不一定要上帝听到
Oh, sweetie, prayer doesn't have to be to God.

404
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,820
也可以是我们与自己之间的
It can also just be an honest conversation

405
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,450
诚实的对话
we have with ourselves.

406
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,670
听从你的内心
Just do what your heart tells you.

407
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:21,740
我不知道现在是什么情况
Oh, I'm not really sure what's happening,

408
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,970
但我很难过  我需要帮助
but I'm really sad, and I need help.

409
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,240
{\an8}亲爱的上帝

410
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,970
{\an8}救救我爸爸

411
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,250
{\an8}抄送:耶稣

412
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,830
{\an8}以防万一也抄送给佛陀

413
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:29,370
*欢呼吧  雀跃吧*
*Rejoice, rejoice*

414
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:33,420
*在这春田镇*
*O Springfield town*

415
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,420
*因为在天之灵*
*'Cause what goes up*

416
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:39,770
*会回到凡间*
*Must come down*

417
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,880
{\an8}天堂

418
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,520
{\an8}达夫啤酒

419
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,100
每注投注我都赢了
I'm winning every bet!

420
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,740
而且也没有福克斯的中场广告
And there's no stupid Fox halftime show.

421
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,710
天堂竟然如此美好
Could Heaven be any better?

422
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,060
我同意  这里拥有我梦寐以求的一切
I agree. This is everything I could possibly dream of.

423
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,220
托德在祈祷  在为我祈祷
Todd is praying. He's praying for me.

424
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,560
管用了
And it's working!

425
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,410
我要回到家人身边了
I'm returning to my family!

426
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,450
再见  侯默
Bye, Homer.

427
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,040
-侯默  -妈妈
- Homer? - Mom?

428
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:17,860
现在我终于能亲口跟你道别了
I never got a chance to say goodbye, but now I can.

429
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,040
记住  我不喜欢拥抱
Remember, I'm not a hugger.

430
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,260
不好意思
Oh, right. Sorry.

431
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,730
你永远不用对我道歉
You never need to apologize to me.

432
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,510
在我眼中你是完美的
In my eyes, you're perfect.

433
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,480
在天堂不用墨守成规
Ah, we're in Heaven.

434
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,100
来抱一个
Come here, you.

435
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,630
我的天啊  我一直在幻想这一刻
Oh, my God, this is all I ever wanted!

436
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,010
可恶
Aw, damn it!

437
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,820
哈利路亚  我又回到了这美丽的世界
Hallelujah! I'm alive and back in this big beautiful world.

438
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,980
我要亲吻见到的第一件东西
I could kiss the first thing I see.

439
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,270
好吧  承诺就是承诺
Ah. Promise is promise.

440
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,760
-老侯  -爸爸
- Homie! - Dad!

441
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,290
-太好了  -太棒了
- Doughboy! - Yay!

442
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:51,780
爸爸  你回来了  我又相信上帝了
Daddy, you came back! I believe again!

443
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,980
祈祷拯救了两条生命
Two lives saved by prayer.

444
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:55,740
还有现代药品
And modern medicine.

445
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,670
这就是我成为医生的理由
This is why I became a doctor.

446
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,180
现在你们各欠我12000美金
Because you both owe me $12,000.

447
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,340
不行  不行
No, no, no, no.

448
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,670
涅槃是事成之后的奖励  你又没把事情办妥
Nirvana is for closers, and you couldn't close the deal.

449
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,580
-但是  但  -但什么但
- But-but... - But-but-but-but-but nothing!

450
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,310
你连托德·傅兰德斯都搞不定
You couldn't even close Todd frickin' Flanders!

451
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,140
那孩子看见蝴蝶都会去追
That kid would follow a butterfly.

452
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,020
再给我一次机会
Just give me one more chance.

453
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:20,790
难道我是靠耐心和容忍才成为佛陀的吗
Do you think I got to be Buddha by being patient?!

454
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:24,060
看这里  我带来了拉尔夫·韦根
Check this out. I got you Ralph Wiggum.

455
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,400
拉尔夫·韦根  我要拉尔夫·韦根有什么用
Ralph Wiggum? What am I gonna do with Ralph Wiggum?

456
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,460
一切皆成空
Everything is nothing!

457
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:32,820
孩子  你让我太震惊了
Kid, you just blew my mind.

458
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,380
晚安  罗迪
