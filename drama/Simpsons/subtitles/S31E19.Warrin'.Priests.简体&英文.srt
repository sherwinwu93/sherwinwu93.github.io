00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,400
B  三
"B" Thr-three.

157
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,510
我很乐意帮你把号码喊出来
You know, I'd be happy to yell out numbers for you.

158
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,580
让你少说话
Help save your voice.

159
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,500
宾戈游戏需要一位严肃且经验丰富的主持人
Bingo requires a firm, experienced caller.

160
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,300
G  G  四十八
"G" "G" 48.

161
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,310
N  四  N  四十三
"N" Four... "N" 43.

162
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,360
我啥也没有
I got nothing.

163
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,910
我想我能胜任
I think I can handle it.

164
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,380
我在神学院的时候
When I was in seminary school,

165
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,290
我是我们划船队里嗓门最大的人
I was the shouty guy on our rowing team.

166
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,770
我们当时不让说舵手这个词
We weren't allowed to say "Coxswain."

167
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,620
宾戈游戏不适合新手
Bingo is not for newbies.

168
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,330
字母的发音很容易混淆
The letters sound very similar.

169
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,710
B  十五
"B" 15.

170
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,460
{\an8}基督教传统中朝拜初生耶稣的东方三圣贤之一

171
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,460
B就是巴尔萨泽
"B" as in Balthazar.

172
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,560
他刚才说的是加尔萨泽吗
Did he say Galthazar?

173
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,510
中了
Gingo!

174
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,420
金格带你去厕所
Gingo take you to bathroom.

175
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,390
我不想去
I don't want to go.

176
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:01,430
这对我来说也太难了
Hey, this no picnic for Gingo either.

177
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,420
又空荡荡的
Empty again.

178
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,050
那两人只是过来亲热的
And those two just came here to make out.

179
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,840
如果我们在教堂做的话  就不能怀孕了
If we do it in a church, I, like, can't get pregnant.

180
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,770
早上
Uh, good mor...

181
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,080
抱歉
Excuse me.

182
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,860
兄弟姐妹们
Brothers and sisters,

183
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:32,710
勒弗乔伊牧师的嗓音有些问题
Reverend Lovejoy is experiencing some vocal difficulties.

184
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,330
少说话  牧师
Save your voice, Reverend.

185
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,580
现在  我们取消教堂活动
Now, we could cancel church.

186
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,560
上帝已经预见到了这次意外
But God clearly foresaw this

187
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,280
还派来了替补牧师帮忙完成礼拜
and sent us a backup pastor to finish the service.

188
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,160
教堂活动不会取消了
Church will not be canceled.

189
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:01,720
现在有请我们新来的年轻牧师伯德·莱特
Now please help me welcome our new youth minister Bode Wright.

190
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,000
谢谢  很谦恭  耶稣会喜欢的
Thanks. That's very meek. Jesus would've loved it.

191
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,680
我在想  当牧师在休整的时候
I was thinking, while the reverend rests his voice,

192
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,230
也许我们可以合唱一首歌
maybe we could all sing a song.

193
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,040
牧师  如果你同意的话  咳嗽一声
Uh, Rev, if that's okay with you, um, cough once.

194
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,480
我们不懂两声咳嗽是什么意思
We did not establish what two coughs means,

195
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,530
我就当作是两声同意了
so I'll take that to mean two yeses.

196
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,380
我们唱首歌好不好
Why don't we sing, I don't know,

197
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,090
《奇异恩典》怎么样  你们都熟悉这首
"Amazing Grace"? You all know that one.

198
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,670
如果不熟  这首歌在你的赞美诗集中
Or if you don't, it's in your hymnal under

199
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,430
《奇异  逗号  恩典》那里
"Grace, comma, amazing."

200
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,110
*奇异恩典  何等甘甜*
*Amazing grace, how sweet the sound*

201
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,840
*我罪已得赦免*
*That saved a wretch like me*

202
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,810
*前我失丧  今被寻回*
*I once was lost but now I'm found*

203
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,700
*也曾失明  如今复明*
*'Twas blind, but now I see.*

204
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,810
这是在白人教堂里发生过的
This is the most exciting thing that ever happened

205
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,600
最激动人心的事了
in a white church!

206
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,060
这么多年的恩典都平平无奇
All these years of mediocre grace.

207
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,380
终于有奇异恩典了
Finally, it's amazing.

208
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,360
耶稣基督的音乐会肯定
This must've been what it was like

209
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,260
就是这样
at Jesus's concerts.

210
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,980
谢谢你们  现在我们
Thank you. Now we'd,

211
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,320
我们来唱几首新圣歌
we'd like to do a couple of new psalms.

212
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,890
-*哈利路亚  哈利路*  -*哈利路亚*
- *Hallelujah, hallelu* - *Hallelujah*

213
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,470
*哈利路亚  哈利路*
*Hallelujah, hallelu*

214
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,800
哈利路亚
*Hallelujah*

215
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:20,670
教堂里正有大事发生
Something exciting's happening at the church.

216
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,150
我们去看看
Let's check it out.

217
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,360
好了  我想我们都懂  恩典是奇异的
All right, I think we get it. Grace, it's amazing.

218
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,660
我知道大部分人都会在礼拜结束前
I know most of you usually save your "Hallelujahs"

219
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,010
才唱《哈利路亚》
for when church is over.

220
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,520
我喜欢这种随意范儿
I adore the informality.

221
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,520
但如果可以的话  我想我或许可以
But if it's okay, I thought maybe I could just speak

222
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,760
与你们开诚布公地谈一谈
to you guys straight from my heart.

223
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,880
我事先没有任何准备
I don't have anything planned,

224
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,730
但我想我该谈谈有关上帝的事  对吧
but I guess I should talk about God, right?

225
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:40,970
身处教堂  身为牧师
Church. Pastor.

226
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,760
我是该谈谈有关上帝的事
Makes sense I should talk about God.

227
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,400
其实  我今早醒来的时候
But the truth is, I woke up this morning

228
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,750
不是很确定我是否信仰上帝
and I wasn't really sure if I believed in God.

229
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:48,910
没有上帝
No God?

230
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,070
堵住耳朵  孩子们
Fingers in your ears, boys.

231
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,460
堵得死死的
Till you can feel the brain.

232
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,210
没关系  没事的
It's okay. Everything's fine.

233
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,610
我  我只是醒来感觉有些疑虑
I-I just woke up with some doubt.

234
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,530
和在座的大多数人一样  我确定
Like many of you did, too, I'm sure.

235
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,130
世上有太多的伤痛和苦难
There's so much pain and suffering in the world,

236
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,490
我不确定是否真的有人在那里
I wasn't sure anyone was really out there.

237
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,070
在云端看着我们
Watching us. On a cloud.

238
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,340
这是我们想象中的上帝  是吧
That's how we think of God, right?

239
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,560
对于大多数人  上帝只是个监控无死角的
To many of us, God is just an angry, old miser

240
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,530
易怒的老吝啬鬼
with a killer surveillance system.

241
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,720
大家都挑吝啬鬼的刺儿
Everyone picks on the miser.

242
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,930
麻利点刮  不然没小费
Shave faster or no tip!

243
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,540
我麻利点  好的
I shave-a faster, all right.

244
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,350
快点  我要去出席葬礼
Hurry up. I'm going to a funeral.

245
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,090
您要去出席葬礼  好的
You're going to a funeral, all right.

246
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,290
这可真是磨洋工
This is taking too long.

247
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,930
我不能再这么拖延了
I got to stop procrastinating.

248
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,970
然后我静下心来思考这件事
Then I got quiet and thought about it.

249
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,610
我突然醒悟  上帝可能不在云端
It hit me that maybe God isn't up there, you know.

250
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:31,460
所谓的在别处
"Somewhere else."

251
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,220
上帝可能此刻就在这里
Maybe God's right here and now.

252
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,880
触手可及
As close as the air on your skin.

253
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,130
我第一次不再感到孤单
For the first time ever, I don't feel alone.

254
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,620
活着真美好
Life is worth living.

255
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,170
我雇你杀我的交易取消
Hey, forget that hit I called on myself, huh?

256
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,810
已经太迟了
Yeah, well, I said too late.

257
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,200
你就不能只收我跟踪费吗
Can't you just charge me a stalking fee?

258
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,490
好吧  百分之四十
Okay, 40%.

259
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,760
而且你只能在应用软件上取消
And you can only cancel on the app.

260
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,530
好吧  那我
All right, I-I'll just, uh...

261
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,290
我手机卡死了
My screen is frozen!

262
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,500
{\an8}已删除  消息读取失败
无法取消

263
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,950
或许上帝只是我们共同创造和铭记的
Maybe God is just a word for a love

264
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,930
爱的代名词
that we create and remember together.

265
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,030
这种爱不会因被质疑而气愤
A love that isn't mad at us for our doubt

266
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,650
不会因你是酒鬼而发怒
or angry at us because we're alcoholics.

267
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,540
终于  我的成就得到了认可
Finally, recognized for my accomplishments.

268
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,840
我们多数人心中的上帝都以自己为原型
I think so many of us have made a God that's like us,

269
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,360
而不是别的参照物
instead of the other way around.

270
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,710
上帝爱多样性
God loves diversity.

271
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,480
他不止创造了一种花
God didn't just make one type of flower.

272
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,800
世间存在着数以千计的品种
He made thousands of different flowers--

273
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,600
玫瑰  百合  兰花
roses, lilies, orchids--

274
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,930
野草也同时生出
and He made the weeds, too.

275
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,350
但他一视同仁
But He loves all of them indiscriminately.

276
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,400
像蜜蜂那样
Just like the bees.

277
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,040
你令本骄傲黄蜂人感到羞愧
You have made this bumblebee a humble bee.

278
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,510
耶稣曾说  "让野草和麦子一同生长"
Jesus said, "Let the weeds grow with the wheat."

279
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,220
这意味着它们都得到了上帝的庇护
That means it's all in the game.

280
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,360
跟自己和解吧
Go easy on yourself.

281
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,400
你无需去赢得上帝的爱
You don't have to earn God's love.

282
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,140
你就是上帝的爱
You are God's love.

283
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,160
好  就到这吧
All right, that's it.

284
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,100
虽然很早  但天气这么好
I know it's early, but it's a beautiful day.

285
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,230
咱们出去吧
Let's get out of here.

286
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,740
耶稣巡演

287
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,280
抱歉哥们  演唱会结束了
Sorry, concert's over, dude.

288
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,960
就剩周边了
All that's left is the merch.

289
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,190
伯德  伯德  伯德
Bode! Bode! Bode!

290
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:51,460
伯德  伯德  伯德
Bode! Bode! Bode!

291
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,290
为勒弗乔伊神父欢呼三声
Three cheers for Reverend Lovejoy.

292
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,610
蠢弗兰德斯
Stupid Flanders.

293
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:58,350
蠢弗兰德斯  蠢弗兰德斯
Stupid Flanders! Stupid Flanders!

294
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,000
我爱做礼拜
I love church.

295
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,220
那我在天堂不会孤单了
I won't be single in Heaven.

296
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,200
这是我做过的最好的礼拜
This was the best church ever.

297
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,670
就像某种宗教新体验似的
It was like some kind of religious experience.

298
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,550
愿意跟我们一起去吃煎饼吗
Will you join us for pancakes?

299
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,940
这是新祭服吗
Are those new vestments?

300
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,540
虔诚得熠熠生辉
They really bring out the piety.

301
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,670
你不必同情地奉承我  内德
You don't have to patronize me, Ned.

302
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,160
你说得对  对不起
You're, y-you're right, I'm sorry.

303
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,180
你今天表现挺糟糕的
Y-You did not do well today.

304
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,430
还是同情吧
Oh, go back to patronizing.

305
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,810
要不说说我的鞋
Maybe something about my shoes?

306
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:28,600
看看这鞋  系得这么紧  成圈也均匀
Oh, look at those shoes, tied so tight with loops so even.

307
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,970
看来某人掌握了兔子耳系带技巧
Someone knows the bunny ear technique.

308
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,180
海伦系的
Helen tied them.

309

{\an8}更美好餐厅
煎饼  华夫饼  棒球收藏品

310
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,320
牧师  你愿意做祷告吗
Uh, Pastor, would you like to say grace?

311
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:37,700
主啊
Lord--

312
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,530
抱歉  我没说准确
Oh, sorry, I should have been more specific.

313
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,040
我是指大家都喜欢的新来的酷牧师
I meant the cool new pastor everyone likes.

314
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,900
你坐吧
You can sit down.

315
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,240
我觉得不需要我说
You know, I think the food is good

316
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,730
这饭菜本身就是美味的
without me saying it's good.

317
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,830
上帝让它美味可口
God made it good.

318
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,870
别误会  有感激之心是好事
Don't get me wrong, it's nice to be thankful, but

319
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,720
但是也没必要对着饭菜祈祷
there's no need to make everyone uncomfortable

320
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,720
搞得所有人都不舒服  对吧
by praying in front of 'em, am I right?

321
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,690
说得不错  就是比饭前祷告还长
Nice speech, although longer than grace.

322
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,880
我不吃培根
Oh, no bacon for me.

323
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,380
我是素食主义者
I'm a vegetarian.

324
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,980
其实我信佛
And, actually, a Buddhist.

325
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,310
挺好  我喜欢佛教
Great. I love Buddha.

326
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,560
我就是因此得名
That's where I got my name.

327
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,540
菩提树
The Bodhi Tree.

328
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,670
我也不吃肉
And I don't eat meat either.

329
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,160
你也是素食主义者吗
You're a vegetarian?

330
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,080
-那进化呢  -我信
- What about evolution? - Into it.

331
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,480
-同性恋权益呢  -大爱无边
- Gay rights? - Love is love.

332
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,620
迪兹还是大鸟
Dizzy or Bird?

333
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,620
{\an8}大鸟及查理·帕克  二人曾合作录音

334
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,540
约翰·柯川和艾灵顿公爵  1962年
John Coltrane and Duke Ellington, 1962.

335
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,540
{\an8}柯川与公爵在1962年合作了爵士专辑

336
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,670
要形容你刚对于爵士问题的回答有多完美
The only way to describe how perfect

337
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,330
最好的方式就是用爵士乐
that jazz answer is, is with jazz.

338
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,730
这顿早午饭已经变成了
This brunch has turned into...

339
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,870
爵士早午饭
a jazz brunch!

340
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,710
我是个信徒
I'm a believer.

341
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,540
挺好的  丽莎  但我真的觉得
That's great, Lisa, but I actually don't think

342
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,540
信仰不会归结为我们相信的东西
faith comes down to what we believe.

343
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,750
你总得相信这些鬼话
Well, you got to believe in this baloney.

344
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,250
你就是这么上天堂的
That's how you get into Heaven.

345
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,470
或许  就是或许  我在天堂
Where maybe, just maybe, I could see

346
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,330
还能再见到遗弃我的妈妈
the mother that abandoned me again.

347
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,750
{\an8}把篮子还给我

348
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,680
是没错  但是我觉得只要合作
Yeah, sure, but I think together

349
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,280
我们就能在生时  把人间变成天堂
we can bring Heaven here while we're still alive.

350
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,630
有句中国谚语是说天堂与地狱的
There's a Chinese proverb about Heaven and Hell.

351
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,440
他们说地狱有张这样长的桌子  满是美食
They say Hell is a long table like this, full of food,

352
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,150
但是每个人都挨着饿  因为筷子很长
but everybody's starving because they have these long chopsticks,

353
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,950
就像台球杆  所以他们没法把食物吃进嘴
like pool cues, and they can't bring the food to their mouths.

354
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,340
这是最难受的牛年了
This is the worst Year of the Ox ever.

355
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:11,010
但是谚语中  天堂也是同样的桌子和食物
But in the proverb, Heaven is the exact same table, same food,

356
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,620
同样长的筷子  但是所有人幸福温饱
same long chopsticks, but everybody's happy and fat

357
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,230
因为他们互相喂吃的
because they're feeding each other.

358
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:19,680
等等  我也懂幽默
Wait, wait! I can be cool, too... with humor.

359
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,810
你们听没听过希腊人和犹太人结婚的笑话
Did you hear the one about the Greek-Jewish wedding?

360
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,900
他们不知道该摔盘子还是摔杯子
They didn't know whether to break the plates or the glasses!

361
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,900
{\an8}按照习俗  希腊人摔盘子  犹太人摔杯子

362
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,980
你怎么不带着你的文化漠视
Yes, why don't you take your cultural insensitivity

363
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,240
回你该回的西班牙异端裁判所去
back to the Spanish Inquisition you came from?

364
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,240
{\an8}15世纪设立于西班牙的罗马天主教会组织  因残酷迫害异教而知名

365
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,100
我失去他们了
I've lost them.

366
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,690
你从来就不拥有我们
You never had us.

367
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:38,860
{\an8}勒弗乔伊神父

368
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,930
提默西  教会想感谢你
Timothy, the church council wants to thank you

369
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,910
多年来的
for your many years of...

370
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,370
无能
Incompetence!

371
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,650
把他的神父服扒了
Knock his frock off.

372
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,040
我们喜欢穿着紧身牛仔裤的新人
We like the new guy in his tight jeans.

373
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,280
别想着事业复苏
Do not resuscitate your career.

374
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,360
你们在说什么  要解雇我吗
What are you saying? You're firing me?

375
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,020
-金格  -请上交你的十字架
- Gingo. - Please surrender your cross.

376
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,440
我们不想惹麻烦
We don't want any trouble.

377
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,610
提默西
Timothy.

378
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,590
现在调领子
Now the collar.

379
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,280
{\an8}停止服务

380
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,110
任何你转化过的圣水
And any water you turned into holy water

381
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,260
现在都变成普通的水了
is once again regular water.

382
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,490
都是自来水
Nothing but tap.

383
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,150
你知道伯德在油管上有两万二千个粉丝吗
Did you know Bode has 22,000 YouTube subscribers?

384
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,710
我们的教堂要火了
Our church could go viral.

385
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:32,200
关闭窗口
Ugh. Close window.

386
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:34,390
-你刚刚订阅了  -什么  不要
- You just subscribed. - What? No.

387
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,940
你刚给他点了个赞
Now you gave him a thumbs-up.

388
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,460
别唠叨了
Stop telling me what I just did.

389
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,580
你刚给他发送了一个茄子表情
You just gave him an eggplant emoji.

390
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,960
至少这表情不会造成误解
Well, at least that can't be misconstrued.

391
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,940
等等
Wait a minute.

392
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,630
我可以利用网络  找点他的黑历史
The Internet can help me. Help me find something on him.

393
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,160
谷歌上什么都搜不到
He's clean on Google.

394
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,580
我去必应搜搜看
I'll have to try Bing.

395
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,360
不好意思  刚刚睡着了
Sorry, I was asleep.

396
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,460
你确定要用我们搜索吗
Do you really want to use us?

397
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:54,380
是的
Yes.

398
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,190
啥也没有
Hmm. Nothing.

399
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,880
但我不认输
But I'm not licked.

400
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,240
准备好行李  海伦
Pack your bags, Helen.

401
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,320
我们出发去密歇根
We are going to Michigan.

402
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,680
牧师  我们来做咨询
Reverend? We're here for a little counseling?

403
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:09,650
乐意效劳
Well, I'd be happy to.

00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,940
但你们身边已经有最棒的顾问了
But you're already with the best counselor there is.

405

你们彼此

406
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,270
等等  马姬总是和我说
Wait. But Marge always told me

407
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,510
交流对婚姻是有害的
communication is bad for a marriage.

408
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,250
我是说有益
I said it was good.

409
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,420
你说什么有益
You said what was good?

410
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,670
你们只是需要
You just have to know what it's like

411
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,230
站在对方的角度考虑[穿对方的鞋]
to be in each other's shoes.

412
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,010
我说真的  把鞋子换一下
Literally. Put on each other's shoes.

413
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:24,740
现在
Right now.

414
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,300
那好吧
All right then.

415
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,130
你的鞋太紧了
Your shoes are so tight.

416
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,940
还要每天穿着做家务
And you do so much work.

417
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,530
你真是个天使
You're an angel.

418
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,240
你的鞋太重了
And your shoes are so heavy.

419
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,870
我从来不知道你有这么重的负担
I never realized you carried around so much.

420
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:44,230
我仿佛又见到了令我倾心的那个男人
I'm starting to see the man I fell in love with again.

421
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,440
在哪呢  在哪  我杀了他
Where? Where? I'll kill him!

422
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,760
是你
You.

423
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,910
不得不说  这感觉真好
I must admit, this is amazing.

424
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,260
但他把我们的房子卖了这事怎么处理
But what about the fact that he sold our house?

425
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,480
-我能插句话吗  -当然
- Um, may I interject? - Sure.

426
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,400
我见过你们的房子  肯定没法通过检查
I've seen your house. It'll never pass inspection.

427
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,310
-你确定吗  -惨不忍睹
- Are you sure? - Piece of crap.

428
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,810
谢谢你  牧师
Thank you, Reverend.

知道吗  科学上称之为"意识"
You know, science calls it consciousness,

437
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,300
神秘学上称之为"灵魂"  但终究只是代称
the mystics call it a soul, but both are just words,

438
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,090
只是标签罢了  不论如何称呼它
just labels, for whatever it is

439

Yeah, let these warm your insides

454
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,120
就像圣保罗温暖你们的灵魂一样

亲爱的《以弗所书》

457
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,300
当然了  以下是我改写的
and I'm, of course, paraphrasing here--

458
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,790
信奉基督  否则我就用球棒敲你的头
believe in Christ or I'll hit your head with a baseball bat.

459
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,100
我肯定会照做的
I'll frickin' do it.

460
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,590
阿门
Amen.

461
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,780
我不是想改变人们的想法
Hey, I'm-I'm not trying to change any minds.

462
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,120
我只是想试着开始跟人交谈
I'm just trying to start a conversation.

463
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,190
我们需要这个  这小镇就像个雪花玻璃球
We need that. This town's like a snow globe.

464
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:17,720
看起来压根不像  除非你摇晃一下
It doesn't look like much till you shake it up a little.

465

否则什么
Or else what?

467
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,980
否则曼凯维奇拉比[犹太教教士]就会替代你  老兄
Or Rabbi Mankiewicz will, dude.

468
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,720
我不太会发那个"光"音
And I have trouble making that "Cch" Sound.

469
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,990
要么是"哐明节"  要么就是"咣明节"
It's either Chanukah or Hanukkah.

470
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,720
好吗  选一个吧
Okay? Pick one of those.

471

教会一个人用微缩胶片
Teach a man to microfiche,

474
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,030
你就会让他一辈子背负耻辱
and you'll feed him dirt for a lifetime.

475
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:47,990
大仇将报  吾如是说
Vengeance is mine, sayeth the me.

476
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,790
我们真该把那东西数字化的
We really should've digitized that stuff.

477
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,620
{\an8}未完待续

478
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,370
但愿第二部是关于营救我的
Oh, I hope part two is about my rescue.

479
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,340
{\an8}不  并不是

{\an8}帅气牧师在复活节被罢免

485
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,640
你  先生  因为《圣经》质疑了我
You, sir, have challenged me on scripture.

486
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,080
如果你想说《圣经》的话
Oh, well, if it's scripture you want to talk,

487
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,970
那我们就“全地都要向耶和华欢乐”
then let us make a joyful noise unto the Lord.

488
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,970

00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:36,280
如果激进主义不查收要它还有何用
Yarr, activism means nothing if it's not intersectional. Yarr!
