00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,190
我要溜了  陷阱门去哪了
I got to get out. Where's the trap door?

160
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,340
救救我
Save me.

161
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,650
财务室的温斯坦  你认识的
You know Weinstein from Accounting.

162
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,990
要是你觉得困惑
If you're confused,

163
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:01,570
或许这两位能帮你清醒一下
perhaps these two gentlemen can clarify things.

164
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,930
这位喜欢制造痛苦
This fellow loves inflicting pain.

165
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,340
这位则喜欢在另一位制造痛苦的时候
And this fellow loves to laugh while he watches

166
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,830
在一边站着大笑
this one produce the pain.

167
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,310
你是制造痛苦的那个  还是大笑的那个
Are you the pain guy or the laugh guy?

168
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,060
问你话呢
Answer the question.

169
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,140
有人吗  阿麦来参加玩耍聚会了

地板是什么材质
What is this floor made out of?

174
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,880
是一座威尼斯教堂的瓷砖
The tile was a Venetian church

175
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,540
我们把它拆除  用小船运了回来

176
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,270
再由99岁高龄的贝聿铭精心安装
and had lovingly installed by a 99-year-old I.M. Pei.

177
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,640

178
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,840
不  卫生间的装修才叫贵
No, the toilet is pricey.

179
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,880
我们雇的水管工效率太低了
The plumbers we hired to replace it are very inefficient.

180
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,420
再使点劲  你们这群小矮子
Let's go, you little runts.

181
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,200
怎么  尿布满了吗

你填这份性史表的时候想来点咖啡吗
Would you like some coffee as you fill out a sexual history?

183
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,260
性史表
Sexual history?

184
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,290
然后我们的宝宝才能成为朋友吗
So our babies can be friends?

185
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,310
这里是我的
Here's mine.

186
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,150

现在已经很少看到婴儿用奶嘴了
So unusual to see a baby with a pacifier these days.

190

{\an8}婴儿杀手剂

00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,840
你宝宝的头发好有趣哦
Your baby has such interesting hair.

192
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,760
你不介意我给她装上保护措施
You don't mind that I babyproofed your baby

193
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,430
-来保护我的宝宝对吧  -我介意
- from my baby, do you? - Yes, I do.

00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,740
而且我们不会再回来了
And we're not coming back.

197
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,740
{\an8}斯帕科勒家

198
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,230
兄弟干嘛呢
Whatcha doing there, friend?

203
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,270
"好的"就完事儿了
Nothing like a good "a-yup"

204
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,680
-能让人放松下来  -好的

205
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,610
-好的  -好的
- A-yup. - A-yup.

206
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,780
-好的  -不好
- A-yup. - A-nope.

207
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,320
我是说  好的
I mean, a-yup.

208
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,400
朋友
Say, friend,

209
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,520
我看到你用嘴吸氦气再吐到
looks like you're working awful hard

210
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,020
聚酯薄膜气球里挺费劲的
to suck the helium into them thar Mylar balloons.

211
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,880
可不  累惨了
Oh, it's powerful tiresome.

212
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,050
但上帝既然把氦气埋在我家地下
But the Lord done put helium under my feet,

213
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,360
我就不能让它白白飘散
and I must not spill it into the sky.

214
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,590
现在听着
Now, listen.

215
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,600
跟他说你有办法让他活得更轻松
Explain that you have a way to make his life easier.

216
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,020
假装是你的主意
Pretend it's your idea.

217
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,930
他是能相信你会有主意的那种傻瓜
He's stupid enough to believe you have an idea.

218
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,690
就说"要是我说我知道一个办法

219
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,010
能轻松收集这天赐的氦气呢"
there was a way to harvest that noble gas?"

220
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,680
"要是我说我知道一个办法
"What if I told you there was a way

221
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,030
能轻松收集这天赐的氦气呢
to harvest that noble gas

222
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,680
不需要你嘴费劲
without the strain on your mouth puffer."

223
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,280
我会说  "切"
I'd say, "Aw, pshaw,"

224
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,990
然后让你"继续"
but then I'd follow it with a "Go on."

225
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,400
很好
Excellent.

226
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,160
"很好"
"Excellent."

227
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,950
不  别说很好
No, don't say excellent.

228
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,830
"不  别说很好"
"No, don't say excellent."

229
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,000
这句也别说
No, don't say that, either.

230
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,330
"这句也别说"
"No, don't say that, either."

231
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,000
你闭嘴吧
Just shut up.

232
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,390

00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,010
特别是最后那句
especially that last crazy part.

235
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,970
省了不少活啊
You just saved me a passel of work.

236
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,970
现在我有空生更多孩子了
Now I can spend more time making more family.

237
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,570
侯默·杰·辛普森

240
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,240
抓点鲶鱼吧
and get ourselves a mess of catfish.

241
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,190
我把胳膊深深插进鲇鱼洞里
All right, I'm gonna get my arm so deep into that catfish hole,

242
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:33,120
就会有傻鲶鱼上钩
that ole chucklehead just bites my bone.

243
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,920
小菜一碟
Easy-peasy.

244
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,210
别吓到它  会让鱼肉变酸
Now, don't scare him. It sours up the flavor.

245
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,800
它在舔我的眼睛
It's licking my eye.

246
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,010
死了吗
Is it dead?

247
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,410
谢谢你
Thank you.

248
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,060
没有什么比斯帕科勒家传统炸鱼宴更好了
All right, nothing like a good ole Spuckler family fish fry.

249
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,070
主啊  谢谢你把这个
Dear Lord, thank you for bringing

250
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,410
没毛的沼泽猛兽带给我们
this hairless swamp beast our way.

251
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,960
他对于您神秘气球气的智慧
His wisdom regarding your mystery balloon gas

252
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,230
帮助我们斯帕科勒一家有了两台收音机
has helped us Spucklers become a two-radio family.

253
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,580
侯默  我想做你的合作伙伴

254
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,060
交个杯来成交吧  来吧
Seal the deal with a hillbilly handshake. Come on.

我现在也把你当家人了
I consider you family now,

256
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,510
其实也没多少人好选
which is not really that select a circle.

257
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,870
{\an8}负鼠意面

258
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,700
-很好  -哪里来的声音
- Excellent. - Where'd that come from?

259
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,750
干得好  辛普森  我们会夺走他的一切
Well done, Simpson. We'll take him for everything

260
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,600
除了草坪上的沙发
except the couch on his lawn.

261
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,300
但我们是一家人了
Well, but we're family.

262
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,400
你就不能整他个半死吗
Couldn't you just screw him half over?

263
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,290
整人不能只整个半死
No one screws anyone half over.

264
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,110
就像是只拿十亿美元的一半  有意义吗
It's like having half a billion dollars. What's the point of that?

265
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,070
怎么了
What's up?

266
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,640
我觉得我们都不开心  但我担心你会先说
I think we're both upset, but I'm worried you're gonna talk first.

267
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,270
不  你先说
No, you go ahead.

268
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:12,370
我要整死一个对我非常好的家伙
I'm supposed to screw over a guy that's only been nice to me.

269
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:14,310
我让阿麦开心不起来
I'm denying Maggie happiness

270
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,890
就因为我受不了她朋友的妈
because I can't stand the mother of her friend.

271
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,070
阿麦没事的
Maggie'll be fine.

272
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,450
我才刚跟她一起玩了
I just played with her.

273
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,190
她还以为我拿了她的鼻子
She still thinks I've got her nose.

274
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,480
等下  我放哪里去了
Wait, where'd I put it?

275
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,100
不在这里
Not here.

276
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,750
不  不在
No. No.

277
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,630
看看你找到了什么
Look what you found.

278
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,950
{\an8}哈德森周岁典礼

279
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,110
有些事我得告诉你
I have something I need to tell you.

280
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,730
哈德森办了个生日派对
Hudson had a birthday party,

281
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,680
但是我没告诉你  你就错过了
but I didn't tell you, so you missed it.

282
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,130
我可以解释
I can explain.

283
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,610
他的妈妈太讨人厌了
That other mom was just so annoying

284
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,450
她有什么空中绸带  还有瑜伽裤
with her aerial silks and those yoga pants.

285
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,630
她做普拉提  又不是瑜伽
She does Pilates, not yoga.

286
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,870
她让我自惭形秽
She made me feel bad about myself.

287
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,600
你明白的  对吧  对吧
You get it, right? Right?

288
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,860
让他把这合同签了  辛普森
Get this contract signed, Simpson.

289
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,160
不然呢
Or what?

290
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,750
或许你该稍微尝尝等着你的东西
Perhaps you need a little taste of what's in store.

291
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,670
抱歉了  史密瑟斯
Sorry, Smithers.

292
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:20,190
我们不想留一个克里塔斯能看见的印子
We didn't want to leave a mark that Cletus could see.

293
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,050
但是你本来可以先警告我一下
But you could've warned me first.

294
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,670
说得对  小心身后
Fair enough. Watch your back.

295
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,040
这不是我全世界
Well, if it ain't my bestest friend

296
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,060
最好的朋友吗
on God's flat Earth.

297
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,180
你手里拿的什么
So, what's in your hand?

298
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,060
是我们友谊的证明吗
Some sort of a friendship certificate?

299
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,670
你懂的  只是
Uh, you know, just something

300
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:42,280
让我们的合作关系更进一步的协议
to put our partnership on the up-and-up.

301
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,870
有什么比氦气生意更棒的吗
Hey, what's more up-and-up than the helium business?

302
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,840
你不打算先读一下吗
Ain't you gonna read it?

303
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,650
我相信你  像小羊羔相信友善的大灰狼一样
I trust you, like a sheep trusts a friendly wolf.

304
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,140
我要签个X
I signs with an "X"

305
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,680
因为我的手机是iPhone X
'cause that's the kind of iPhone I got.

306
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,190
第二笔写完  协议就正式生效了
And now for the second slash that makes it official.

307
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,880
我需要一把直尺
Oh, I need a straightedge.

308
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,410
直尺  过来  儿子
