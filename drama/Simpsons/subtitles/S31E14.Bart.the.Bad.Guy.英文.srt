20
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,510
Now that I, Chinnos, finally wield the Doomsday App,

21
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,760
I can restart this planet in flames,

22
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,220
as a utopia.

23
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,470
I don't know, Chinnos. You say "utopia,"

24
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,260
but what I'm hearing is "kill everyone."

25
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,100
And I really don't want to find a new dry cleaner.

26
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,270
Your funny-but-not-too-funny banter

27
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,850
will not save you, Magnesium Man.

28
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,980
Yeah, but it did distract you, didn't it, Dad Bod?

29
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,430
Take him, Airshot!

30
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,030
Yes, Airshot, pump that air gun!

31
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,310
Five pumps? Think of the pressure.

32
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,900
Aw, what's the matter? Bad head day?

33
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,200
It's time I took the Vindicators out of the equation.

35
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,580
I'll take that dance now.

36
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:26,010
Their first kiss was their last.

38
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,500
It was called Crystal War

39
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,630
because they were all turned to crystals.

40
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:53,300
Hey, now is not the time for your cold-hearted analysis.

41
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,930
The sequel isn't coming out for a year.

42
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:58,930
What loving God would make us wait that long?

43
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,310
A year? That's, like, a million years.

44
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,270
I cannot wait. Don't you leave me,

45
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,920
you be-cape-ed gob-smashers!

48
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,610
Children, I pulled you out of your classes today

49
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,240
to warn you of a dangerous new Internet trend.

50
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,290
The paprika challenge?

51
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,200
The eight ball challenge?

52
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,960
No, the highly-imitatable stunt I'm referring to

54
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,650
is the "flag yourself" challenge.

55
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,960
Instead of a merely verbal warning,

56
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,260
it's clear to me a more effective deterrent

57
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,970
would be to show you a video of the stunt

58
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:40,760
performed by YouTube star Reaction Guy.

59
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,810
Whoa, Reaction Guy?

60
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,770
Everybody who's anybody gets reacted to by him.

61
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,230
Watch and learn... to not do this.

62
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,860
What up, Reaction Faction? It's your boy, Reaction Guy.

63
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,780
Today I'm gonna be reacting to the Flag Yourself Challenge.

64
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,490
Shout-out to my crew, Hedgehog, Thin Mint, and White Malik.

65
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,270
They're gonna raise me like a flag.

66
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,020
this is so clench!

68
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,070
Wow, cool!

70
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,220
Hey, guys, this is Bart Simpson

71
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,510
from my new channel, Reaction Bart.

72
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,850
Big shout-out to my boy White Seymour for putting me onto

73
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,430
the Flag Yourself Challenge. So clench!

75
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,980
Okay, hit it. Check it out.

76
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,190
I'm waving at my haters and they don't even know it.

77
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,050
Clench! Clench!

78
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,430
Buy my merch.

79
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:37,470
Merch to come. Merch!

80
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,700
His obliques must be shredded.

81
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,860
I got to check them out next time we go swimming.

82
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,590
Milhouse, no!

83
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,240
I need your passcode to upload the video.

85
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,450
Yo, Milhouse, I got you a balloon form the gift shop.

88
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,080
So what'd the doctors say?

89
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,520
I have a full-body sprain.

90
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,860
Most of my muscles are wrapped around the wrong bones.

91
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,030
Okay, champ, physical therapy time.

92
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,440
Who's ready for four hours of stretch bands?

93
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,560
No, not the purple.

94
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,190
Glucose?

95
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,440
Don't mind if I do-cose.

96
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,500
Okay, mate, you can do this.

97
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,460
It's hard, but those little buggers are counting on you.

98
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,530
Do it for the buggers.

99
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,020
Top of the bing-bong, ladies.

100
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,190
- You're Glen Tangier. - You're Airshot.

101
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,030
Good on you, Nightingales.

102
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,390
Now, who can point me towards, uh,

103
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,530
"Milhouse Van Houten"?

104
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,600
Ooh, right down the hall and to the left, Glen.

105
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,870
Flirt much, Debby?

106
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,580
Sorry, we can't all be married to

107
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,820
Ogdenville's car detailing king Duke Druthers.

108
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,000
What's up, little bro?

109
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,760
How's my favorite real-life superhero?

110
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,580
Holy crap, you're Glen Tangier.

111
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,510
Never heard of him.

112
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,870
The name's Airshot.

113
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,520
You're my favorite Vindicator.

114
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,090
You don't even have any powers, you're just super good at air.

115
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,110
Uh, easy now. Don't get too excited, Milhouse.

116
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,300
Oh, I'm not...

117
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,930
I am Milhouse.

118
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,200
That's right. Calm down, hero.

119
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,730
Don't make whatever you have worse.

120
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:54,040
Is it something that gets worse? Please don't say it gets worse.

121
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,210
Oh, don't worry, Airshot, I'm okay.

122
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:00,110
Well, aren't you just Pimm to the brim with Adelaide spunk?

123
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,880
Oh, thank boomerang Jesus

124
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,510
you're not one of those brave little buggers

125
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,160
that I have to show this to.

126
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,140
Wait, what do you got in there?

127
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,060
Oh, it's a laptop with the sequel

128
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,420
to the Vindicators: Crystal garbage.

129
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,800
All that matters is you're gonna be okay, mate.

130
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,450
Never wanted to be an actor anyway,

131
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:28,270
just a simple koala butcher like me old man.

132
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,900
Yo, Airshot. Glen.

134
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,570
Hello.

136
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,370
Sweet boomerang Jeebus.

137
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,400
What an ending.

138
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,720
People are gonna freak out when they see it...

139
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,230
in a month from now.

140
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:07,740
Till then, I'm the only one that knows what happens.

141
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,180
Only I know.

142
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:14,560
I'm the most powerful kid in the world.

143
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,210
Toss that Kanga shank into the billy-boil.

144
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,990
It'll be tender by moon jump.

146
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,550
Yo, Fat Thor, I've seen Vindicators: Crystal War 2.

147
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,430
- You blaspheme! - My buddy Airshot showed it to me.

148
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,430
Ha. I repeat, ha.

150
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,520
As if Glen Tangier, the Tasmanian Adonis,

151
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,180
would deign to interact with someone of your insignificance.

152
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:53,080
You are defeated, Vindicator.

153
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,730
Not as long as I'm still breathing.

154
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,420
Sweet batarang Jesus. Tell me more.

155
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,750
The first taste was free,

156
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,970
the next is gonna cost you.

157
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:12,250
I've had my eye on that Dr. 3 A.M. graphic novel.

158
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,560
Okay, strap yourself in. The way it goes down is...

159
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,020
But pause. The knowledge you offer

160
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,960
would spoil the movie event of the year.

161
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,520
Nay, century.

162
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,130
Nay, epoch.

163
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,340
Nay, summer.

164
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:26,820
Tell me nothing.

165
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,760
Ah, but my curiosity consumes me.

166
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,820
All right, here's the deal, the movie starts on the logo...

167
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,490
Silence!

168
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,810
Speak!

169
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,650
Speak not.

170
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,310
Expound!

171
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,960
I pass the test. I will diminish

172
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,440
and remain Comic Book Guy.

173
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,610
Ooh, shrimp.

174
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:53,410
What would you give me not to find out what happens?

175
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,420
Be gone, Spoiler Boy.

176
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,130
Spoiler Boy.

177
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:00,880
I like that.

178
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,360
That's the kid who saw Vindicators: Crystal War 2: Resurgence.

179
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,030
Do what he says or he'll spoil the ending.

180
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,600
I must protect my virgin ears.

181
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,710
I think you can do better than that.

182
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,000
Four chicken lumpettes per person.

183
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,300
Even if that person knows which Vindicator

184
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,920
loses a third of their powers fighting Karate Scorpion?

185
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,720
Zip it. My boyfriend's taking me to see that movie

187
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,000
when it gets to the two-dollar theater.

189
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,190
Simpson, you're getting one day of detention

190
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,880
for every extra lumpette you eat.

191
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,360
Detention, is it?

192
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,610
I guess we'll have plenty of time to discuss

193
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,270
the fate of your favorite Vindicator, Black Voodoo.

195
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,330
The champion of the French Quarter.

196
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,790
You wouldn't dare spoil the only thing

197
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,500
that brings me joy in this world.

198
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,860
Give me your toupee.

199
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,110
Toupee?

200
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,250
I don't wear a toupee.

201
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,620
We fade in on Bourbon Street...

204
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,770
Principal Skinner. T-To what do we owe the honor, sir, at-

205
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,290
Oh, it's just you.

206
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,810
how'd you get all this stuff?

207
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,480
'Cause people do whatever I say

208
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,820
or I spoil the Vindicators movie for them.

209
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,730
Like so:

210
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,860
tell Mom it's okay for me to have soda on my cereal.

211
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,320
I don't know. Mom's not gonna go for that.

212
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,280
Okay. Get ready to hear the surprise ending.

213
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,640
Let me guess. The good guys win.

214
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,330
Who told you?

215
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,790
You can't spoil that movie for me,

216
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,540
because I don't care what happens.

217
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,290
You see, as a grown-up,

218
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,920
I know that muscle jerks in tights with magic powers

219
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,920
punching and hugging each other

220
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,880
is boring BS for babies.

221
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,850
So go ahead, tell me what Captain Doodad does

222
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,180
to Zippity whoever.

223
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,460
Because it means nothing.

224
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,750
My powers don't work on you.

225
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,800
But what if I could make them work for you?

226
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,680
Your sinister tone intrigues me.

227
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,780
All-you-can-drink beers on me!

228
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,780
But paid for by Moe.

229
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:25,440
All right, I'm not even gonna dignify that with a "Whaaa?"

230
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,790
Do the thing, boy.

231
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,540
No, no, don't ruin it, kid!

232
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,210
I'm taking my girlfriend to that movie

233
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:34,200
when it gets to the two-dollar theater.

234
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,670
What time did you get home last night?

235
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,600
it's not my fault.

236
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,170
Bart used his superpower to get me drunker than I've ever beer.

237
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,770
I'm worried that all this blackmail

238
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,470
is turning Bart into a bad person.

239
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,410
What's the story, morning glories?

240
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,750
Young man, I don't like the way you're using those spoilies

241
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,940
to boss people around.

242
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,830
What? I was given an amazing power,

243
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,130
so I'm using it.

244
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,300
If you were in my suitcase, you would do the same thing.

245
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,720
Fans have a deep connection to the Marble Cinematic Universe.

246
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,660
I would never exploit that, not for anything.

247
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,880
Wouldn't you?

249
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,240
Lisa Simpson, I think your superpower

250
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,220
must be stealing hearts.

251
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,640
How do you feel about exploitation now?

252
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,190
It's okay.

253
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
How much longer do I have to keep up

254
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,130
this kookaburra charade?

255
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,750
How badly do you not want your bosses at Marble Studios

256
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,530
to know that I used your drunken thumb to see that movie?

257
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:05,180
You think I'm your jolly swagman, do you?

259
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,850
Well, my jumbuck's gonna be free

261
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,890
from your tucker bag next Thursday,

262
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:12,940
when that movie goes wide on every screen in creation.

263
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,880
And after that, you're nothing.

264
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,550
Let's get this party finished!

265
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,530
He's right.

266
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,700
I'm running out of time.

267
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,770
This is... endgame!

269
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,540
And so, today, we celebrate the 200th birthday

270
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,500
of our beloved oak tree, Old Susie.

271
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,840
Her stately branches have shaded our town's weddings,

272
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:41,530
family reunions, and quincen-- quincien--

275
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,260
Mexican bar mitzvahs.

276
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,700
We're, uh, ow!

277
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,810
Cover you ears! It's Spoiler Boy!

278
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,390
That's right. It's me.

279
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,350
And if you don't want the movie spoiled,

280
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,400
you'll all pull together and build me

281
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,650
the ultimate tree house of my own design.

282
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:01,180
Right here in Old Susie.

283
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,240
Not in Old Susie!

284
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,160
Everyone in this town loves that tree!

285
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,990
We have no choice.

286
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:12,200
He's got us all by the short and curlies.

287
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:16,780
Unless the boy should meet with an unfortunate accident.

288
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,920
And if anything suspicious should happen to me,

289
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,420
I've hired the loudest man in town to yell the ending

290
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,340
on every street corner.

291
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,050
I'm on it!

293
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,890
You have 24 hours to build my tree house.

294
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,370
The clock is ticking.

295
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,190
Hey, buddy. You're out of the hospital.

296
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,150
Don't you "Hey, buddy" me.

297
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,650
You stole my visit from Airshot.

298
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,490
You-- you villain!

299
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,120
Me, a villain? No way.

300
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,160
You just blackmailed the whole town to build you a lair.

301
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,710
Okay. I will grant you the optics on the lair

302
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,080
are less than ideal.

303
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,960
You have actual powers which you use for evil.

304
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,300
You're a supervillain!

305
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,260
You dare call me a supervillain?

306
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,800
Then get a load of this:

307
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,580
the biggest spoiler in the whole movie!

308
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,100
Magnesium Man!

309
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,390
Don't say another word!

310
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,460
The fate of our universe depends on it.

311
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,570
Where the hell am I?

312
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,160
Relax there, Spoiler Boy.

313
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,740
All we did was take you from your dimension into ours.

314
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,830
You know, the Marble universe?

315
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:37,290
What you consider to be movies make up our reality.

316
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,000
No way. Superheroes aren't real.

317
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,280
How dumb do you think I am?

318
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,300
Actual superpowers!

319
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,630
Everything you see in your Vindicator movies

320
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,450
actually happens to us.

321
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,160
Even the post-credit sequences?

322
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:57,540
We brought you here to see the result of your selfish actions.

323
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,230
Airshot! Dead?

324
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,690
But in the movie he lives.

325
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,320
Wh-what happened?

326
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,650
You happened!

327
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,780
You son of a swamp witch!

328
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:11,820
You showed your Comic Book Guy a spoiler

329
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,080
of Airshot using his breath to save himself.

330
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,410
The powers of evil in our dimension

331
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:21,780
saw this and, so warned, taped Airshot's mouth shut.

332
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,030
And killed him.

333
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,170
I didn't know!

334
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:28,130
I never dreamed that spoilers really hurt people.

335
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:31,660
But they do. Spoilers kill!

336
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,790
I love you, Airshot!

337
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,180
The virtual reality's working.

338
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,520
The kid has no idea that this has all been fake.

339
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,980
I can't believe he didn't notice

340
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,360
that the dimensional portal in his backyard

341
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,180
was just a garbage bag full of glow sticks.

342
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,490
Tell me we're doing the right thing.

344
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,660
Tell me this is Bart's best chance

345
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,660
to choose to be a good person.

346
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,950
Don't worry, Marge.

347
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,950
No one's ever been hurt by a little gaslighting.

348
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,860
Remember how you always say that?

349
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,270
Remember?

350
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,040
Oh, don't think of it as gaslighting.

351
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,050
Think of it as an ultra-enhanced,

352
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,800
immersive fan experience.

353
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,300
All this, just to keep spoilers from leaking.

354
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,680
Vindicators, colon, Crystal War, colon, Resurgence

355
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,140
bombing at the box office

356
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,350
would have devastating consequences.

357
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,140
Failing theme parks, unsold Halloween costumes

359
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,400
rotting on the docks,

360
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,770
mass suicides by popcorn farmers;

361
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,780
anything worse than a 55% hold

362
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,280
on its second weekend,

363
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,780
the global economy collapses like a house of cards.

364
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,280
Is that what you want, little girl? Is it?

365
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,580
No. No.

366
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,790
Bart clearly feels bad.

367
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,450
Can't we let him out now?

368
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,210
No. We have to be absolutely sure.

369
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,780
Increasing simulation intensity.

370
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,620
Bring me the boy.

371
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,010
Remember, kid, no spoilers!

372
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,730
Our universe depends on it!

373
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:05,880
And don't pirate movies. That hurts everyone.

374
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,530
So, the boy who's seen how all this ends.

375
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,650
Tell me what you know,

376
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,610
so I can use it to destroy the Vindicators.

377
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:18,580
In return, I will grant your deepest desire:

378
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,230
actual superpowers.

379
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:22,810
Muscles...

380
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,440
claws...

381
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,520
bike!

382
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,380
Real powers.

383
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,070
That's even better than spoiler powers.

384
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,510
Oh, no. Our son is going to choose evil.

385
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:39,120
Oh, no! Our son is so stupid he's going to fall for this!

386
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,430
It doesn't matter that's it not real.

387
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,680
Bart's soul is at stake.

388
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,130
Great emotion. Talk about upping the ante.

389
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,770
Tell me the spoilers, child.

390
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,140
And embrace your destiny as a villain.

391
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,220
Airshot.

392
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,660
All right. I'll tell you what you have to do to win.

393
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,870
- No! - Uh-uh, kid.

394
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,980
Eat my shorts.

395
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,400
No. No.

396
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,690
No...!

397
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,090
Our son's a good guy! A good guy.

398
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,850
But he's still stupid. So stupid...

399
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,230
The kid turned down actual superpowers.

400
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,920
I think he'll keep his mouth shut.

401
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,210
Okay. We'll let him live.

402
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:31,840
For now.

403
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,570
I'm back.

404
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,390
I just hope it's not too late.

405
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,950
What day is it?

406
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:45,200
Why, it's the Wednesday before Memorial Day, it is.

407
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,330
Then there's still time.

408
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,830
The movie hasn't been spoiled.

409
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,750
Don't worry, son.

410
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,650
Your secret I forgot is safe with me.

411
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,000
I saved their universe. I'm not a villain.

412
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,660
I'm a superhero.

413
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,790
- When can we tell him? - Never.

414
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:02,640
All right. No one's gonna talk.

415
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,890
The movie's safe.

416
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:06,580
We'll let them live. For now.

420
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,490
I'm not a bad guy.

421
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,490
I'm a good guy.

422
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,150
I'll never spoil anything again.

423
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:31,980
I'm a changed boy. A changed boy.

425
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,540
I always knew you had the stuff of heroes.

426
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,750
Just tell me, does Moby Man take his place

427
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,660
as the rightful sovereign of Fishtonia?

428
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:42,620
Does he? Bart! Tell me!

429
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,350
Stop your labors, good folk.

430
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:47,790
Magnesium Man bless us, every one.

431
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,190
And Bart was as good as his word.

432
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,100
He kept his mouth shut.

434
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:56,650
So when everyone finally saw the movie on opening day,

435
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,940
they were filled with joy.

436
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,030
Then immediately got on their phones

437
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:04,020
and spoiled it for everyone else.
