We can't leave!

397
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,930
专家说电子产品比海洛因更难戒掉
Studies show tech is more addictive than heroin.

398
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,490
百度和抖音上已经辟谣了
Google and TikTok say that's a lie.

399
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,190
我们需要治疗
We have to be cured.

每个家庭都存在着无法回避的难题
families have faced the problem of

staying together without driving each other crazy.

405

406
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:02,300
人们在家拉小提琴  后来爆发了内战
they played fiddle music until they had a war.

407
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,620
从此某优秀的体制消亡了
It was a good system.

408
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,120
后来人们开始围在火炉旁收听电台
Then, they came up with sitting around a radio.

409
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,260
但由于没有屏幕
But without a screen,

410
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,380
还得时不时地看见家人的脸
they still had time to look at each other..

411
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,170
所以爆发了...二战
So... World War II.

412
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,940
直到发明了电视
With peace came TV,

413

给硅谷精英们争取了时间来发明出
which bought Silicon Valley the time to invent the devices

414
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,180
可以让我们完全孤立的电子产品
that isolate us completely.

415
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,810
也正因为如此  美国人民
Finally, the American family was safe...

416
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,020
终于安全了
from itself.

417

你说的有一句是真的吗
Is any of that true?

418
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,990

423
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,790
我还以为这里不许用电子产品
I thought this was a screen-free environment.

425
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,710
病人们是不允许的
It is, for the patients.

You stole her password when she checked in!

431

和其他康复中心不一样  你这是黑店
Unlike every other rehab, this one is a scam!

432
