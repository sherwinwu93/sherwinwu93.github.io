听人讲话的时候嘴巴会惊讶地张开

161
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,950
他在推特上被很多名人都拉黑了
He's been blocked by so many celebrities on Twitter.

162
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,760
他还认为我是整个核电站里

163

最有价值的员工

他蠢到家了
He's super dumb.

166

没有咖啡  只有甜甜圈球

传说中的7G区
Sector 7G.

180
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:36,640
7G  一个连奥林匹斯诸神都不敢涉足的地方

你的知识堪比五级飓风

与你相比  我就像是井底之蛙
and I'm like that old idiot who won't leave his beach house.

184
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,710
用你的知识把我淹没在我的小阁楼里吧
Please, drown me in my attic with what you know.

185
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,150

所以我准备了鸡汤海报
So I've prepared inspirational posters.

00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,180
我简直不敢相信
I can't believe this.

201
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,040
我才35岁  我就坐在了
I-I'm only 35 and I am sitting at the feet

202
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,980
原子版巴巴布伊面前[形容领域大咖]
of the atomic Baba Booey.

203
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,650
你35岁了
You're 35?

204
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,490
那你为什么干着二十岁的人做的工作
Then why do you have a job of a 20-year-old

205
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,060
说话像个十岁的孩子
and talk like a ten-year-old?

206
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:26,980
是这样的
Here's how it is.

207
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,400
我和我兄弟内斯托
So, my buddy 'Nesto and me

208
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,930
我们清理排水管挣钱
were cleaning gutters for cash,

209
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,250
然后那个废物掉下来了
when that idiot 'Nesto falls off

210
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,240
掉在了狗窝上  愚蠢的内斯托
and lands on a doghouse. Stupid 'Nesto.

211
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,760
然后我父母就开始专心帮我寻找职业方向了
Then my parents are on my case to get a real career,

212
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,520
一些更实际的东西[离地面更近]
something "closer to the ground."

213
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,600
我就想  为什么不追随着我的英雄
So I thought, "Why not follow my hero

214
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,320
从事人类最伟大的行业
"into man's greatest calling?

215
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,910
核能什么的
Nuclear whatever."

216
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,970
所以我到核电站去
So I went down to the plant,

217
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,920
跟他们说我算是土著人
told them I was part Native American--

218
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,890
我有可能是  我一直都像他们一样
I could be, I always liked those guys--

219
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,970
然后  我就变成实习生了
and boom! I'm an intern.

220
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,870
短短三年之后  我就有导师了
Three short years later, got myself a mentor.

221
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,760
我的海报真的起作用了了
Wow. My posters really worked.

222
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,830
但是根本不用我来告诉你你有多优秀
But you don't need me telling you how great you are,

223
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,640
你在家里听的就够多的了
y-you get enough of that at home.

我希望你请学生来家里吃饭之前

237
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,320
能早点告诉我
before inviting a mentee for dinner.

238
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,580
要是在砂锅菜上多加一倍薯片
I guess we'll have enough

239
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,460
我们应该够吃
if I double the chip layer on the casserole.

240

00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,290
他是唯一尊敬我的人
He's the only one that respects me!

306
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,520
孩子和我都尊敬你
The kids and I respect you.

307
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,580
你们只是在爱我
All you guys ever did was love me.

308
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,990
但看着我的眼睛说你尊敬我
But look me in the eyes and tell me you respect me,

309
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,680
作为一个核能系统的职工
as a nuclear guy.

310
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,990
我只是喜欢那种感觉
I just liked the feeling

311
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,780
有人能认真赞赏我的能力
that one person thinks I'm good at something.

312
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,740
我懂了  侯默
Mm, I get it, Homie.

313
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,060
但如果你真想帮一个人
But if you really want to help this guy,

314
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,610
要帮他成长
help him grow up.

315
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,750
拜托  福德姆
Come on, Fordham,

316
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,180
巴克内尔防守没跟上
Bucknell's got no rim protection.

317
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,560
他们太垃圾了  别输4分以上啊
They're garbage. Just cover the spread.

318
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,450
侯默  你好吗
Hey, Homer. How's it clangin'?

319
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,850
我在听大学篮球赛赛况
I'm, uh, just tunin' in to a little college hoops.

320
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,400
迈克  我在想
Yeah, Mike, I was thinking,

321
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:15,200
假设你不是一个三十五岁的
if you weren't a 35-year-old unpaid intern

322
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,850
无薪实习生加准爸爸  你有其他梦想吗
with a baby on the way, do you have any other dreams?

323
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,520
您现在正在深入指导我
Ah, man, you are mentoring me hard right now.

324
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,990
好  我会说的  但你别笑
Oh, okay, I'm gonna tell you, but don't laugh.

325
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,090
我不会的
I won't.

326
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,450
披萨片
Slices.

327
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,050
吃片披萨是最幸福的事了  对吗
Nothing better than getting a slice of pizza, right?

328
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,850
但披萨总会被食品保温加热灯烤干
But it's always been under the heat lamp all dried out.

329
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,750
该死的加热灯
Damn heat lamp.

330
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,640
那为什么不索性把披萨做成单块
Right. So why not make the pizza one slice at a time,

331
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,640
保证热度和新鲜度
hot and fresh?

332
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,200
每块披萨都是德瑞克·基特
Every slice is Derek Jeter.

333
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,200
{\an8}美国职棒大联盟的选手

334
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,550
没有一块是斯科特·布罗修斯
No Scott Brosius in the bunch.

335
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,870
天才啊
That's genius!

336
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,620
天呐  你竟然喜欢这主意
Oh, my God, I can't believe you like it.

337
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,830
迈克  知道你该为这个起什么名吗
Mike! You know what you should call your slices?

338
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,290
迈克家披萨片
Mike's Slices.

339
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,380
我叫迈克
I'm Mike!

340
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,030
没错  你需要的是一个投资人
Yeah! Okay, what you need is an investor,

341
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,550
我有个完美人选
and I know the perfect person.

342
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,250
他给了我五块钱
He gave me five dollars.

343
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:05,120
{\an8}迈克家披萨片

344
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,420
每块都是新鲜出炉
Every slice hot and fresh

345
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,640
从烤箱直达嘴巴
from the oven into your mouth.

346
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,530
每块都是基特
Every slice a Jeter.

347
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:10,360
而非斯科特·布罗修斯
No Scott Brosiuses.

348
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,180
我为什么不点个披萨饼自己分
Why can't I get a whole pizza and slice it myself?

349
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,670
根本没有披萨饼这一说
There are no whole pizzas.

350
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,920
{\an8}迈克家披萨片

351
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:17,600
只有片的  新鲜出炉
It's just slices, hot and fresh.

352
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,230
别担心您的投资  伯恩斯先生
And don't worry about investing with this guy, Mr. Burns,

353
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,940
因为我  侯默·杰·辛普森
because he's backed by the full mentorship

354
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,260
是他的全职导师
of Homer J. Simpsons.

355
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,620
我很荣幸的告诉你们
Then it's my pleasure to tell you...

356
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,330
这是我听过的最蠢的点子
that that is the stupidest idea I've ever heard.

357
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,740
把这实习生带出去吧  你个傻子
Get this intern out of my office, you nincompoop!

358
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:41,790
没有人可以不尊敬侯默·杰·辛普森
Ho! No one disrespects Homer J. Simpsons.

359
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,100
迈克  别这样
No, Mike, don't.

360
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:43,930
傻
Nin...

361
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,380
子
com... poop!

362
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,140
听着  你这个脑满善存银片的混账
Listen to me, you skunk-bag full of Centrum Silver

363
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,790
把装满花生碎的大屁股往那里一坐
sitting on your peanut brittle ass

364
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,790
长着一张跨世纪的秃鹰丑脸
with your turn-of-the-century buzzard face.

365
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,610
根本不配戳这人的脊梁骨
You ain't worthy to squeegee this man's back sweat.

366
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:56,660
你身上的味道好像被人丢在空心南瓜灯里的
You smell like Chinese food that someone left

367
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,040
中餐的味道
in an old jack-o'-lantern.

368
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,440
我的导师是整个扎莱斯最闪亮的那颗钻石
My mentor is the shiniest diamond in the whole Zales,

369
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,090
所以把你的这些器官塞回福尔马林里去
so stuff your organs back in their jars

370
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,030
趴回你老母亲的子宫里
and crawl in your mummy box,

371
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,000
你这个病态的  长满霉菌的  丙型肝炎吸血鬼
you sick, fungused-up, hep-C Dracula!

372
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:14,260
对了  他已经停了快乐药片了
By the way, he's off his happy pills.

373
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,940
你很幸运  伯恩斯先生的枪已经200岁了
You're lucky Mr. Burns gun was 200 years old.

374
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,180
没错  但现在我的医生说
Yeah, but now my doctor says

375
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,240
我的脸不能再承受一击了
I can't get shot in the face again.

376
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,400
现在谁最丑啊  小脑袋
Who's ugly now, pellet-head?

377
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,450
好了  没事  别哭
Come on, it's okay. Don't cry.

378
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,290
我没哭  这些BB弹害我脑袋很沉重
I'm not. All the BBs in my head are making it heavy.

379
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:36,080
迈克  都是我的错
Mike, this is all my fault.

380
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,850
我知道你觉得我是个很棒的核能人  但我不是
I know you think I'm a great nuclear guy, but I'm not.

381
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,780
不是我阻止了这些事故
I didn't stop those accidents.

382
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,110
这都是我引起的
I caused them.

383
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,880
什么  不是
Huh? No. No.

384
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,150
我所有的海报  "赌上你自己"
All my posters-- "Bet on Yourself,"

385
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,710
"要么做大  要么回家"
"Go Big or Go Home"--

386
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,950
是我在海报店偷东西被抓住了
I was caught shoplifting those from a poster store.

387
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,040
我是想做大事  但做完他们不让我回家
I was trying to go big, and they wouldn't let me go home.

388
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:57,660
迈克  面对事实吧  我是个糟糕的导师
Mike, face it, I'm a bad mentor.

389
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,760
没有人可以不尊敬侯默·杰·辛普森
No one disrespects Homer Simpsons.

390
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,630
你也不行
Not even you.

391
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,580
像我这样睡别人新娘的混蛋  你这样的导师
You're the best mentor a lousy bride-banger like me

392
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,520
是我力所能及范围内最好的
could ever ask for.

393
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,960
而且我要证实这个观点
And I'm gonna prove it.

394
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,620
谁把BB弹撒的到处都是
Who spilled BBs all over the... whoa!

395
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,850
导师
Yo! Mentor!

396
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:22,120
{\an8}迈克家披萨片

397
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,910
你们谁想吃一片不是从披萨上
Anybody want a slice of pizza

398
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:26,190
切下来的披萨片
that wasn't sliced from a pizza?

399
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,840
你这个流动餐车哪里来的
Where'd you get a food truck?

400
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:31,150
都是因为你  导师  因为你  接受吧
It's all cause of you, mentor, all cause of you. Deal with it.

401
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:33,470
我跟孩子们要一份披萨饼
The boys and I will take a large pie.

402
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,250
你不识字吗  小老头
Can't you read a truck, Cookie Puss?

403
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,430
只有披萨片
Slices only!

404
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,400
好嘞  请给我三片  谢谢
All righty, three slices, please.

405
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:42,260
会在13  26  39分钟后好
They'll be ready in 13, 26 and 39 minutes.

406
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,270
别挡住窗户  老家伙
And don't block the window, sizzle chest.

407
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,910
我的那片什么时候能好
When will my slice be ready?

408
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:49,820
我说的这个片  是指你未偿贷款的
And by "Slice," I mean the first payment

409
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,310
第一笔还款
on your outstanding loan.

410
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:55,000
你从黑帮那里借钱
You borrowed money from the mob?!

411
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,840
不不不不不不  没事的
No, no, no, no, no, no. It's all good.

412
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,580
我从胖东尼那里借了10万美元  为期一周
I took a one-week loan from Fat Tony for a hundred grand.

413
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,460
我把5万买了流动餐车
I put $50k into the truck

414
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,010
然后把剩下的5万押在了今晚的里海比赛上
and then bet the other 50 on tonight's Lehigh game,

415
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,050
很保险的
which is a lock.

416
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,290
等我赢了赌注  我会把钱还给黑帮
So when I win the bet, I pay back the mob,

417
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,700
然后就能免费获得这辆流动餐车了
and I own the truck free and clear.

418
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,020
不是吧
Oh, no.

419
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,400
你赌上的是你自己
You bet on yourself!

420
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,340
{\an8}披萨片

421
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,340
要么做大  要么回家  老铁
Go big or go home, baby.

422
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,480
里海队有麻烦了
And Lehigh's in trouble

423
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,580
因为圣十字队快攻拿下无人防守的20分
as Holy Cross goes on an unanswered 20-point run.

424
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,370
不不不  里海很保险的
No, no, no, Lehigh is a lock!

425
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:27,160
在冰球场上他们从未败过的
They're undefeated on floors with hockey ice beneath them.

426
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,270
因为一场爱国者联盟篮球赛
Yet again, a man's life hangs by the gossamer thread

427
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,600
又一个人再次命悬一线
of Patriot League basketball.

428
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,310
举起枪来
Guns up.

429
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,370
但是里海靠一个远距离投三分球
But Lehigh takes the lead with a three

430
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,340
暂时领先三分
from way behind the arc.

431
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,820
-太棒了  -放下枪
- Yes! - Guns down.

432
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,660
但是十字军们用关键
But the Crusaders answer

433
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,140
一记篮筐球挽回颓势
with a floater in the key!

434
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,770
里海回应了一记野兽般的暴扣
And Lehigh comes back with a monster dunk!

435
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:50,620
太棒了
Yeah!

436
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,250
随着比赛最后一秒的结束  里海又投入一球
As the final seconds tick away, Lehigh has this one in the bag!

437
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,750
但也死挺了
The body bag!

438
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,480
虽然经历了最后一秒的起伏
As a last-second half-court heave

439
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,590
十字军队获得了胜利
gives Holy Cross the win.

440
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,210
举起枪来
Guns up.

441
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,330
打开保险
Safeties off.

442
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,490
别担心  我知道一个地方
Don't worry, I know a place

443
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,030
他们绝对找不到我们
where they will never find us.

444
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,230
{\an8}废弃场
海上救助  咆哮的狗  废料堆

445
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,540
快餐车废弃场
A food truck graveyard.

446
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,230
{\an8}浪费的愤怒

447
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,230
为什么有这么多失败的品牌
Why are there so many failed ones?

448
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,770
因为他们像我一样没有原创
'Cause they don't have an original concept, like me.

449
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,710
侯默  我得跟你坦白一件事情
Homer, I got to tell you one thing.

450
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,220
你的孩子不丑
Your boy's not ugly.

451
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,200
他很漂亮
He's gorgeous.

452
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,700
像他爸爸那样
Just like his old man.

453
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,190
他会好起来的
He's gonna clean up.

454
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:58,300
告诉帕特里珂我爱她
Tell baby Patrick I loved her.

455
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,830
好了  干死我吧
All right, do me.

456
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,220
我闻到了马苏里拉奶酪
I smell mozzarella

457
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:08,910
慢慢在一块三角形的面团上融化的味道
gently melting over a single slice of triangular dough.

458
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,000
在了解之前  我们共享一个披萨饼
Before the end, we will share a pie.

459
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,480
只卖披萨片  你这个穴居人
It's just slices, you goombah caveman!

460
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,110
一般如果在加热灯下面
Mmm! Usually a slice is dried out

461
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:22,200
披萨会干掉  但这片却热乎乎新鲜极了
from sitting under a heat lamp, but this is hot and fresh!

462
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,320
看到了吗  这个人有很多好点子
See? This guy has good ideas.

463
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,920
如果...
What if...

464
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:29,560
你让迈克在流动餐车上工作还钱呢
you let Mike work in the truck to pay you back?

465
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,460
不行  流动餐车的生意太冒险了
No. The food truck business is too big a gamble.

466
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,520
随着合法网上赌博的出现
And even our gambling operation is in trouble

467
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,770
我们的赌博项目运行也有了麻烦
with the advent of legal online wagering.

468
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,280
真糟糕  你奈何不了我的流动餐车
Too bad you can't take action out of my food truck,

469
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,860
那么由你来下赌注吧
let the betting come to you.

470
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,630
现在  杀了我吧
Now, do me already!

471
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,710
一个可以赌博的流动餐车
A food truck that takes bets?

472
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,380
我要一片加奶酪
I'll take a slice of cheese

473
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,620
和赌乔治城的moneyline
and the moneyline on Georgetown.

474
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:58,040
东尼  我们的德育博彩非常火
Yo, Tony! We're raking it in on the sportsbook.

475
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,230
而且同时卖大麻也是个好选择
And it was a great idea to sell weed out of this thing also.

476
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,640
侯默  你相信了这个家伙
Homer, you believed in this stagelagoots

477
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,230
在别人不看好他时坚持己见
when no one else would.

478
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,570
倾听他的想法
You listened to him,

479
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,120
培养他的观点
nurtured his ideas,

480
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,300
现在他成功了
and now he is a success.

481
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:18,230
你真是个很棒的导师
Truly, you're a excellent mentor.
