23
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,160
And that's why, if you go to that little town in France,

25
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,950
there's a statue of me surrendering.

27
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,320
See?

28
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,450
Wow, Grampa, your stories are really cool today.

29
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,890
Yeah, the nursing home finally stopped using me as the placebo

30
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,650
and gave me real meds.

31
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,270
But what I really wanted to do today was to give you this,

33
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,530
my most precious possession.

34
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,530
Open it.

35
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,390
It'll explode in just five seconds if you pull the pin.

36
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,980
Uh-oh. Senior moment!

37
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,500
Put it back! Put it back!

38
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,430
It don't work that way! It's like having a kid!

39
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,150
- Say your prayers, boy. - Never!

40
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,100
Ha, ha! I pranked ya.

41
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,560
Grampa, that was hilarious.

42
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,890
I understand if the answer's no,

43
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,680
but can I borrow your dud grenade?

44
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,620
Aw, he's asleep.

45
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,110
That means yes.

47
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,190
This year, we've just been named the most sedentary school

49
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,040
- in the state. - Yay!

51
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,550
Yay!

52
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,100
No. No, no. Sedentary is a bad thing.

54
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,310
Our vocabulary score was also abysmal.

55
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,380
- Is that a bad... - It's a bad thing, yes.

56
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,590
- Yay! - Now to get you kids

57
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,140
up on your feet, we decided to have

58
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,420
a two-hour-long sit-down assembly instead of recess.

59
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,590
No fair!

60
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,180
- Sit down. - Yes... ma'am.

61
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,400
To kick things off, please welcome the new mascot

62
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,310
from the town's semi-amateur hockey team, Vinnie the Vulture.

63
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,250
Hey, kids.

64
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,620
Milhouse, you didn't tell me your dad got another bad job.

65
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,800
Actually, he's the understudy.

66
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,840
The main guy got shingles.

67
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,290
Ugh, there's a bee in my beak!

68
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,090
Okay, taking a break. Ow!

69
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,850
How many-- ow! How many stingers can one be have?!

70
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,070
How about a little show-and-tell?

71
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,280
I'll go first!

72
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,060
Don't worry.

73
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,360
It is a live grenade,

74
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,740
but it won't go off as long as you don't pull the pin out.

75
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,860
Caramba!

76
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,290
Climb in my ass hatch, son.

77
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,870
It was all just a joke.

78
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,890
You monster. You had me finally believing

79
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,840
the school would be destroyed, and you took it away.

80
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,900
I didn't think it was funny either, Bart.

81
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,620
You have no idea how far up in there I went.

82
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,820
Mom, you heard there was an emergency and you came?

83
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,240
Oh, well, actually, I was just having a sleepover

84
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,120
with your uncle... moustache over there.

85
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:46,470
Mom,

86
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,190
you promised you'd never show up at school drunk again.

87
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,510
I'm not gonna lie, I am in a shame spiral,

88
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:55,490
hanging out with lowlifes and bums.

89
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,480
Hey, Gary.

90
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,000
This is to not say my name.

91
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,370
Payday!

92
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,710
Nelson, I'm gonna go take a nap in your locker.

93
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,360
Freedom!

94
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,300
Son, you forced this man to jump on the grenade

95
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,210
seconds before I was going to.

96
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,690
Well, Simpson, thanks to you,

97
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,200
now no one can bring grenades to school.

98
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,740
This time, you will be expelled, never to return.

99
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,710
Please don't expel him.

100
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,970
He's got nowhere to go.

101
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,670
Bart Simpson, I hereby declare you...

102
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,350
Wait. I've lived next to this boy for years.

103
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,430
There's good in him. Let me work with him after school.

104
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,180
I'll improve him with the three P's:

105
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,100
persistence, prayer and persistent prayer.

106
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,900
Oh, God, you're one of those.

107
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,430
- Dear Lord... - Don't kneel. Don't kneel!

108
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,930
We're in a public school, for God's sake!

110
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,320
"Engel v. Vitale, 1962.

111
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,260
The Supreme Court asserts that..."

112
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,270
Superintendent,

113
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,680
you are about to be on the business end of a prayer chain.

114
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,580
"As a part of a religious program carried on by government,

116
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,070
it is a matter of history..."

117
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,370
My love of prayer is reflected in my chest hair.

118
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,440
I appear to be in the wrong group chat.

119
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,860
"and the judgment of the Court of Appeals of New York is reversed,

120
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,940
and the cause of..."

121
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,940
Amen.

122
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,900
Sir, we're up to 205 verified pray-ers.

125
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,260
Do you really want me to give them your office number?

127
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,690
Hmm? Hmm?

130
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,320
Fine. Stop, please! I've had enough.

131
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,930
We won't expel Bart.

132
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,500
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

133
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,490
If you supervise this boy,

134
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,850
keeping him away from the baleful presence of his father.

135
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,490
Woo-hoo! Win-win!

136
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,200
Bon après-midi, Bart.

137
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,660
While you get some special help,

138
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,500
I'm hanging with the French club.

139
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,370
Well, just don't make fun of me in French.

140
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,940
Vous êtes un imbécile.

141
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:47,260
Profitez de votre journée avec le Flanders!

142
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,160
A demain.

143
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,660
Ah, nous allons faire un pique-nique.

144
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,950
Oh! Shut up. Shut up!

145
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,300
Vous ne parlez pas français?

146
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,360
Isn't it great, son?

147
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,370
Washing dishes can be both a chore and a meditation.

148
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,330
I do feel kind of at peace.

149
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,730
Uh-oh. Cut myself.

150
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,400
Oh, my God, oh, my God!

151
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,420
Gotcha!

152
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,010
I can make that real blood, you little punk.

153
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,250
What did you say?

154
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:20,810
What I meant to say was,

155
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,340
oodily-doodily, we'll change that atti-toodily.

156
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,450
Fishing?

158
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,790
When I didn't take a Ritalin?

159
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,510
- You monster. - Hush.

160
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,830
If you don't catch something, we don't eat tonight.

161
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,010
Stupid fishing.

162
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,820
Stupid peace and quiet.

163
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,350
Stupid sunset.

164
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,890
Thinks it has so many colors.

165
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,500
So beautiful and bright and golden and...

166
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,980
Mind your line, Bart. You got a nibble.

167
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,250
I've got it! I've got it!

168
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,890
I murdered a fish. Me, by myself.

169
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:48,980
Don't get cocky, son.

170
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,090
You've still got to clean it and eat it.

171
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,490
First things first, we got to start a fire.

172
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,270
Uh, with what?

173
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,070
We'll build character by building it ourselves.

174
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,720
Your turn.

175
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,790
Oh, my hands hurt.

176
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,490
There are child labor laws, you know.

177
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,320
This is the most idiotic...

178
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,630
- How do you feel? - Great. But why?

179
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,290
Well, it's called "Accomplishment", Son--

180
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,710
something you've earned yourself

181
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,560
that can never be taken from you.

182
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,910
Left-handed handshake.

183
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,290
And now that you're on your way,

184
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,130
there's no telling how far you'll go.

185
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:34,920
*Amazing grace*

186
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,140
*How sweet the sound... *

187
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,080
Oh, my goodness.

188
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,440
Our little boy could never sing like that before.

189
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,450
Well, if you ask me, he's not doing so well now.

190
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,180
Mm. Remarkable.

191
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,260
I thought the only way to turn Bart into a little angel

192
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,400
was a downed power line at a water park.

193
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,670
Ah, you must be so proud.

194
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,750
You really turned that boy around.

195
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,070
Oh. Well...

196
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,540
Congratulations,

197
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,970
Ned Flanders.

198
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,790
Yeah. Way to go there, Flanders.

199
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,310
You the man, Ned.

200
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:10,290
Hey, you can't give him all the credit.

201
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,100
We're the ones who messed him up in the first place.

202
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,800
Uh, listen, stupid Flanders,

203
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,710
I just want to say thank you,

204
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,910
and if there's anything I can do for you...

205
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,560
Well, for starters, you could stop calling me

206
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,550
"Stupid Flanders."

207
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,550
Oh, here we go.

208
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,490
No, that's it.

209
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,440
Thank you, Flanders.

210
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,910
Was that so hard?

211
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:40,280
He was laughing under that mustache.

212
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,530
What are you doing here?

213
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,460
Bart's actually doing math homework.

214
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,540
I wanted to see it for myself.

215
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,490
Bup-up-up-up!

216
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,540
Listen, I can help my own kid.

217
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,210
Uh, let's see.

218
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,030
Four and two-thirds plus five-sixths equals,

219
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,820
uh, uh, carry the math...

220
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,920
And, uh...

221
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,860
Oh, no! The dog ate it!

222
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,950
It's okay, Dad. I finished it.

223
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,670
With Mr. Flanders' help.

224
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,910
Well, it looks like I'm useless.

225
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:16,910
Let me just walk away with my dignity.

227
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,660
*Who can I turn to*

229
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,990
*When nobody needs me*

230
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,960
My son doesn't love me.

233
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,670
You don't get me at all.

235
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,050
Hey, kid. I'm sad, too.

236
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,440
You shouldn't be out here alone.

237
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,340
Oh, nobody cares.

238
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,690
My dad left.

239
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,420
My mom's a drunk.

240
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,090
My house is a trailer, and all the wheels are flat.

241
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,080
My last solid food was an ice cube.

242
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,880
My TV is a milk crate with a squirrel in it.

243
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,900
This kid is such a wreck,

244
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,190
even I could help him.

245
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,790
Which I could use to get back at Bart.

246
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,890
I get my hair cut by hiding in the bushes

247
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,230
when the gardener comes by.

248
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:27,870
Am I gonna do it?

249
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,560
Is it wrong to take advantage of one child's feelings

250
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,020
to make another child feel bad?

251
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,310
Nobody has the answer to that.

252
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,520
Here, son. Let me help.

253
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,380
Okay, okay. Enough snot.

254
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,590
Say, uh, listen, kid, how would you like a mentor?

255
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,850
What's a mentor?

256
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,720
A mentor is a special kind of teacher.

257
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,300
But you don't know nothing.

258
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,310
Hey, there's lots I can teach you.

259
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,300
How to steal filling from a pie.

260
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,360
How to get cookies without giving blood.

261
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,580
How to use spearmint gum as a deodorant.

262
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,080
And maybe I'll get someone to fix your teeth.

263
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,030
There's a doctor for your teeth?

264
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,780
Can you teach me how to do this maze?

265
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,030
Well, it'll be a project we can work on together.

266
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,060
Cool.

267
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,510
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm out of ketchup.

268
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,810
I'll give it back

269
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:32,300
when I'm done.

270
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,330
Hello, Bart.

271
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,300
Just wanted you to know I'm going to Nelson's house.

272
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,270
We're close. Super close.

273
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,830
First of all, Dad, you called me.

274
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,510
And second, are you mentoring Nelson

275
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,480
just to get back at Bart?

276
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,450
No! No way!

277
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,560
But if you happen to see Bart, show him these.

279
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,280
Okay, kid, I'm gonna teach you how to pack

280
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,240
for when your wife kicks you out of the house.

281
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,510
Are the clothes thrown out onto the front yard?

282
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:12,170
Well, let's say you have enough time to get a suitcase.

283
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,510
What's a suitcase?

284
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:16,170
Uh, all right, let's move on to something else.

285
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:20,040
Okay, but first I got to ask: Are you sleeping with my mom?!

286
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,640
No.

287
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,480
No one's ever said that!

288
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,930
That's what we're going for, boys.

289
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,790
I can't believe we're gonna be in the pride parade.

290
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,220
Christian pride.

291
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,190
Finally, Christians can openly show our faith.

292
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,490
We're sure! We're pure!

293
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,900
Get used to it!

294
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,650
Hey, Bart.

295
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,740
Look who I taught how to ride a bike.

296
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,880
Nelson already knew how to ride a bike.

297
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,030
Yeah, but he didn't know how to make cool motorcycle noises.

298
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,910
Uh, let me help you back on your hog.

299
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,280
Me and Nelson are so close, people are calling us "Homeson."

300
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,910
Homeson away!

301
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,170
Homeson!

302
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,980
Mom, are you seeing all this?

303
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,280
- Yes. - Are you gonna do anything?

304
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,260
- No. - Why not?

305
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,470
This is a complicated one.

306
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,470
Both boys are being helped.

307
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:31,310
What I'm trying to say is it's time to change Maggie.

308
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,470
Where are you, my little excuse?

309
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:37,790
Sorry!

310
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,490
Dad, what exactly are you teaching Nelson?

311
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,200
Banking.

312
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,480
Aiming for success.

313
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:57,570
And breaking into the music industry.

314
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,650
Here's $40.

315
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,260
That's a lot of money to me.

316
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,920
But I want you to get some therapy about what you're doing.

317
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,400
40 bucks' worth of therapy coming up.

318
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,160
From a licensed therapist.

319
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,710
Moe has a liquor license.

320
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:14,420
Yeah, let's not discuss that too much.

321
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,400
Take the money. Get some help.

322
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,970
Why are you doing this?

323
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,510
Dad, I have to be the voice of morality.

324
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,810
No, you don't.

325
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,190
Well, I like being the voice of morality.

326
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,950
And I like believing this role has not typecast me!

327
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,530
I can still do Shakespeare!

328
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,400
All that glitters is not delicious Duff Gold!

330
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,950
To pee or not to pee!

331
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,920
{\an8}To be or not to be, that's a question.

332
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,920
There is no question!

333
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,030
Oh, no!

334
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,350
Excuse me. Got to pee.

336
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,060
Doc, I see it all so clearly now.

337
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,820
I'm afraid of success because my father never had time for me.

338
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,390
- Which means... - Time's up.

339
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,570
- But two more minutes... - It's not a breakthrough.

340
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,540
Ah, now I feel worse than when I came in.

341
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,760
See you next month.

342
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:04,130
Okay. 40 bucks gets you ten minutes. Go!

343
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:07,140
I was mentoring another kid to make my son jealous,

344
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,940
and something weird happened.

345
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,410
I'm actually starting to like the little dingus.

346
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,460
Help me.

347
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,550
I am appalled!

348
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,600
You are ruining two boys' lives

349
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,240
for your own petty ego.

350
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,660
Let me tell you what a good therapist says.

351
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:24,040
A good therapist says, "Whatever you do is right"!

352
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,150
That's only if you're rich.

353
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,550
Mentor entering!

354
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,940
Hey, Homer, honey.

355
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,720
Come on, spend a minute with Mama.

356
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,270
Look, lady, I'm not interested in...

357
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,610
- What the...? - I know.

358
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,120
You're just spending time with my son

359
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,770
to make your son jealous.

360
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:47,910
Sooner or later, you're gonna leave him, like all the rest.

361
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,710
And it'll break his heart.

362
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,650
Hey, I'm not here to save the world.

363
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:05,890
I'm a mentor. I come in, I ment, then I go.

364
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,470
Tell that boy the truth.

365
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,330
Son, we need to talk.

366
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,950
No. No. I know where this goes.

367
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,800
It ends with you giving me a phone number

368
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,160
that starts with 555.

369
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,440
No! Wait!

370
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,910
What do you have to say?

371
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,860
I was only mentoring you

372
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,940
to punish my son for becoming a better boy.

373
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,270
- I knew it! - Where are you going?

374
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,490
I'm gonna get even. I can't make you stay,

375
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,200
but I can take it out on your kid.

376
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,760
Not Bart! I do love him!

381
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:09,010
We're Christians! We're proud!

382
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,070
But don't say it too loud.

383
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,060
Holding hands are holy hands.

384
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,140
Ew. Are you wearing lotion?

385
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,850
I'm very chappy.

391
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,480
Uh, welcome, er, uh, Christians.

392
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,510
God is pleased to thank our corporate sponsor,

393
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,250
C. Montgomery Burns.

394
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,230
Why won't you die?

395
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,950
Mr. Burns will take questions later.

396
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,430
Er, uh, thanks to this magnificent parade,

397
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:11,270
you right-wing ding-dongs will keep me in office forever.

399
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,710
And now, at the spectacular culmination of the parade,

401
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,660
when the final float has safely cleared the route,

402
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,710
a giant pair of praying hands

403
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,890
will swing from the sides of the street

405
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:27,240
and come together in holy union.

408
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,460
He's gonna crush Bart!

409
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,160
Where's Flanders now?

410
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,570
Right here. What do you need?

411
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,810
Get away from me!

414
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:58,930
No...!

415
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,490
Hi, Dad.

416
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:10,350
Son, you want to ride in the ambulance together?

417
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,570
Aw. That's always been our thing.

418
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,540
- Dad? - Yes, son?

419
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,690
Can I have a hit off your oxygen?

420
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,210
Of course.

421
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,850
I'm a great dad.

424
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:39,580
I'm sorry I was using you. You're a sweet kid.

425
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,050
One day we'll have a beer about this and laugh.

426
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,640
- Can it be tomorrow? - Sure.

427
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,400
But for today, I know a certain stupid someone

428
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,610
who might be a little better at this than me.

429
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:57,260
- What's the matter, son? - Ah, you wouldn't understand.

430
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,260
A rich church usher like you.

431
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,380
Hey, I got two troublemakers of my own.

432
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,500
Who told you boys you could clean up this dump?

433
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,510
No one.

434
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,500
I think I just might understand how you feel.

435
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,270
You lost a dad. I lost two Mrs. Flanderses.

436
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,630
Maybe my boys and I could take you to a ball game sometime.

437
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,630
- What do you say? - Papa!

438
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:16,270
Yay! We have a brother!

439
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:19,610
Mean foster brother.

440
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:26,980
God bless Rod and Todd and especially my wonderful mentor,

441
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,400
Mr. Flanders.

442
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,600
Amen.

443
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,230
Let me get fresh napkins for everyone.

444
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,470
Hey, how's it going?

445
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:37,960
Still can't believe you've renounced the way of the bully.

446
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,650
Eh, what can I say? People change.

447
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,380
Thaw-thaw!

448
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,100
Tell me again, why did I trade Flanders for you?

449
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,380
Because we can do this.
