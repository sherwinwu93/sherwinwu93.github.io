23
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,560
No couch, boys. I gave it to the poor.

24
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,090
Neddy? Neddy.

25
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,320
Oh, Maude, you've come back.

26
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,050
Completely clothed and untouchable.

27
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,260
This is the sexiest dream I've ever had.

28
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,350
Wait, Maudie.

29
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,690
Just one little kiss.

30
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,460
All tongue, no lips.

31
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,780
Just like Maude.

32
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,100
Daddy, why are you crying?

33
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,140
Oh, just watering the old lip lawn.

34
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,600
I had a dream about your mom.

35
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,090
Don't you ever dream about her?

36
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,420
Faster, Mommy, faster.

37
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,320
What's wrong, Todd?

38
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,200
I can never unsee that.

39
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,890
It's okay, son. Just a bad dream.

40
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,220
Want some lukewarm water?

41
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,960
Daddy, I can't remember what Mommy looks like.

42
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,300
I think I might have a video or two of your mother.

43
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,410
What's wrong?

44
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,510
I'm doing Mommy's old skin routine.

45
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,070
Now, that's the healthy way to grieve.

48
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,270
I'm scared.

49
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,460
Well, I have faith in you.

50
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,380
Who are you people,

51
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,130
and what have you done with my family?

52
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,180
Answer me!

53
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,070
Oh, Dad, every time we make you shovel the driveway,

54
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,420
you wind up someplace crazy.

55
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,210
Won't you join us for dinner?

56
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,630
He sure will.

57
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,000
I'll pick him up tomorrow.

58
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,180
Mommy was so nice.

59
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,220
And she still is, Roddily Doddily.

60
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,970
How do you know? Have you heard from her?

61
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,670
Oh, uh, n-no, sir.

62
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,550
But, uh, faith is believing in something without proof.

63
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,970
Uh, you can't see my lip below my mustache,

64
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,050
but you know it's there.

65
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,070
- Can I see it? - No.

66
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,380
My math teacher said

67
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,110
believing in something without proof is crazy.

68
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,810
You think the coat of many colors was crazy?

69
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,970
Noah's ark and the Holy Ghost, crazy?

70
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,200
Don't tell me you're doubting Balaam's talking ass.

71
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,110
Mommy, if you still remember me, give me a sign.

72
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,790
This is Homer Simpson auditioning

73
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,400
for the air guitar championship of the world.

74
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,970
I'm taking you down, Bjorn Turoque.

76
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,580
*Praise God from whom*

77
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,740
*All blessings flow*

78
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,330
*Praise God*

79
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:34,270
*It's almost time to go*

80
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,100
*This boring sermon*

81
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,810
*Must end soon*

82
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,030
*Arena football's*

83
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,470
*On at noon*

85
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,100
And for that simple reason, we are right

86
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:59,170
and Episcopalians are wrong, wrong, wrong.

87
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,540
Now I'd like to invite

88
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,660
our littlest parishioners to the front.

89
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,660
Gertie, a little traveling music, please?

90
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,640
Soon as we can, we're replacing her with Spotify.

91
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,660
I'm taking middle C.

93
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,900
So, tell me, young Christians,

94
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,350
if you could speak to Baby Jesus,

95
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,630
what would you say?

96
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,470
I'd say thank you for being born,

97
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,560
'cause that gave us Christmas.

98
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,470
Mmm, I'm killing it.

99
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,160
Ralph, what would you say?

100
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,280
I'd say, "Baby Jesus,

101
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,110
thank you for dying for our shins."

102
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,030
And you, Todd? What would you say?

103
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,010
I lost my voice from crying.

104
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,670
Oh, come on, young man.

105
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,110
You're my closer.

106
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,350
What would you say to Jesus?

107
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,820
I'd say...

108
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,550
thanks for nothing!

109
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,820
My mommy's dead and she's never coming back,

110
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,110
and I don't believe in God anymore.

111
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,610
No. No!

112
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,320
Thank God these collection baskets were empty.

113
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,440
You're welcome.

114
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:28,570
*A mighty problem is our Todd*

115
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,270
*His faith in God*

116
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,550
*Is failing*

117
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:40,030
*Homer accidentally killed his mom*

118
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:46,350
*He knocked her off a railing*

119
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,040
Now, son, let me put this gently.

120
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,040
We're all going to hell!

121
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,360
You opened a doorway to disbelief in God's own house!

122
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,550
Why does God need so many houses?

123
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,450
Couldn't some go to poor people?

124
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,590
You just stop right there, boy.

125
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,760
You do not question

126
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,570
God's real estate holdings and tax-free status.

127
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,830
I have to let off a little steam.

128
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,260
Shucks! Shucks! Shucks!

130
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,190
That's it. Young man, I am FaceTiming the reverend.

133
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,070
Reverend,

134
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,990
I know you hate it when I bother you.

135
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,450
It's okay. It's okay.

136
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,630
I'm at my daughter's ballet recital.

137
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,670
Oh, is she good?

138
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,110
Seriously, are any of them good?

139
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,350
Reverend, like the pharaoh's army in the Red Sea,

141
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,710
I'm in over my head.

142
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,720
My heathen son needs you right now.

143
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,340
Oh, sorry, got to go.

144
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,200
I have to read the last rites...

145
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,020
for the art of ballet.

146
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,510
Lord, please punish my boy thoroughly

147
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:57,930
so he may once again believe in thine divine mercy.

148
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:01,460
- Daddy, I have a problem. - Oh, you, too?

149
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,010
I accidentally watched a 30 Rock by mistake.

150
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,550
Oh! Oh, my good, good boy.

151
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,760
So it's okay to watch?

152
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,460
Just Kenneth. Just Kenneth.

153
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,840
Good morning, Rod. Todd. God.

154
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,300
- Good morning. - Morning.

155
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,300
Let us, uh, stiffly resume our nice, regular routine.

156
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,200
Dear Lord, we thank you for this breakfast,

157
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,740
each generic brand Circle-O a symbol of God's unending love.

158
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,700
- Amen. - Amen.

159
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,580
Todd?

160
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,760
Son? Can I just get an amen?

161
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,740
A prayer without an amen

162
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,870
is like a Tootsie Pop without a center.

163
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,170
Oh, I apologize for thinking the word "Tootsie."

164
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,270
But there must be a way

165
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,440
to scare religion back into my son.

166
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,380
Isn't there some hell on earth I could briefly place him in?

167
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,750
Let me in, boy!

168
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,450
The school bus will be here any minute!

169
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,590
To find your clothes, just solve this series of clues:

170
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,740
what has bark but no bite?

171
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,300
Um, the dog?

172
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,050
Wrong. A tree.

173
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,720
Here's another. If a plane crashes

174
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,960
on the border of North and South Dakota,

175
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,630
where do you bury the survivors?

176
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,060
Uh, Minnesota.

177
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,410
Wrong.

178
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:13,240
You don't bury the survivors. They're survivors!

179
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,300
I don't understand, but I'll bury you.

180
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,340
Tell you what. I'll give you your pants back

181
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,910
if you can answer this last one.

182
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,950
- What has two hairs on top... - Right.

183
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,570
- is somebody's dad... - Somebody's dad, yes.

184
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,260
and starting right now he's getting quite mad?

185
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,510
I don't know, but just give me my pants, boy!

186
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,480
Can we take pictures?

187
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,620
Wait, you see that, too?

188
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,760
That Simpson house

189
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,530
will put the fear of God in him.

190
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,420
Give me your pants.

191
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,230
Todd Flanders, I cast thee out.

192
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,300
*His little mind*

193
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,210
*Is filled with doubt*

194
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:59,420
*So now we have to cast him out*

195
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,370
*You'll learn the Lord is sweet*

196
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:09,560
*On his journey of 40 feet*

200
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,640
Daddy, do you love me more now?

201
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:20,760
Just by asking,

202
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,840
you have committed the sin of pride.

203
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,820
Yes, Ned, yes.

204
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,520
We'll keep him here till tomorrow.

205
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,430
Yes, I'll read him a good bedtime story.

206
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,400
Right, right. No wizards.

207
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,830
No pagans. No wild things.

208
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,960
How about The Very Hungry Caterpillar?

210
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,640
No, that celebrates gluttony.

211
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,460
Clifford the Big Red Dog?

213
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,560
Clifford the satanic abomination.

214
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,790
Everyone Poops?

216
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,920
Not me.

217
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,010
Todd. Psst! Todd.

218
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:50,590
I know what it's like to leave the faith of your family.

219
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,160
Thank you so much, Lisa.

220
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,000
At last, someone gets it.

221
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,490
But have I got a god for you.

222
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,080
Consider the Buddha. He brings peace from within.

223
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,930
He avoids the pitfalls of ego,

224
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,960
he loves yoga and Yoda,

226
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,870
and he's lost weight.

227
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,620
What happens when you die?

228
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,720
You get reincarnated as a human or an animal or a ghost.

229
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,830
Pass. Buddha's no god, and neither is God.

230
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,390
Don't worry, I'll get him.

231
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,890
By the way, what did you reincarnate David Bowie as?

233
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,090
Help me, love. It's Bowie.

234
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,040
I've been meditating too much.

235
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,630
Where's Todd?

236
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,640
It was horrible.

237
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,650
I woke up, and he'd cleaned my room.

238
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,470
What kind of psycho does that?

239
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,200
Hi, Grampa Simpson.

240
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,500
You're talking to me directly?

241
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,830
Even my Alexa won't do that.

243
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,950
Being with him has made me so tired.

245
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,610
Hey, Marge,

246
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,740
you may have noticed

247
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,600
I took a shower earlier this week.

248
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,690
I can't. I can't.

249
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,300
Not with Todd in the house.

250
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,860
Oh, we've had kids in the house for ten years.

251
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,350
Not that one. He's used to silence.

252
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,980
- He'll hear us. - No, he won't.

253
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,310
Yes, I will!

254
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,630
Oof! Got to get rid of that kid.

255
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,130
Can it be?

256
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,390
Oh, my goodness!

257
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:14,980
The face of our Lord and Savior in a humble piece of toast?

258
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,380
Clearly, no human could have made this.

259
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,630
Huh?

260
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,030
And the Lord said,

261
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,870
"Take this and eat, for I am the toast of the town."

263
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,580
- You drew that on. - No, no.

264
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,840
God drew it on. Look, he signed it.

265
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,520
"Jebus." See?

266
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,740
Why would God make toast that looked like Jesus?

267
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,640
'Cause parents are always showing off pictures of their kids?

269
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,170
So much innocent bread died for my sins.

270
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,660
So innocent.

271
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,910
*What is good*

272
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,090
*And what is sin*

273
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:54,590
*Bart wants to get rid of him*

274
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,940
Yo, this is Todd.

275
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,460
I have to share my room until he believes in God again.

276
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,360
You don't believe in God? Well, that's crazy.

277
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,080
Who else but an all-loving, omnipotent being

278
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,490
could create beautiful wedgies and purple nurples?

279
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,470
Not so fast.

280
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,570
What if I'm the only being in the universe,

281
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,340
and you're all my mental projections?

282
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,030
Project this!

283
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,970
I must have wanted this to happen!

284
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,100
So now that you see how bad kids turn out,

285
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,770
you want to go home, right?

286
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,330
Stop using us as examples!

287
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,790
I believe your friends are all going to Hell.

288
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,150
- Yeah! - Cool!

289
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,730
I hear you!

290
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,950
What doesn't that little twerp hear?

291
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:39,050
I don't know, but I heard that.

292
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,620
Okay. He can't hear us now.

293
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,540
Yes, I can.

294
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,350
You're unbuttoning your shirt, Mr. Simpson.

296
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,520
What does that paper say?

297
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,540
Oh. Hi, Todd.

298
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,230
Still seeking enlightenment?

299
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,650
I told you, not now.

300
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:01,000
Maybe I'll reconsider your stupid beliefs

301
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,540
when I come back as a worm.

302
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,060
In Buddhism, that's halfway to "Yes"!

303
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,200
Look, Todd, you don't have to believe.

304
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,920
In church, just smile and nod, but be sleeping on the inside.

305
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,310
That works at work, too.

306
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,150
But I really don't believe.

307
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:17,650
I'm sad because my mommy's gone and never coming back.

308
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,170
You know how that feels?

309
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,580
Oh, do I.

310
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,770
Oh, no, don't relive it. Don't!

311
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,400
You don't come home for dinner till 10:00 at night.

312
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,260
You never cook anything worth eating.

313
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,220
Well, who wants to cook for a failure?

314
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,380
Good God, woman, why did you marry me?

315
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,090
To piss off my mother, and it worked!

316
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:38,600
Tell the kid I love him, but I'm as bad at goodbyes

317
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,530
as I am at picking husbands.

318
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,540
My mom is gone.

319
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,190
And so is my ice cream.

320
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,300
And so is my hair!

321
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,640
Moe, I got to get drunk. And fast.

323
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,450
I'll take one, too.

324
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,360
What the...?!

325
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,580
I'm losing everything. Just give me a drink!

326
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,810
I'm sorry, Flanders. I can't pour you a drink.

327
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,630
You're too good. It's just, it's not something I can do.

328
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,310
Please. I'm begging you.

329
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,940
Yeah, that's $24.

330
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:17,750
*Ned Flanders is drinking today*

331
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:22,190
*Allelujah*

332
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:26,920
*His son Todd has gone astray*

333
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,270
*Allelujah*

334
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,820
*Raise your mug and drink it down*

335
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:40,330
*Allelujah*

337
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:45,260
*In the worst bar in this town*

338
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:50,300
*Allelujah*

339
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,060
You know, Homer, I always thought

340
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,720
you proved the existence of God.

341
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,620
I mean, you fall off cliffs, and you're fit as a fiddle.

342
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,050
Well, ain't that a diddle!

343
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,900
So this is what it's like

344
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,790
to look down on someone.

345
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,720
You know what, Ned? There may...

346
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,440
there may not be a heaven,

347
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,450
but getting drunk with you ain't hell.

348
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,560
Oh, you're great.

349
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,900
This is the beginning of a beautiful...

350
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,860
You killed them!

351
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,700
This is the worst Uber ride ever!

352
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,370
You're getting four stars.

353
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:40,540
No...!

357
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,400
Welcome to Heaven.

358
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,440
Oh, Lord. It's just as beautiful as I pictured it.

359
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,500
This is your version, Ned.

360
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,650
Homer gets his, too.

361
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,490
So, not like I'm feeling I put in way too much work,

362
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,220
but Homer got in, too?

363
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:16,190
Well, a couple of years ago, sloth became a virtue.

364
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,440
I don't really understand it.

365
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,050
You'd have to talk to my kid.

366
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,360
He's 33 and still lives at home.

367
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,360
I've been through some stuff, man.

368
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,980
Abe Lincoln!

369
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,290
Did you know the picture

370
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:31,870
about my life is Spielberg's biggest movie?

371
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:35,630
No! What about Jaws and E.T., and all the Jurassic...?

372
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,770
Well, how did I do in the awards?

373
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:40,060
- You were beaten by Argo. - Argo?!

374
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:44,100
That was the worst experience I ever had in a theater.

375
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,890
You have other people to see.

376
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:48,240
- Wear these passes. - Visitors?

377
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,400
Hmm, that's odd.

378
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,860
It must mean that your bodies aren't dead yet.

379
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:58,200
*We need you now oh God on high*

380
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:04,640
*So stupid Flanders and Homer don't die*

381
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:07,960
Ned Flanders, I swear to you I will use every ounce of skill

382
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,320
in my body to bring you back to life.

383
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,360
What about Homer?

384
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:14,160
Mm, que será, será.

385
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,720
Oh, my. They're holding a vigil.

386
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,930
Look how many, many lives Dad touched.

387
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,470
That's Flanders' vigil.

388
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,900
Dad's is over there.

389
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:37,670
Vigils are a surprisingly large part of this job.

390
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,820
Oh, yeah! So sad!

391
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,640
Dad's an acquired taste, Lis,

392
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,140
like Hawaiian pizza.

393
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,370
Dad never judged a pizza by where it came from.

394
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,630
He just ate it.

395
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,170
God, this is just you and me,

396
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,580
so I'm gonna tell you a secret.

397
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,300
I love my dad, so please don't take him.

398
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,920
Bart, what are you praying for?

399
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,010
New bike.

400
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:04,390
Are you sure you don't want to pray for your dad?

401
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,720
I can't pray.

402
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,220
I don't think anyone's listening anymore.

403
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,230
Oh, sweetie, prayer doesn't have to be to God.

404
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,820
It can also just be an honest conversation

405
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,450
we have with ourselves.

406
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,670
Just do what your heart tells you.

407
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:21,740
Oh, I'm not really sure what's happening,

408
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,970
but I'm really sad, and I need help.

413
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:29,370
*Rejoice, rejoice*

414
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:33,420
*O Springfield town*

415
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,420
*'Cause what goes up*

416
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:39,770
*Must come down*

419
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,100
I'm winning every bet!

420
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,740
And there's no stupid Fox halftime show.

421
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,710
Could Heaven be any better?

422
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,060
I agree. This is everything I could possibly dream of.

423
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,220
Todd is praying. He's praying for me.

424
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,560
And it's working!

425
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,410
I'm returning to my family!

426
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,450
Bye, Homer.

427
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,040
- Homer? - Mom?

428
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:17,860
I never got a chance to say goodbye, but now I can.

429
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,040
Remember, I'm not a hugger.

430
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,260
Oh, right. Sorry.

431
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,730
You never need to apologize to me.

432
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,510
In my eyes, you're perfect.

433
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,480
Ah, we're in Heaven.

434
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,100
Come here, you.

435
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,630
Oh, my God, this is all I ever wanted!

436
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,010
Aw, damn it!

437
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,820
Hallelujah! I'm alive and back in this big beautiful world.

438
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,980
I could kiss the first thing I see.

439
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,270
Ah. Promise is promise.

440
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,760
- Homie! - Dad!

441
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,290
- Doughboy! - Yay!

442
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:51,780
Daddy, you came back! I believe again!

443
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,980
Two lives saved by prayer.

444
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:55,740
And modern medicine.

445
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,670
This is why I became a doctor.

446
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,180
Because you both owe me $12,000.

447
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,340
No, no, no, no.

448
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,670
Nirvana is for closers, and you couldn't close the deal.

449
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,580
- But-but... - But-but-but-but-but nothing!

450
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,310
You couldn't even close Todd frickin' Flanders!

451
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,140
That kid would follow a butterfly.

452
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,020
Just give me one more chance.

453
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:20,790
Do you think I got to be Buddha by being patient?!

454
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:24,060
Check this out. I got you Ralph Wiggum.

455
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,400
Ralph Wiggum? What am I gonna do with Ralph Wiggum?

456
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,460
Everything is nothing!

457
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:32,820
Kid, you just blew my mind.

458
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,380
Good night, Roddy.

459
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:55,520
*Praise God from whom all blessings flow*

460
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,840
*Praise God*

461
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:01,970
*It's almost time to go*

462
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:08,650
*Todd has found just what he seeks*

463
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:15,350
*New episode in two weeks*
