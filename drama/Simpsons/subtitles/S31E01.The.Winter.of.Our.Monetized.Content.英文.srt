18
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,140
Fold down that...

19
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,130
and then up that...

20
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,290
and this and over there

21
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,540
and you have a beautiful swan!

22
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:19,670
What the...?!

25
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,210
This is Anger Watkins, and you're watching basic cable's

26
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,170
angriest sports show.

27
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,450
Folks, this is difficult to say,

28
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,510
but, today, I'm angry!

29
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,040
I like how angry he is.

31
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,750
I want to broach a topic

32
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,820
that no one else has the airtime to fill to discuss.

33
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,450
Greatest of All Time.

34
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,520
LeBron, Kobe or MJ?

35
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,110
I'll tell you why you're all wrong!

36
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,490
Let's open the lines.

37
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,260
The producer says I'm gonna go on.

38
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,930
Please, Sports Jesus,

39
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,370
guide my blather.

40
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,230
Welcome to Rage Nation.

41
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,500
What the hell is your problem?

42
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,300
Uh, first-time listener,

43
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,860
long-time caller.

44
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,610
So, I, uh...

45
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,470
Give me a take!

46
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,750
Anger needs a take.

47
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,450
Who is number one?

48
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,120
Uh, John Stockton!

50
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,490
John Stockton?!

51
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,720
We're trying to have our daily conversation

52
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,170
in which we rank and re-rank three demigods,

53
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:22,380
and you bring John "Never Won a Title" Stockton into the mix?!

54
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,490
Shame! For shame!

55
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,980
Dodbye.On!

56
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,660
Homer, you got flushed.

57
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,210
A man who don't know sports,

58
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,250
um, he ain't much of a man.

59
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,330
You're nothing to me now.

60
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,720
Just a husband and father.

61
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,440
Stupid Anger Watkins

62
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,440
flushing me with an audio effect.

63
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,640
Why not eat your feelings with a cheer-up kebab?

64
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,640
Let's see. Pizza slice,

65
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,360
summer sausage...

66
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,690
Here you go.

67
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,170
It was only a dumb call-in show.

68
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,500
Easy for you to say.

69
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,140
If that jerk didn't like your sports notions,

70
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,900
listen to someone else.

71
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,710
The Internet's full of homemade sports shows.

72
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,990
Anyone could put one on,

73
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,870
I mean, even... Don't say "You."

74
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,920
Don't say "You."

75
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,150
Even you.

76
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,030
Damn it.

77
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,970
Oh, yes. Of course!

78
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,250
An Internet sports talk show!

79
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,580
But where could I find a host

80
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,710
who thinks all my opinions are great?

81
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,100
Me.

82
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,300
Marge, prepare a congratulations kebab.

84
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,230
These are hard as rocks.

85
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,670
Food fight!

86
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,640
Uh, this calls for massive retaliation.

87
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,890
Use your quadratic equations, men.

88
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,770
Oh, my God. I'm having a flashback.

89
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,420
Good Lord, I'm reliving the Tet Offensive.

90
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,710
Skinner...

91
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,450
I'll Heimlich you, sir.

92
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,800
Just be still so I can embrace you from behind.

93
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,800
Get... off... me.

94
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,380
Shh, you're safe now.

96
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,580
Now, which of you little hoodlums tossed the first tot?

97
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,620
- The nerd did it. - Uh, could be Lisa.

98
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,090
Principal Skinner, it wasn't me. It was physics.

99
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,800
Is this true, Fizix?

100
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,830
I would've thought better of a Turkemenistan exchange student.

101
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,060
Ah! I had nothing to do with it.

102
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,670
I came to this country to escape food-based violence.

103
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,260
Lisa, one week's detention.

107
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,050
Welcome to Walkoff Homer!

108
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,300
This is Homer Simpson,

109
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,390
the rudest dude on the InnerTube.

110
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:18,210
They say Muhammad Ali was the greatest of all time,

111
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:21,050
but he never fought Cassius Clay.

112
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,970
What was he afraid of?

113
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,560
Boom! Hot take.

114
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,440
And how come, in basketball,

115
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,440
they use the basket all the time

116
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,590
but you could literally play football without any feet?

117
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,840
This show sucks.

118
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,350
I can't believe he's wasting Flanders' Wi-Fi on this.

121
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,030
Here's a few things that bug me.

122
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,410
How can they call traveling on a home team?

123
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,260
Why is soccer so stupid?

124
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,400
How can they play hockey in a garden?

125
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,830
Why can't golfers carry their own clubs?

126
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,080
Lazy jerks.

127
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,780
"Moose Poo"?!

128
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,900
Why, you hilarious...

129
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,300
Eat Sunset Rose!

130
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,100
Semi-gloss.

131
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,380
Seed bell?

132
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,390
Like that's gonna stop me.

133
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,680
Oh, so cute!

134
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,910
Look at...

135
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,970
Oh, my face! My face!

136
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,040
What the hell's so funny?

138
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,520
We must come together...

139
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,400
to lower our carbon...

140
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,280
- Stupid boy. - Dumb dad.

141
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,500
First, he ruins my life.

142
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,650
- Then he ruins my livestream. - Me ruining his show was

143
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,140
- the only good part of his show. - I'm gonna change the NHL

144
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,660
- with my idea - Fat goalie was his only good take.

145
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,610
- for morbidly obese goalies. - Should've led with it.

146
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,430
Hello. #FirstImpression.

147
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,490
Oh, my God, a hipster!

148
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,080
Marge, bring him a microbrew!

149
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,700
- Quick! - I'm on it!

150
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,560
The alluvial hops really bring out the riparian bitterness.

151
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,890
He likes it.

152
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,750
- I think. - I did like it.

153
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,480
My name's Warburton Parker.

154
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,750
I'm a stranger to you. Why should you listen to me?

155
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,480
You don't know my backstory.

156
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,120
Well, here it is-- colon--

157
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,870
as a child, my only friend was my computer.

158
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,380
I was teased every day.

159
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,790
Then I became a pro snowboarder,

160
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,630
married a supermodel, went into tech,

161
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,570
made a fortune, bought the factories

162
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,020
where the kids who teased me's parents worked

163
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,600
and shut the factories down.

164
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,730
Do you have a backstory?

165
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,220
Once, when I was six, I ate a radio.

166
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,640
I like you,

167
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,120
but that won't get in the way.

168
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,380
Let me cut to the chase.

169
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,120
I make money from viral videos.

170
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,860
And you two have gone viral.

171
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,170
"Raccoon in a revolving door" Viral.

173
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,010
You're right to dance in such a fashion.

174
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,550
Because I'll show you how to make videos

175
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,330
that will make you rich.

176
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,210
And me richer.

177
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,890
And me richest.

178
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,130
What are you doing here?

179
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,930
I get an alert whenever anyone's getting rich.

180
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:35,180
5.7Million views!

181
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,500
Wow! Good, not great.

182
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,370
That's the population of Colorado.

183
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,710
Is that the Broncos one?

184
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,250
It is.

185
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,440
The question is, how much money have you made?

186
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,810
Let's see. Uh, third quarter take...

187
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,180
- Factor in overhead. - Of course.

188
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,830
- Overhead. - Projections.

190
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,950
Apples to apples.

191
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,390
Figure net profit.

192
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,760
Got it. Nothing.

193
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,000
The question was rhetorical, you idiots.

194
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,540
Sorry about the "idiots" thing.

195
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:03,250
But what you need to do is monetize.

196
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:06,760
- Monetize! Monetize! - Monetize! Monetize!

197
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,380
Monorail. Monorail.

198
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,230
Wait, what are we talking about?

202
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,780
Perhaps you are familiar

203
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,910
with the greatest viral video of all time,

204
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,510
"Monkey smells finger and falls out of tree."

205
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,180
No, I've never seen...

206
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,290
Oh, my... Oh...

207
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,690
Oh, that monkey!

209
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,880
And the-the monkey!

210
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,860
He smelled his finger.

212
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,710
Then boom!

213
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,500
Smell.

214
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,910
That monkey and that monkey's estate

215
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,050
made zero dollars.

216
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,080
Even less in monkey dollars.

217
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,430
If he had signed with me,

218
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,770
I mean, just hypothetically,

219
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,470
there would be-- oh, I don't know--

220
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,960
Monkey Finger Sniff T-shirts,

221
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,690
Monkey Finger Sniff Finger Wipes,

222
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,500
Monkey Finger Sniff sponsorships

223
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,760
and a spot on Weekend Update on SNL.

224
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,000
Host, Rami Malek or better.

225
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,540
Musical guest, Pitbull.

226
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,920
What this monkey didn't sniff was opportunity.

227
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,040
In the next five minutes, you'll get more views

228
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,380
than the entire rebooted Murphy Brown.

229
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,990
Ugh, such high hopes.

230
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,390
Not the same without Eldin.

231
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,850
Now, this fight, you're gonna get kickback from...

232
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,370
-Duff Beer? -Look at your shirt.

234
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,200
Label to camera.

235
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,420
Hey, label to camera.

236
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,390
They're gonna love this publicity.

237
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,080
You guys just earned your first quarter.

238
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,630
First quarter revenue?

239
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,200
No. First quarter, like the coin.

240
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,080
Halt and Catch Fire, boy!

241
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,310
Silicon Valley!

243
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,160
How the Web Was Won.

244
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,430
I'll give you another quarter to shut up.

245
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,390
Monetize.

248
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,070
Look at us,

249
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,090
the bully,

250
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,350
the princess,

251
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,510
more bullies,

252
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,430
the Ralph

253
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:12,200
and me, the smart kid no one gets.

254
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,190
Yet, maybe, by the end of the day,

255
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,530
I'll realize this is just what I needed.

256
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,510
This is what I needed to break through the...

257
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,050
Lisa, you don't belong here.

258
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,250
Oh, thank God. So long, delinquents!

259
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,500
Your detention is being held in our new facility, the R.O.C.C.

260
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,030
Welcome to the Remote On-site Correctional Center.

261
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,800
How can something be both remote and on-site?

262
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,490
All right, Wisenheimer.

263
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,060
You just earned yourself a day in the HOLE.

264
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:38,410
The Holistic Obstinance Lessening Environment.

265
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,970
There's nothing in here but old Goosebumps books.

266
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,420
Fine. Read those.

267
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:49,440
They aren't scary. They aren't scary!

268
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,990
What happened to regular detention?

269
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,370
Well, because we could no longer afford

270
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,970
any after-school activity,

271
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,130
the school district has outsourced detention.

272
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,940
Welcome to Misbehavior Solutions,

273
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,770
a Torture 500 company.

274
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,950
You privatized detention?

275
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,470
Lisa, you have to understand.

276
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,610
Anyone who's done anything remotely poor

277
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,020
is in private prison.

278
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,120
Oh, did I say "Poor"? I meant wrong.

279
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,390
No more questions.

280
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,530
So, how's the monetizing going?

281
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:16,730
Pick a hand.

282
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,210
Pick again.

283
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,450
Not the same hand.

284
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,510
I'm not a magician. It's in the other hand.

285
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,840
Please pick the other hand.

286
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,730
All right, I'm just gonna show you the check.

287
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,290
Oh, my God!

288
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,500
$5,000!

289
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,790
This will come in handy when I buy a boat!

291
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,550
Now, for the really big money,

292
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:37,440
I sold the location rights to your next fight.

293
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,820
Huh? No, no, no. This needs to be a discussion.

294
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,780
It's here in this fried chicken restaurant.

296
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,730
End of discussion.

297
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:46,160
You see, this place has an image problem.

298
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,760
They've had nine salmonella deaths

299
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,540
and one fried pinky in the past week.

300
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,510
Salmon-ella.

301
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,820
So they want you two-- you and you--

302
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,480
to change the conversation.

303
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,030
If there's a regional, casual dining chain

304
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,680
that needs my help, I'm there!

305
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,230
My heroes.

306
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,740
Okay, kind of, you know, fake nibble.

307
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,670
- Pretend you're enjoying the thighs. - I am.

308
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,890
Uh, they're made of wax.

309
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,650
Whatever. I'm on my fourth bucket.

310
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,920
Sad. Okay, just action.

311
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,910
And escalate and escalate.

312
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,700
Views, views, views.

313
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,820
Yes!

314
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,140
Feel the burn. Literally sit in it.

315
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,240
Would you like some onion rings?

316
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,870
I don't see why not.

317
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,790
Ah. Beautiful.

318
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,640
Look at those view numbers fly.

319
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,300
I-I shouldn't say this.

320
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,590
No, I-I'm gonna say it.

321
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,080
Okay, I say it a lot.

322
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:49,580
You two are more beloved than Marathon-Diarrhea Guy.

323
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,200
- I love that guy. - Best guy.

324
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,550
We have so many sick sponsored fights lined up.

325
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,860
We're gonna make Marathon-Diarrhea Guy look

326
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,060
like Dog on Washing Machine.

327
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,720
- I love that dog! - Best dog.

329
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,290
Violence is the best.

330
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,930
Dad, you're holding my hand.

331
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,990
Is that weird?

332
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,630
I've seen it in books.

334
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,290
Say, boy, can I buy you a...?

335
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,030
Nah, I'm good, but thanks.

336
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,400
Give me a Duff, Moe.

337
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,830
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Your money's no good here.

338
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:24,660
You're a celebrity now, Mr. YouTube.

339
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,400
The biggest one this bar has seen

340
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,220
since the snake that ate three pool balls.

341
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,150
Got a picture of that. See it?

342
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,490
Anything I can do for you.

343
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,050
Anything. You just name it.

345
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,520
Well, little more than I thought you'd ask for,

346
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,620
but, uh, no, I respect the greed.

347
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,330
Now I'm going back to my people.

348
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,800
Hey, how you doing?

349
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:49,220
It's that kid from YouTube!

350
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,710
You, my friend, are getting an escort.

351
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,370
Aw, isn't that cute?

352
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,200
Let's give the biggest one a gun and take the week off.

353
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,560
{\an8}ROCC

354
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,350
Milhouse, why are you in detention?

355
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:09,080
For using the metric side of my ruler.

356
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:11,440
That seems pretty arbitrary.

357
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,460
Uh, why am I here?

358
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,310
All I did was wear swim trunks in the shower.

359
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,390
They're packing detention with minor infractors.

360
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,600
But why?

361
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,640
Why do corporations do anything?

362
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,060
To help society.

363
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,460
We need you to make kiddie license plates.

367
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,360
I need 100 Caitlyns, 100 Kaitlyns

368
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,030
and a thousand Kate... Lynns.

369
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,210
Oh, my mom's picking me up.

370
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,770
She'll be frantic!

371
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,400
Oh, they said I could pick him up at midnight.

372
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,830
You want something stamped?

373
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,470
How about this?

375
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,710
Strike! Strike! Strike!

376
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,930
Strike! Strike! Strike!

378
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,500
Strike! Strike! Strike!

379
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,160
How do you know about unions?

380
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,910
'Cause our history books end in the 1930s.

381
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,240
Thanks, guys.

382
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,560
Hey, Dad!

383
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,490
Hey, son! I kind of missed you.

384
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,410
I kind of missed you, too.

386
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,230
Okay, they're hugging.

387
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,370
Excuse me, but I thought the hate was real.

388
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,730
I have not been so angry

389
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:13,470
since I saw every Star Wars since the second.

390
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,820
They are no longer my heroes!

391
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,790
Kumiko, we are changing the Comic-Con costumes.

392
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,650
We're going back to our old costumes--

393
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,560
Sailor Moon and the Moon.

397
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,830
Hey there, Chalmers. Hey there, Skinner.

398
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,270
We will be here until dinner!

399
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,260
These Norma Rae-sinets refuse to back down.

400
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,020
You can cut detention with a knife.

401
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,710
In other news, the Pope has died.

403
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,220
My corporation has a deal with this school

404
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:50,400
to provide free... kishly happy workers.

405
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,220
You better fix this and fast.

406
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,800
I think I have an answer.

407
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,870
I know people who will do anything for money

408
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:00,620
as long as it doesn't involve kids--

409
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,260
the teachers.

412
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,100
*Well, I been workin' in a coal mine*

413
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,760
*Goin' down, down, down*

414
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,360
*Workin' in a coal mine*

415
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,160
*Whew, about to slip down*

416
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,720
*Workin' in a coal mine*

417
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,500
*Goin' down, down, down*

418
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,230
*Workin' in a coal mine, whew...*

419
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,470
Take it from the Moon.

420
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,750
Bart and Homer have cratered.

421
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,130
I hate them and I-- uh-oh.

422
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,430
So, because people think you like each other,

423
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,560
you're has-beens.

424
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,120
Yesterday's views.

425
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,670
Deader than MySpace.

427
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,300
15 minutes of lame.

428
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,460
Why are you still here around me?

429
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,590
Please help us. It hurts so much to know

430
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:40,240
that no one is clicking me or liking me.

431
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,040
They might have no opinion.

432
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,630
I can't live with that!

433
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:46,920
May I make an original and groundbreaking observation

434
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,320
that no one has ever said before?

435
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,330
There is one thing that show business loves.

436
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,030
- Betty White? - A comeback.

438
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,560
We are going to put you out in front

439
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,980
of some of the greatest influencers

440
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,210
and tastemakers alive.

441
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,510
We will remake Bart and Homer Brand.

442
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:02,500
What do you say to BHB2?

443
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,180
Is it a drug? Lay it on me.

444
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,810
It stands for "Bart Homer Brand 2," You moron.

445
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,630
Of course it is.

446
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,410
Is it a pill?

447
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,230
Or the other end?

448
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,560
This is the largest gathering of social media influencers

449
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,260
in the western hemisphere.

450
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,180
There's Detonator,

451
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,360
the Internet's leading walkthrough gamer.

452
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,730
What's your side quest, Demon?

453
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,630
- Uh, well, I... - Terminate dialogue tree.

454
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,860
Return to main quest.

455
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,760
Hey, there's Leslie Sky.

456
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,830
She does makeup tutorials with veiled white nationalism.

457
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,990
For the foundation, we can either go with brown,

458
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,340
or skin color.

459
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,550
Oh, my God, it's Jurgen,

460
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,550
Southern Norway's leading unboxer.

461
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:44,770
First we take the burger box from the bag, yeah.

462
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,800
Carefully open the box so it can be reclasped.

463
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,050
Robust hinging.

464
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,050
I am tired now.

465
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,700
And winter comes.

466
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,260
And now, to tell you what you're gonna do.

467
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,030
Mortal Kombat: Live Online.

468
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,930
Doesn't "Mortal" Mean "Dead"?

469
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,310
Um, it can, but it's just a figure of speech.

470
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,250
So we don't kill each other?

471
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,980
Oh, if you did, that would be great.

472
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,460
But let's play it by ear.

473
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,520
Okay, guys,

474
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,880
when you're in combat,

475
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,390
definitely killing each other,

476
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,590
it's important to feature your sponsored weapons.

477
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,200
Bart, you're promoting Netflix.

478
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,270
Got it? And Trident gum.

479
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:34,110
Homer, you're repping Axe Body Spray

480
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,700
and Trident Spearmint gum.

481
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,800
Do you get it, Homer?

482
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,730
The product things match the words.

483
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,600
I don't know, this seems kind of lame.

484
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,810
You know what's not lame?

485
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,870
An audience of 200 livestreams

486
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,510
while you kill your own father.

487
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,460
Or whatever. Feel it out.

488
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,890
I don't know, I'm gonna need some more inspiration.

489
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,600
Oh, my God, is it really you?

490
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,660
It is.

491
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,610
Ladies and gentlemen,

492
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,900
YouTubers, Instagrammers,

493
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,820
and homeless former Viners,

494
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,060
you loved them in their smackdown at Panda Express.

495
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,670
Then they hugged and you were like, "What?"

496
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:17,180
Homer and Bart Simpson!

497
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,610
Do I smell fear?

498
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,300
I'm not afraid of you.

499
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:25,320
You're smelling the refreshing scent of Axe Body Spray.

500
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,510
Dark Temptation.

504
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:40,380
I don't know, Dad. This just doesn't feel right.

505
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,880
I don't want to fight you.

506
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,680
Me, neither, son.

507
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:50,970
Who'd have thought that two guys from such different worlds

508
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,930
could connect like us?

509
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,830
Quit using your words!

513
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,700
Hello. I'm Homer Simpson.

514
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,490
And this is episode two of Walkoff Homer.

515
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:28,700
Today's question:

516
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,900
are sports talk shows a complete and utter waste of time?

517
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,700
We will get to the bottom of this

518
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,800
within the next five hours.

519
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,450
Five hours?!

520
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:39,770
I can't get my point across in five hours.

521
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,260
My whole career depends on me

522
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,870
never quite getting to the finish.

523
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,030
Because I know...
