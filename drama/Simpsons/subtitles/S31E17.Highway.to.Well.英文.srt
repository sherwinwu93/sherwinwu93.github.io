21
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,960
Come on, Maggie.

22
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:11,860
Hi. Sorry we're late.

23
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,920
This is Maggie. We're here for our first day.

24
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,350
Hello, Maggie. And who will be picking her up?

25
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,810
W-- A-After she falls down?

26
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,830
No, at the end of the day.

27
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,810
Wait, I don't stay with her?

28
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,390
Research shows pre-toddlers learn best

29
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,360
in a parent-free environment.

30
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,180
Unless you want to stunt her growth, which is great.

31
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,220
We're not supposed to judge.

32
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,900
No, no, it's not that.

33
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,920
I just don't want Maggie to feel abandoned.

34
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,590
So, we'll see you at 4:00.

35
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,730
Oh. Okay, then.

36
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,090
Hmm. Now what will I do with the rest of my day

37
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,330
I know. I'll ask my favorite mommy blog.

40
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,370
Now turn that resistance all the way up!

41
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:02,130
Come on! I want to see you bitches suffer!

42
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,330
Am I the only one who heard that?

43
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,290
I love it.

44
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,190
It's like being coached by the voice inside my head.

45
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:13,710
Spin yourselves to death, you land manatees!

47
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,920
Paint harder, you sausage-fingered no-talents!

49
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,060
"Sex-prise your man at work."

50
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,700
What are you doing here?

51
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:36,330
Maybe you could give me a safety inspection.

52
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,060
Oh, my God, I can't believe this is happening.

53
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,380
I'm so sex-prised!

54
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,900
There's security cameras everywhere,

55
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,710
so we'll have to snuggle under the desk.

56
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,590
On top of the desk, please.

57
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,150
Thanks, Jerry! Nice. Real cool.

58
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,950
Now how do I fill the day? Hmm.

60
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,780
What's Well Plus Good?

61
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,680
It's pronounced "Well and Good."

62
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,020
Ugh, why is everyone talking to me?

63
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,310
Well, if all these people want to work here,

64
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,060
maybe I want to work here.

66
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,760
All right, go to tablet seven

67
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,750
to take your pre-application ethics assessment.

68
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,070
Cool hair, by the way.

69
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,090
You think that my hair is cool?

70
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,660
Well, thank you, Lauren.

71
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,700
Oh, by the way, your name tag is upside down.

72
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,350
Mm, thank you.

73
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,660
You're the only person to mention that.

74
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:39,110
Major mom vibes. She's perfect.

75
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,200
"I always never lie."

77
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,820
Two. "I sometimes always never lie."

79
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,920
"If I never found a wallet, I would always give it back."

80
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,820
What color is the wallet?

81
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,160
Marge Simpson. There was never a test.

82
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,900
Except there always was.

83
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,750
- There wasn't? - And you passed.

84
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,100
Welcome to the Well and Good family.

85
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,270
The rest of you can go. Your résumés will be deleted.

86
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,860
I'm the only one you hired?

87
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,730
You're the only one we partnered with.

89
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,740
Okay, so I work here now.

90
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,490
I never asked what we sell.

91
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,970
I can figure this out.

92
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,640
Candy? Bath bombs? Blowtorches?

93
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,840
$30 bottles of soda?

94
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,190
Excuse me.

95
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,460
Do you recommend the tincture or the oil?

96
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,470
I-- the-the tincture is more expensive, I guess.

97
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,590
Look, this is about you.

98
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,490
And taking care of you. I think.

99
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,890
So you have to put yourself... first?

100
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,900
Well, your no-frills, fumbling sales pitch

101
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,000
has won me over. I'll take both. Yes...

102
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,200
Wow, girl, you just made a hundred-dollar sale.

103
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,870
You're gonna fit in great here.

104
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,170
Thing is, what does here sell?

105
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,220
Is this what RadioShack is now?

106
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,040
No. We're a high-end cannabis boutique.

107
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,880
You sell pot?!

108
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,750
Technically, I check I.D.s.

109
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,240
You sell pot.

110
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,980
I'm a drugs dealer!

111
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,740
Cannabis is legal in this state now.

112
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,550
Well, so is water-skiing,

113
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,720
but that doesn't mean I have to sell it!

114
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,300
I'm sorry.

115
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,180
Marge, don't leave, seriously.

116
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,390
Like, I'm asking.

117
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,710
Drederick Tatum! I own your countertop grill.

118
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,270
Take care not to use metal utensils on the non-stick surfaces.

119
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,850
But anyway, after my boxing career ended,

120
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,360
I was in a lot of pain.

121
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,180
Specifically, in my punching hands

122
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,450
and my blocking face.

123
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,020
But following a regimen of CBD oil

124
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,530
and medicinal hits from a Pikachu bong,

125
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,670
I was able to enjoy life again.

126
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:51,290
Which inspired me to create Well and Good Healing Emporiums.

127
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:55,090
But pot is for Cheeches... and Chongs.

128
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,660
Marge, it's not about getting high.

129
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,760
It's about wellness.

130
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,850
And that's why I've hand-picked the perfect team here.

131
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,230
I'm an expert in cannabinoids and cutting-edge delivery systems,

132
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:09,320
aka infusers, decarboxylators, transdermals and pet suppositories.

133
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,050
And I'm super hot.

134
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,660
And what do you need me for?

135
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,630
Marge, people know you want to help them, that it's safe here.

137
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:19,360
Not some place for Cheeches and Chongs, as you so recently put it.

138
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,610
Uh, I'm sorry. I don't think this is really me.

139
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,220
Good luck with your lifestyle.

140
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:28,820
Oh, it's a shame there's no drug for hurt feelings.

141
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,590
Oh, wait, there totally is.

143
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,040
You know, in some families, they go around the table

144
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,750
and everyone says one thing they learned that day.

145
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,590
Okay. I learned that.

146
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,450
Well, I learned that the former heavyweight champion

147
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,980
of the world owns a marijuana store.

148
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,340
And he offered me a job, which I turned down.

149
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,410
Wait, what?

150
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,710
I mean, the people were really cool,

151
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,240
and they thought I was cool,

152
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,910
which made me feel "Stoked."

153
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:04,780
But I'm not going to be a reefer saleslady.

154
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,040
Well, I guess there's nothing wrong with it.

155
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,570
Cannabis is legal in this state.

156
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,950
Yeah, it's basically the same thing as working in a liquor store.

157
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,710
You can work in a liquor store?

158
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,270
Stay with us, big guy.

159
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,940
Wow. I thought you'd be opposed to it.

160
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,950
People are stressed out these days.

161
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,330
Scurvy is back, there's, like, 60 wars going on.

162
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:30,750
Whales are eating our precious ocean plastic.

163
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,420
Maybe people want to smoke a doob for that.

164
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,990
Oh, yeah, everyone's selling crap to stoners now.

165
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,510
Have you seen the new Krusty Burger commercial?

167
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,540
When you've got the munchies, for some reason--

168
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,840
wink, wink-- you crave weird.

169
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,770
A deep-fried rib-wich served on a warm doughnut.

170
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,870
Or a spaghetti-filled grilled cheese sandwich

171
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,100
drizzled with ranch pudding.

172
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,590
Krusty's Munchie Mouthfuls.

173
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,160
It's high time you tried it.

174
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,670
Get it? Get it?!

175
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:06,860
Get it?

176
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,430
I get it.

177
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,070
Well, Mr. Tatum did personally choose me.

178
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,550
He said I was helpful.

179
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:18,140
Honey, you're the most helpful person I've ever met.

180
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,770
Now go sell the safe legal drugs

181
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:24,040
our kids should never, ever use!

182
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,770
Especially Bart!

185
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,990
Is this an Apple store?

186
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,790
Everyone keeps asking that.

187
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,340
I dropped my phone because of my arthritis.

188
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,010
We can't fix your phone,

189
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,630
but I can sure help with that arthritis.

190
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,820
Try this amazing pain-relieving lotion.

191
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,990
Oh. It tingles.

192
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,610
Not like Jergens. I hate Jergens!

193
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,840
You seem stressed. Hmm.

194
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,340
Why not try some yummy gummies?

196
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,000
Marge, thank you.

197
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,100
When Mother's happy, I'm happy.

198
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,030
Or at least, much less miserable.

199
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:10,180
This big shot here is the principal of a whole school!

200
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,280
Show her your key ring.

201
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,780
Oh, I love it.

202
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,360
Psst. I want to buy some pot.

203
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,800
All right, pump the brakes, Jhorts.

204
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,950
Got to ask a few questions first.

205
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,680
Now, do you want a body high

206
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,230
or a front-of-the-face buzz?

207
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,050
I don't know. Just hook me up.

208
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,960
Mmm, I have the perfect strain in mind.

209
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,560
But be warned, boo,

210
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,720
the couch-lock is strong on this one,

211
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,180
but there's, like, zero mind earse.

212
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,720
W-What are you saying? I just want...

213
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,080
weed.

214
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,970
Okay, almost there. Almost there. Now listen.

215
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,650
Do you want this in flour...

216
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,150
...shatter, topical...

217
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,950
...edible, nasal mist...

218
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,040
...ear drops?

219
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,280
Look, I just want to score a bag of shwag

220
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,380
from some dude who may or may not be a cop.

221
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,330
I'm a cop.

222
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,640
Have you tried this?

223
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,160
Nothing makes sense anymore!

224
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,920
Give me a beer.

225
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,420
It doesn't make my hair smell like anything!

226
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:26,020
I dreamed my whole life of legalized weed.

227
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,990
Turns out it's a real buzzkill.

228
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,370
Ain't that the truth?

229
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,770
Times have changed.

230
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,090
The romance of alcohol is fading into the past.

231
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:37,520
Stoners will never know the joy of sitting on the toilet

232
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,540
and barfing into your own underwear.

233
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,340
Or picking a fight with a guy twice your size

234
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,920
because his leg touched your car.

235
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,110
Yeah. I miss the old days, too.

236
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:50,930
When buying pot was... scuzzy.

237
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,140
I'd pay anything to turn back that clock.

238
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,460
You know what'd be popular?

239
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,130
If one of those legal places

240
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,010
made it feel like you were scoring weed

241
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,820
from your old-school pot connection.

242
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,170
That's a great idea, and we should do it.

243
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,800
Those tie-dyed bong monkeys

244
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,870
will cough up big-time for the full dirtbag shebang!

245
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,860
I'll alert the bong monkeys.

246
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,910
Afternoon, gernts. You need some suds?

247
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:21,100
Duffman knows it's always time for a refreshing Duff!

248
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:22,710
Yeah, that being said,

249
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,560
sometimes Barry is looking for a little herbal refreshment.

250
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,310
Know what I mean?

251
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,100
Right this way, fellas.

252
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,480
So you guys friends of Moe?

253
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:38,490
Yeah. Uh, these guys are cool.

254
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,960
Whoa, tight. Come on in, gentlemen.

255
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,250
Oh, wait. Here's a disclaimer, man.

256
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,420
"This is a legal dispensary,

257
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,260
"Compliant with all laws and statutes.

258
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,330
"As part of the experience,

259
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,240
cast members may pretend it's illegal."

260
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,180
All right. Shall we?

261
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,830
Hmm. Crazy bird, rusty free weights,

262
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,430
everything smells like a damp swimsuit...

263
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,850
I'm home.

264
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,520
Who are you supposed to be?

265
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,540
I'm the weird friend who never acknowledges you.

266
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,820
I was that guy for my old roommate Scott.

267
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,040
Just stick it in the Band-Aid can.

268
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,260
Wh-- It's all stems and seeds.

269
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,680
Thank you.

276
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,600
So, with the success of the Well and Good brand

277
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,020
which, you know, thank God--

278
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,840
I'm so pleased to present our latest venture...

279
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,040
This is The Drederick.

280
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,690
It's a fully realized cannabis resort and spa.

281
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,510
Now, for our launch event,

282
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:01,090
we'll be inviting marijuana influencers from Dave Chapelle

283
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:04,200
to Harrison Ford, who is flying himself, by the way,

284
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,160
so you know, fingers crossed.

285
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,800
Marge, I was thinking that you would be

286
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,550
the hostess of this launch party,

287
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:13,130
acting as the de facto face of the Well and Good brand.

288
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,870
Oh, my God. Why me?

289
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,590
Well, Marge, 'cause people trust you.

290
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,940
Also, my face is the intellectual property

291
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,270
of the artist who created this tattoo.

292
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,510
So, you know, I'm out.

293
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,720
Oh, I'd love to.

294
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,630
This is so exciting, I...

295
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,600
Wait, wait, no. I wanted to ask you.

296
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,690
But unfortunately, there was a fly in the CBD ointment.

297
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:37,240
Your husband Homer is selling weed, Marge.

298
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,860
That's terrible.

299
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,930
Wait, no, so am I. We all are.

300
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,740
We are trying to elevate the image of cannabis.

301
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,860
This is what he's doing.

302
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:54,290
Oh, he knows how much self-esteem I get from selling bud.

303
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,360
And that's our good frisbee.

304
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,260
I'm afraid that you cannot continue with this company

305
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:03,490
while your husband is taking pot back to the dark ages of 2018.

306
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,670
- I-I'm very sorry. - Oh, no. No, no, no.

307
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,570
Please, please don't fire me.

308
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,520
I want to be your face.

309
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,580
When Homer realizes how much this is hurting me,

310
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,760
I'm sure he'll understand.

311
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,730
I don't understand.

312
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,620
We're doing the same thing, except you dress like a doctor,

313
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,890
and I dress like a cool toddler.

314
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,180
Don't you get it?

315
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,780
I'm a healer, and you're a dealer.

316
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,030
You need to quit.

317
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:31,540
I can quit whenever I want. I just don't want to.

318
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,930
What happened to the quitter I married?

319
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,370
I quit quitting!

320
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,940
- What's going on? - Mom and Dad are having a drug war.

321
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,360
- It's not different! - And you spent $1,000...

322
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,080
I make CNN much funnier!

326
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,000
Homer wouldn't quit.

327
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,460
Here's my smock, my key to the hash register,

328
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,690
my business card reading "Associate."

329
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:57,960
Instead of being the face of the company,

330
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,460
my face will just be me.

331
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,610
Wait, Marge. There is one way to save your job,

332
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,240
but it would entail the betrayal of your husband,

333
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,530
which I would never ask you to do.

334
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,660
Well, I mean, it doesn't hurt to ask.

335
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,990
With your help, we can get the government to shut him down.

336
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,410
The FBI? The DEA?

337
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,730
The County Health Department.

341
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,020
I don't understand. What crime is Homer committing?

342
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,310
Pot's legal.

343
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,440
Yes, but he isn't licensed to serve

344
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,330
non-psychotropic edibles, aka food.

345
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,730
If he offers snacks to his customers and they eat

346
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:40,080
even one bite, we go in and take him down.

347
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,980
So we need you to bait the trap with these.

349
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:44,960
Are you in?

350
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,060
Nailed it.

351
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,930
You're the son I never had.

352
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,460
Hey, Homer. Look who's stopped by over here.

353
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,540
I am so sorry about our little tiff.

354
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:03,120
Will you accept this apology gift for you and your friends?

355
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,670
Oh honey, you're always in my corner.

356
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:10,640
I have the most loving, supportive, loyal wife in the world.

357
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,930
If Simpson keeps eating like this,

358
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,790
he'll hit bottom dust before anyone takes the bait.

359
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:29,460
Come on, you fat bastard, offer the customer some cheese balls.

360
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:36,450
And the whole floor is an air hockey table,

361
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,570
so moving furniture, is like...

362
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,930
Homer! Give your friends some cheese balls.

363
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,510
Would anyone care to partake?

364
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,450
- Code Orange. - Go, go, go!

365
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,020
Stop eating!

366
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,760
Health Department. This is a raid.

367
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,310
We got to get rid of the stuff.

368
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,110
Oh, no! Come on!

369
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,490
Oh, God!

371
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:17,040
We got everything we need.

372
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,750
You're shut down, pal.

374
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,720
You, you knew.

375
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,770
- You... - Set you up.

376
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:32,110
You're coming with us, scumbag, to pay a $25 fine.

378
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:44,290
Marge, darling, everything is so perfect.

379
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,620
I hope your husband wasn't too upset about the...

380
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,110
you know, the treachery.

381
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:52,170
Oh well, Homer is very easygoing, so...

382
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:55,060
Excuse me, can any of these oils or goos

383
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,390
help me with a knife wound?

384
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,870
I have been stabbed, in the back!

385
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:04,410
How did you get in? This is by invitation only.

386
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,810
I said I was Kevin Smith's father.

388
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,290
No one questioned me.

389
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:13,670
Homer, control yourself. You're upsetting the influencers.

390
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,840
They're very easily influenced.

391
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,620
That guy is on alcohol.

392
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,050
Please don't ruin this.

393
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:24,800
This is cannabinoid health, and I am its face.

394
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,420
Cabana boy health.

395
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,910
If it's so good for you...

396
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,870
why have you never tried pot, ever?

397
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,660
Well-- does a doctor need to try insulin

398
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,170
to know that it helps diabetes?

399
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,750
Yes. I think she should.

400
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,950
Surprise! The doctor's a woman.

401
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:49,810
Sexist!

402
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:50,650
Oh, yeah.

403
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,260
- Good point. - That is sexist.

404
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,310
Look, I don't have a problem with pot.

405
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,470
I can start any time I want.

406
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,890
I'll do some right now.

407
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,930
Perfect. "Serenity."

408
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,640
See? Nothing.

409
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,220
I'm probably one of those people it doesn't work on.

410
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,100
I feel like I'm on an elevator

411
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,730
that's going up and down at the same time.

412
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,750
Something's wrong. You said this was about wellness,

413
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,280
but I feel high.

414
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,600
Okay, okay, listen.

415
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,990
What you need to understand is this,

416
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,090
I'm high, too!

417
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,550
I'm Serenityed out of my gourd.

418
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,480
Yeah, baby.

419
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,180
I've got to come down. I've got to eat something.

420
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:45,250
Um, that was a chicken pot pie.

421
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,110
Oh, no. I ate an eatable.

422
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,920
And you just wiped your mouth with a Hash-nap,

423
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,620
the most potent thing here.

425
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,380
Is this how I always walk?

426
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,930
What do I do with my arms? OK, got it, this is normal.

427
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,600
Honey, it's me.

428
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,750
Homie.

429
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,850
You're gonna be okay.

430
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,600
In two hours ‭that will seem like 12.

431
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,450
You're so sweet.

432
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,140
And I ratted you out.

433
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,630
No, I get it.

434
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,930
You found a place that made you feel special,

435
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,620
and you didn't want to lose that.

436
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,690
I still feel weird.

437
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:34,490
Maybe you'd feel less weird if I were weird, too.

438
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:37,270
Here, I'll smoke one of your futuristic joints.

439
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,690
That's not a doobie!

441
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,570
Oh, man, Dad, what did you do?

442
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,970
Hemp clothes burns like paper!

443
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,000
All wrong, all wrong, all wrong!

444
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:08,760
Be cool.

445
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,840
Cheer up, neck face.

446
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,590
If there's one thing I know, it's life is nothing but pain.

447
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,330
People will always need guys

448
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:18,600
like you and me to get them wasted.

449
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,100
Yeah, thanks, monster man hallucination.

450
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,580
Your words are a-a great comfort to me.

451
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,100
We'll get through it somehow.

452
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,950
Well, can I come with y...

454
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,640
In reaction to the destructive Drederick blaze

455
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,550
which also destroyed the Sign Language Monkey Sanctuary,

456
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,990
the town council has passed an emergency ordinance

457
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,910
outlawing the sale of cannabis.

458
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,620
Without that tax money,

459
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,990
Maggie's pre-education center will have to close.

460
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,620
Aw, man, they were teaching her Mandarin.

461
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,060
Well, it's probably for the best.

462
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,400
Even though they say something's not addictive,

463
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,230
you can still get hooked.

464
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,050
And you don't want that.
