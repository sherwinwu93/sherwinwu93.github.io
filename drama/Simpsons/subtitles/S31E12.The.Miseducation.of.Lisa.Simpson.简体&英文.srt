You mean, I'm in a gifted class?

159
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,710
我们不喜欢这种说法
Ooh, we don't like that term.

160
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,680
每个人都有天赋
Everyone is gifted.

161
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,390

{\an8}算法

172
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,140
以至于到处都能看到算法的存在
that every aspect of it is run by an algorithm.

173
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,160
关于算法谁能给我举个例子
Who can give me an example of an algorithm?

174
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,520
就像是你在网上买了一个垃圾桶
Like when you buy a new garbage can online

175
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,560
往后余生都能看到垃圾桶的广告

176
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,150
就像你看一些YouTube上的近景魔术视频之后
Or like when you watch a bunch of close-up magic videos on YouTube

177
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:09,280
就会看到自杀求助热线的广告
and get ads for a suicide hotline.

178
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,490
没错
Exactly.

179
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,570
因为你们都喜欢这个课程

然后我们学习了计算机科学
then we did computer science,

186
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,010
后来我们学习了认知计算机科学

187
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,340
真想不到  丽莎喜欢学校

189
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,330
没
Nothing.

190
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,770

充电后再送回去

00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,050
你们和天才班的学生一样都值得成功机会

284
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,760
那意味着为真正的职业做准备
That means preparing for real careers,

285
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,680
而不是打零工

311
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,180
我唯一喜欢过的学校
I've ever liked in my whole life!

312
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,680
只有一小部分学生
It's just not fair that only a small group of kids

313
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,790
能得到高等教育太不公平了
are getting an advanced education!

314
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,710
这不正是天才班存在的意义吗
Well, isn't that the point of a gifted class?

315
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,270
丽莎  算法的目的
Lisa, the algorithm's purpose

316
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,520
就是让孩子们为将来的工作做好准备
is to prepare kids for the jobs of tomorrow.

317
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,980
但算法只教孩子们如何完成当天的跑腿任务
But it's just teaching them to be the task rabbits of today.

318
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,780
没人知道明天的工作内容是什么
Nobody knows what the jobs of tomorrow are gonna be.

319
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,990
我确定算法知道
Well, I'm sure the algorithm does.

320
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,180
来让我问问它
Here, I'll ask it.

321
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,370
等等  这不可能
Wait, wait, this can't be.

322
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,770
只有一项工作内容
There's only one.

323
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,230
这下我们完蛋了
We are so screwed.

324
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,250

我的天  又来
Aw, geez. This again?

329
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,010
我们有着积极向上的生活方式
Yeah, we have an active lifestyle,

330
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:51,090
包括每天喝汽水
and part of that is drinking soda all day.

331
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,010
如果你们这么爱喝的话
If it's refreshments you want,

332
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,600
为什么不让人类给你们倒汽水
why not let a man pour your soda!

333
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,640
一名人类男性
A human man.

334
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,980
一直以来我们都在放任
For too long we have done nothing

335
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,650
任由机器替代我们的工作  帮我们洗碗
as machines have taken over, washing our dishes,

336
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,270
给我们注射胰岛素  现在又是这个
pumping our insulin, and now this!

337
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,820
人类可以比任何专门为了倒汽水
Man can pour soda better than any machine

338
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,990
而订制的机器做得更好  我会证明的
made specially for that purpose, and I will prove it!

339
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,620
今天是机械崛起结束的日子
Today the robot uprising ends.

340
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,100
今天是人类的独立日
Today is our Independence Day!

341
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,080
{\an8}约翰·侯默的歌谣

342
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:25,320
*侯默倒了许多杯汽水*
*Well, Homer pulled a lot of sodas*

343
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,740
*因为他憎恨汽水机*
*Because he hated that machine*

344
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,720
*他糊涂啦  以为机器会抢了他的饭碗*
*He got confused, thought it was gonna take his job*

345
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,640
*所以侯默成了倒水人  老天老天*
*So Homer was a soda-pouring man, Lord, Lord*

346
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,920
*侯默成了倒水人*
*Oh, Homer was a soda-pouring man*

347
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,440
*他没能证明自己的观点*
*He did not make his point

348
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,320
*而且他的汽水又不冰又没气*
*And his sodas were warm and flat*

349
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,530
*所以侯默成了倒水人  老天老天*
*So Homer was a soda-pouring man, Lord, Lord*

350
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:54,140
*倒汽水可不是什么正经事*
*Soda-pouring's not a real thing*

351
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,310
*根本不是*
*No, sir*

352
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,370
或许侯默倒汽水要慢一些
Homer might have been slower,

353
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,580
但他倒的汽水富有人类情感
but his pours had a human touch.

354
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,710
脸上挂着微笑  饱含兄弟情谊
Always delivered with a smile and a sense of brotherhood.

355
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,710
讲的真好
Yeah! All right!

356
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,080
但他死了  是机器赢了
But he died. So machine wins!

357
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:18,060
不  等一下  他喝了太多汽水
No, no, wait. His pulse was beating so fast

358
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,500
脉搏跳动得太快了都模糊了
from all the soda he drank that it was a blur.

359
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,560
也许终有一天
Perhaps one day machines will be better

360
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,770
机器会比人类更擅长倒汽水  但绝不是今天
at pouring soda than man, but not today!

361
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,090
我们的工作保住了
Our jobs are safe!

366
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,210
职业发展做准备
for the jobs of the future.

367
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,290
但在将来  我们在这所学的工作
But in the future, all the jobs we've learned here

368
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,880
都将由机器人完成
will be done by robots.

369
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,030
给人类做的工作只有...
The only job left for humans will be...

370
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,160
照顾老人
Elder care!

371
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,100
这份工作连机器人都不愿做
The one job even robots won't do.

372
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,680
那STEM呢
What about STEM?

373
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,170
这才是它真正的含义

大家都不该看到裸体的老年人

383
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,740
除非那是你的癖好
Unless that's your kink.

384
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,580
我们让这算法见识一下我们真正的想法吧
Let's show this algorithm what we really think of it--

385
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,980
用我们这代人最强有力的手段
with our generation's most powerful tool:

386
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:29,110
