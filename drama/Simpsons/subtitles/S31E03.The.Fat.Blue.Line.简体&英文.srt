90
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,010
海王在这里不是为了在胸上签名
Aquaman is not here for the signing of boobs.

91
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,290
那是另一场在万豪酒店C会议室的活动

92
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,710
公元250年  伊格那丢·卡斯特兰纳塔兄弟
In 250 A.D., Brother Ignatius Castellaneta

93
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,770
拒绝公开宣布他放弃信仰基督教
refused to recant his Christian faith.

94
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,980
于是罗马人砍下他的头
And so the Romans chopped off his head,

95
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,270
他们砍下他的手臂
they chopped off his arms,

96
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:38,720
他们砍下他的腿  和他的脚趾
they chopped off his legs, and they chopped off his toes.

97
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,140
他们用冻住的蛇做成的箭射他
They shot him with arrows made of frozen snakes

98
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,180
拔出他的眼睛  并把他的眼珠
and they pulled out his eyes and replaced them

99
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,030
换成了巧克力脆皮开心果
with chocolate-covered pistachios.

100
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,590
但是伊格那丢依然拒绝屈服
But still, Ignatius refused to recant.

101
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,530
所以他们用樱桃起泡酒煮了他的骨头
So they boiled his bones in sparkling cherry wine.

102
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,970
这就是为什么要用意大利千层冰激凌
So that's why the thrice-martyred saint

103
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,370
纪念这位三次殉道圣人
is remembered with spumoni,

104

现在  让我们展示出对耶稣深厚的敬意

110
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,730
他不需要钱
He doesn't need money.

111
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,440
我听说他爸富得流油
I hear his father's loaded.

112
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,260
我的钱包去哪了
Hey, where's my wallet?

113
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,800
我的钱包也不见了
Yeah, my wallet's gone, too.

114

116
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,290
我们都是泛滥的偷包案的受害者

117
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,680
做点什么  水豹[恶搞黑豹]
Do something, Wet Panther!

118
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,720
无名三只手真的偷了那么多钱包吗
Peter Piper picked a peck of pocket wallets?

119
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:56,010
{\an8}钱包去哪了

120
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,510
其偷包的行为导致多少人流离失所
How many paupers did Peter's pocket picking produce?

121
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,740
恐怕在盯裤子狂魔面前没有一条裤子能幸免
I'm afraid no pants are safe from this Dockers stalker,

00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,440
但是韦警长表示  他一定解决这个谜团
But Chief Wiggum vows he will solve this pickle of a puzzle.

124
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,510

你丈夫的臀部比咱俩加起来都大

侯默  我们把跟踪设备放在你的钱包里
Homer, we're placing this tracking device in your wallet.

Then you just have to put that sweet seat meat on the street.

165

让我把你的钱包往上拉一点
Now let me pull your wallet up

166
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,090
这样它就能刚好露出来一点

167
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,570
别别别  让我来
Uhp-bup-bup. Allow me.

与你工作了大半辈子的同事
Ah, you work with two guys all your life

181
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,050
你自以为了解他们

却被他们背叛  阿卢还有那个谁
Betrayed by Lou and, uh, the other guy.

房间怎么在旋转
The-the room is spinning.

197
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,540
原来这就是无辜的感觉
So this is what it feels like to be innocent.

198
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,210
原来这就是与我无关的感觉
And this is how it feels to be irrelevant.

199

出于最浪漫的原因  惯性

我爱他的无惧失败
I love him because he's not afraid to fail.

He has boundless unjustified confidence, and you should, too.

220

我突然看到了破云而出的光芒
Boy, suddenly, I-I see a break in the clouds.

我不会让你失望的  马姬
I will not let you down, Marge.

万能的主  我不是个爱祷告的人
Almighty God, I'm not a praying man.

233
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,500
对我来说  下跪通常意味着走向不归路
For me, getting down on my knees is often a one-way trip.

234
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,100
我当警察是跟魔鬼做了交易
I-I know I made a deal with the devil to be chief,

235
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,450
但请先别管它  帮帮我  好吗

裤子都没让穿就被押过来了

242
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,530
差点连收费表都没拿
I was barely able to grab my rate clock.

243
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,970
去他妈的收费表  把我弄出去

245
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,570

扒窃  别说那么慢
Pickpocketing! Quit talking slow!

249
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,830
好
All right.

250
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,960
其实我是无辜的
Actually, I'm innocent.

251
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,050
无辜  无辜吗
Innocent?! Innocent?!

252
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:47,200
法官根本不会信你
A judge wouldn't believe you for a second.

253
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,480
我无能为力了
I've got nothing to work with here.

254
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,990
你还请律师干嘛  就是你干的
What would you even plead? You really did it this time.

255
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,610
不是我干的
I didn't do it.

256

我要揍他吗  老板

好的  我会"带他出去"
Got it. I'll "usher him out."

259
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,140
我是指领他出去
I mean show him the door.

260
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,920
对  我会"领他出去"
Right. I'll "show him the door."

261
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,960
不管你以为的是什么  反着做
Whatever you think I want you to do, just do the opposite!

我唯一不会犯的罪行就是扒窃
The one crime I would never commit is pickpocketing.

267
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,230
他看起来很真诚

268
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,190
我就是认真的
I am sincere.

269
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:45,970
我还是小男孩时  我爸爸法斯托·安东尼奥
When I was a boy, my father, Fatso Antonio,

270
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,720
要做心脏移植手术
needed a heart transplant.

271
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:51,680
但是那颗心脏在路上被偷了
On its way to the hospital, that heart was pickpocketed.

272
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,140
没有任何伟大的男人该这样死去
My father died the way no made man should die:

273
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,970
竟然是自然死亡
of natural causes.

274
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,050
老天  我发现了一条线索
Oh, my God. I discovered a clue.

275
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,010
我发现了一个电动牙刷
I found an electric toothbrush.

276
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,840
至少他今晚能好好睡觉了
Well, he'll sleep good tonight.

277
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,820
我敢肯定他是无辜的
I can tell he's innocent,

278
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,120
就凭我曾把上百个无辜者送进监狱
with a certainty you can only develop

279
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,970
培养出来的直觉
putting hundreds of innocent people in jail.

我觉得你是无辜的
I think you're innocent.

288
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,650
但是你得努力说服我
But you're gonna have to convince me

289
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:34,600
无视你过去的那些恶行
to ignore your entire past history.

290
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,790
我并非生而富贵
I was not born a rich man.

291
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:44,410
在我的成长环境里  只有靠拳头才能生存
Where I grew up, there was one way out: your fists.

292
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,530
或者靠那些提供给意大利裔年轻学生的
Or the many scholarships available

293
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:49,080
大量奖学金计划
to young Italian-American students.

294
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,020
但是奖学金申请表上要填写个人信息
But the forms required information,

295
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,040
我是不会告密的
and I ain't no snitch.

296
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,470
我开始失去信心了
All right, I'm losing my confidence.

297
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,780
是你干的  对吧
You did it, didn't you?

298
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:59,440
以这位前神父的名义发誓  不是我
I swear on this former priest that I didn't do it.

299
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,350
他无罪
He's not guilty.

300
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:04,340
-我知道什么是有罪  -我可以证明
- And I know guilty. - And I can prove it.

301
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,430
-那证明呀  -我只说我可以
- Well, go ahead. - I said I can prove it.

302
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,590
没说我愿意
I didn't say I would.

303
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,300
为啥不愿意
Well, why wouldn't you?

304
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:14,550
因为我当时在做的事不是黑帮老大该做的
Because what I was actually doing at the time is something

305
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:18,090
不能被别人知道
a mob boss cannot do and let people know.

306
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,890
如果你配合  我对天发誓
If you help me, I swear an oath

307
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:22,070
我们会找到那个陷害你的人
we'll find the guy that framed you.

308
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,080
好吧  我告诉你犯罪发生时
All right, I will show you what I was doing

309
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,850
我正在做什么
when the heist went down.

310
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,010
这太难为情了  保证是真的
It's so embarrassing, it has to be true.

311
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,540
把你手机给我
Give me your phone.

312
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,650
{\an8}正经商人俱乐部  监控录像
密码:不是我

313
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,310
我每天这个时候都这么做
This is what I do every day at that time,

314
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,860
刚好是犯罪发生的时间
the time of the crime.

315
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,990
你会看到  我走进私人办公室
As you will see, I walk into my private space,

316
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,450
漱口
I gargle,

317
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,140
然后  你自己看吧
and then, God help me, I...

318
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,850
*好时光和坏时光*
*Good times and bum times*

319
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,680
*我都见证过  亲爱的*
*I've seen them all and, my dear*

320
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,680
*我还在这里*
*I'm still here*

321
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,780
*奢华的天鹅绒*
*Plush velvet sometimes*

322
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,620
*或者简单的零食加啤酒*
*Sometimes just pretzels and beer*

323
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,960
*我依然坚守在此*
*But I'm here... *

324
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,920
现在你知道了  我一个人的时候爱唱金曲
Now you know. When I'm alone, I sing show tunes.

325
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,050
你没偷走那些钱包  你偷走了我的心
You didn't steal those wallets. You stole my heart.

326
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,160
快点开
Leave it on.

327
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,470
*十年黑道头头  饱经风霜*
*Ten years a mob boss, hits and whacks *

328
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:25,540
*收买法官市长  从不交税*
*Bought judges and mayors, and never paid tax*

329
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,080
停  够了
Okay, that's enough.

330
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,620
有些太够了
Definitely enough.

331
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,160
{\an8}春田监狱

332
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,720
{\an8}马桶通心粉

333
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,700
我们今天就能放你走
We're gonna get you out today.

334
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,490
谢谢你  警长
Appreciate the offer, Chief,

335
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,320
但是牢狱生活改变了我
but prison has changed me.

336
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:44,130
我想我该直接放弃出狱  服满刑期
Now I'm thinking I should just give up, serve out my term,

337
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:47,620
然后坐在肉店门口沐浴暖阳
then sit in the warm sun outside the butcher shop.

338
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,190
你不是一直都这么做吗
Isn't that what you always did?

339
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,470
确实  但是每过几小时
Yeah, but every few hours,

340
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,750
就会有人在我耳边说悄悄话
someone would whisper something into my ear,

341
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,190
我得决定是点头还是耸肩
then I had to decide whether to nod or shrug.

342
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,610
压力使我坐立难安
It was very stressful. The agita.

343
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,710
我以为你想找出陷害你的家伙
Uh, I thought you wanted to get the guy who put you here.

344
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,860
我确实想
I do.

345
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,900
我们会的  如果你愿意带窃听器
Well, we will, if you will wear a wire.

346
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,490
抱歉  这是原则问题  不行
I'm sorry, but on principle, that is something I cannot do.

347
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:16,380
再说一遍  我不能这么做
Let me repeat: something I cannot do.

348
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,910
{\an8}好哒:)

349
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,220
{\an8}路易吉餐厅

350
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,700

00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,860
{\an8}晚安好梦

353
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,260
记得说短语来求救
Now, remember the phrase to call for help.

354
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,430
-什么短语  -记得说短语
- What phrase? - "Remember the phrase."

355
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,180
我会的  什么短语
I will. What phrase is it?

356
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,390
记得说短语
"Remember the phrase."

357
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:52,720
如果你告诉我我当然会记得的
I would if you would tell me what it is.

358
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,870
短语就是"记得说短语"
The phrase is "remember the phrase."

359
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:57,570
这是我听过的最蠢的事了
That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

360
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,730
记住  你的人生指望着我们呢
Just remember, your life depends on us.

361
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,300
而且拜托  别亵渎这个词
Oh, and please, no profanity.

362
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,970
我跟夫人会玩这个游戏
I play these for the missus

363
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,500
当我们  当我们感觉来了的时候
when we're, uh, we're getting in the mood.

364
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,870
敬胖东尼  一个神似波提切利裸体画的人
A toast to Fat Tony, a man like a Botticelli nude

365
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,190
只不过又胖  又老  容易陷害  是吧
fat, old and easy to frame, huh?

366
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,970
大家好
Hello, fellas.

367
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,280
胖东尼  我只是在表达对你的思念
Fat Tony. I was just saying how much we missed you.

368
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,470
对吧  对吧  各位
Huh? Huh, guys?

369
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,820
-当然了  -我们这么说过
- Oh, yeah, sure. - Yeah, we said that.

370
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,710
安静  我不想听见任何人的声音
Quiet! I don't want to hear anybody

371
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,700
除了告密者弗兰基
but Frankie the Squealer.

372
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,250
你你你想...你想从我这里听到什么
W-W-What do, w-what do you want to hear from me?

373
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,540
那个陷害你的人的名字吗  我绝对不说
The name of the man who framed you? I would never.

374
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,230
我没说过是强尼·守口如瓶
I didn't say Johnny Tightlips.

375
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,970
我绝对不会说是强尼·守口如瓶
I would never say Johnny Tightlips.

376
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:43,560
各位  我们的新老大  强尼·守口如瓶
Ladies and gentlemen, our new boss, Johnny Tightlips.

377
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,760
原来是你  强尼
So, it was you, Johnny.

378
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:49,130
-什么  喂  -你
- What? Hey! Whoa! - You!

379
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,780
虽然你给的都是消极的回复
After all your passive-aggressive replies

380
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,320
和一脸不高兴表情  我却绝想不到是你
and bitter looks, I never would've guessed.

381
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,290
你把我沉默寡言的天性误认为是忠诚
You mistook my taciturn nature for fealty.

382
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,720
但那仅仅是因为在社交氛围中
But it was simply that I didn't feel comfortable

383
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,450
我感到很不舒服
in social situations.

384
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,020
之后我看到这样一个广告
Then I saw this commercial

385
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,480
一朵悲伤的云去跟太阳约会
where a sad cloud goes on a date with the sun.

386
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,210
之后我去跟我的医生聊帕罗西汀的事
So I talked to my doctor about Paxil,

387
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,430
这种药给了我信心去背叛你
and it gave me the confidence to betray you.

388
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,630
现在这是我的团伙了
This is my crew now.

389
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,970
对吧  吉米·拍马溜须
Ain't that right, Jimmy Kissass?

390
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,870
您一直是我的最爱
You was always my favorite.

391
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,910
你呢  桑尼·人云亦云
What about you, Sonny Go-along?

392
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,970
其他人都同意那我没意见
I'm good if everyone else is.

393
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,050
-你呢  威利·怎么都行  -怎么都行
- Willie Whatever? - Whatever.

394
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,510
还有你呢  乔伊·不读空气
And you, Joey Can't-Read-the-Room?

395
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,160
你疯了  没人会同意的
You're nuts! Ain't none of us gonna go along with this!

396
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,670
是的  你看  那个...你没...不是
Yeah, see, that's-- you didn't-- that's not...

397
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,460
*一个普通的小镇女孩*

398
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,940

*要去哪里*
*Going anywhere*

402
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:00,380
这份意面太好吃了
Mmm, this pasta's delicious.

403
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,280
我得了解一下是什么酱汁
I'm gonna find out what the sauce is.

404
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,190
记得说短语
Remember the phrase.

405
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,610
说什么短语
Remember what phrase?

406
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,380
对了
Oh, right.

407
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,280
酱汁
Ooh, sauce.

408
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,970
天哪  我中枪了
Oh! I'm hit!

409
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,870
正中菊花...中心
Right in the heart... of your ass.

410
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,940
得有人给我把子弹吸出来
Someone's got to suck out the bullet.

411
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:29,190
韦根  该死  这是你生来就该做的
Wiggum, damn it, this is what you were born to do.

412
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,130
*别停*
*Don't stop*

413
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,220
他醒了
There he is.

414
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,080
有一瞬间我们以为失去你了  冠军
We thought we were gonna lose you for a minute there, champ.

415
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,800
你得谢谢警长
You have the chief here to thank.

416
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,600
他的极速吮吸可能救了你一命
His quick suction may have saved your life.

417
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:46,580
谢谢
Thank you.

419
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,590

Well, Wiggum, I have to say, when I first met you,

420
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,800
我觉得你非常无能
I thought you were totally incompetent.

421
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:58,890
然后呢
And?

422
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,780
然后呢
And?

423
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,890
