00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,160
多谢照顾
Thanks for hosting.

20
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,750
过夜怎么样
How was the sleepover?

21
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,140
他俩都喝了5小时能量饮料和一大罐能多益
They each had a 5-Hour Energy drink and a jar of Nutella

22
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,440
然后看了一整晚俄罗斯的行车记录仪录像
and then watched Russian dashcam videos all night.

23
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,770
开车就是杀人
Vodit' znachit ubivat'!

24
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:19,850
听着  马姬
Listen, Marge.

25
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,080
柯克和我每年都在哥斯达黎加租一栋豪华别墅
Every year, Kirk and I rent a luxury villa in Costa Rica

26
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,300
然后邀请几个精选的家庭跟我们一起
and invite a few select families to join us.

27
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,760
你可能听说过
Maybe you've heard about it?

28
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,900
我一直做梦都想被邀请去参加旅行
I've always dreamed of being invited on this trip,

29
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,130
现在终于要实现了
and now it's about to happen.

30
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,330
表现要拽  马姬  只有你能去的样子
Play it cool, Marge, like only you can.

31
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,940
我看看
Let me see.

32
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,030
哥斯达黎加
Costa Rica...

33
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,360
不行  不行
Nope, nope.

34
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,600
不好意思  第一次听说
Sorry, it's news to me.

35
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,490
我们想问问  你家有没有兴趣
We were wondering, would your family

36
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,150
加入我们呢
be interested in joining us?

37
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,920
你什么时候需要答复
When would you need an answer by?

38
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,600
越快越好
Oh, the sooner the better.

39
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,330
哥斯达黎加
Costa Rica!

40
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,680
哥斯达黎加
Costa Rica!

41
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,390
是时候一起摇
Time to rock and...

42
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,110
哥斯达黎加
Costa Rica!

43
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,750
哥斯达黎加  哥斯达黎加  哥斯达黎加
Costa Rica! Costa Rica! Costa Rica...!

44
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,930
哥斯达黎加
Costa Rica.

45
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,320
家庭会议
Family meeting!

46
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,380
全体到位
Right now!

47
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,140
范浩腾一家邀请我们
The Van Houtens invited us

48
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,260
参加他们超高端的多家庭旅行
on their super-exclusive multi-family vacation

49
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,710
去哥斯达黎加
to Costa Rica!

50
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,440
我们会待在沙滩上的奢华别墅里
We'll stay in a luxury villa right on the beach...

51
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,220
就在原始雨林旁边
...near pristine rain forests,

52
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,420
那里是地球上百分之五的物种的家
home to five percent of the species on Earth...

53
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,330
生物多样性
Biodiversity!

54
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:40,180
那里的孩子完全可以带着弯刀
...in a land where it's normal for kids to carry machetes.

55
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,420
快点合法化
Legalize it!

56
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,390
你可以嚼这本指南书
And you can chew on the guidebook.

57
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,930
我总是做梦想成为那种
I've always dreamed of being the kind of family

58
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:50,560
别的家庭愿意和我们相处的家庭
that other families would be willing to do things with.

59
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,340
哥斯达黎加
Costa Rica!

60
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,400
-哥斯达黎加  -机场美食广场
- Costa Rica! - Airport food court!

61
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:56,710
-机场美食广场  -哥斯达黎加
- Airport food court! - Costa Rica!

62
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:05,150
{\an8}《哥斯达黎加的树蛙》

63
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,610
这才是永远不会停下的鼓膜
Now, that's a tympanic membrane that just won't quit.

64
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,130
等一下  这趟旅行要花掉多少来着
Whoa. This trip's gonna cost how much?

65
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,470
我知道很贵
I know it's expensive,

66
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,750
但我们一辈子都在担心钱
but we spend our whole lives worrying about money.

67
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,660
因为我们没钱
That's because we don't have that much.

68
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,240
我们有按揭  反向抵押借款
We have a mortgage, a reverse mortgage.

69
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,430
我觉得房子其实是车子的
I think the house is owned by the car.

70
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,330
生活就是有关经历
Life is about experiences.

71
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,590
看看这张希伯特一家去年旅行的照片
Look at this photo the Hibberts posted from last year's trip.

72
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,500
再看看我都发了什么
Now look at my feed.

73
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,590
没错
Yeah.

74
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,190
天哪
Oh, boy.

75
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:34,960
我想要一张我们在瀑布那边的照片
I want a photo of you and me by that waterfall.

76
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,200
能踏上这趟旅行的可能性是我允许
The hope of going on this trip is the only reason

77
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,370
巴仔和苗浩斯成为朋友的唯一理由
I've allowed Bart to stay friends with Milhouse.

78
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,110
现在我可明白一切了
Now I understand everything.

79
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,180
侯默  我知道这挺紧张的
Homie, I know it's a stretch,

80
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,700
但如果柯克和露安可以承担
but if Kirk and Luann can afford it...

81
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,130
就是啊  他赚不到那么多钱
Yeah. He can't earn that much.

82
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,390
他的工作是拖走无上衣女仆面包车
His job is moving the Topless Maids van

83
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,390
这样他们就不用被罚款
so they don't get parking tickets.

84
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,280
我们就疯狂一次  希望一切都好
Let's have one damn fling and hope everything will be okay.

85
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,240
晓得不  你是对的
You know what? You are right.

86
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,470
我不想做婚姻中负责的那个人了
I am sick of being the responsible one in this marriage.

87
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,960
咱们好好活一把
Let's live life.

88
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,090
记着  只要我们拥有彼此
Remember, we can never be poor

89
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,590
咱就不穷
as long as we have each other.

90
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,120
不  我们会穷的
Oh... yes, we can.

91
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,760
我们不如呆在家里
You know, what if we stayed home

92
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,770
拼一幅哥斯达黎加的拼图
and just did puzzles of Costa Rica?

93
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:25,490
这趟旅行听着真的很贵
I mean, this trip sounds really expensive.

94
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,960
-根本不贵  -瞎说啥呢
- No, not really. - What? No!

95
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,980
让大人操心大人的事儿吧  好吗
You just let the grown-ups worry about grown-up things, okay?

96
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,270
你老爸老妈
Your mom and dad

97
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,760
完美掌控着我们的财政未来
have our financial future all under control.

98
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,560
瞧  免费券
Ooh! Free ticket!

99
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,180
富人更富
The rich get richer!

100
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,550
多家庭旅行
Ah, the multi-family vacation.

101
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,120
瞧瞧有哪些人
Let's see who we've got.

102
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,270
范浩腾一家  当然了  希伯特一家
The Van Houtens, of course. The Hibberts.

103
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,860
丘督学和他的女儿
Superintendent Chalmers and his daughter.

104
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,990
不敢相信我爸爸竟然我把我们分开
I can't believe my father is tearing us apart

105
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,820
整整一周
for a whole week.

106
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,700
宝贝  飞行过程很长
Sweetie, it's a very long flight.

107
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,710
怎么不省着点电
Why don't you save your phone battery.

108
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,950
你在乎的就是这点电吗
All you care about is batteries!

109
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,840
你从来就没爱过
You've never been in love.

110
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,680
我和你的妈妈有过一段非常
Your mother and I had a very...

111
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:10,520
算了
Never mind.

112
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,140
好了  这里的每一个人
Yep, not one person here

113
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,530
我都不介意和他们度过漫长的时间
I'd mind spending an extended period of time with.

114
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:19,130
我没时间脱毛  所以就在飞机上解决吧
I didn't have time to wax, so I'll do it on the plane.

115
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,860
那玩意儿来这干什么
What the hell is that doing here?

116
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,630
警察阿卢和他的姐姐本来准备要来
Well, Lou the cop and his sister were gonna go,

117
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,270
但是他被广告牌砸到了
but a billboard fell on him

118
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,830
她的风铃店被烧了
and her wind chime store burned down.

119
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,590
所以我推荐了帕蒂和她的新女朋友
So I suggested Patty and her new girlfriend.

120
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,670
你故意瞒着我
You deliberately hid this from me

121
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,670
现在退出也来不及了
until it was too late to back out.

122
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,810
-是的  -别想否认
- Yes. - Don't try to deny it.

123
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,720
帕蒂的新感情关系一定要有结果
Patty's new relationship really has to work out,

124
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,490
因为约会软件都不肯让她上了
because the dating apps won't take her anymore.

125
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,080
我只需要你对她们好点就行了
All I ask is that you're nice to them.

126
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,920
伊芙琳  这是我的丈夫侯默
Evelyn, this is my husband Homer.

127
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,940
非常礼貌地跟你问好  女士
A very polite hello to you, madam.

128
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,130
看啊看啊  侯默·辛普森
Well, well, Homer Simpson.

129
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,380
我听过好多关于你的事情
I've heard so much about you.

130
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,390
你当然听过了  但是我要为自己辩解
Surely you have, but in my defense,

131
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:03,080
在私家的旋转木马上小便
urinating on a privately owned merry-go-round

132
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,610
不是随地小便
is not public urination.

133
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,480
{\an8}多家庭度假航班

134
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,030
好了  谁想喝鸡尾酒
Okay, who wants Miguelitos?

135
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,600
我应该提醒一下新来的
Now, I should warn the newbies--

136
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,470
这些对你们来说一定非常真实
these will seem very authentic to you.

137
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,820
这就是装在杯子里的"纯生"
This stuff is pura vida in a glass.

138
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,480
什么是"纯生"
What's pura vida?

139
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,830
就是纯粹的生活的意思
Uh, it means "pure life."

140
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,990
算是这里的一种心态吧
Kind of a state of mind down here.

141
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,340
非常平静
Very chill.

142
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,020
比你想象的平静
Like what you think of as chill

143
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,630
再平静个一百万倍
but, like, a million times chiller.

144
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,320
老侯  我觉得我体验到了
Homie, I think I'm having an experience.

145
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,990
每次水果与美酒的碰撞  神奇的假期就诞生了
Every time a fruit meets a booze, a magic vacation is born.

146
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,800
你可以试一下
Well, you can try.

147
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,010
天啊  我都不知道
Oh, boy, I didn't know that.

148
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,690
太真实了
So true.

149
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,290
罗德里戈  罗德里戈  我的朋友
Rodrigo, Rodrigo, mi hermano,

150
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,170
把账算在这上面
put the bill on this.

151
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,820
没有什么比大家分摊更像纯粹的生活了
Nothing is less pura vida than check-splitting.

152
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,680
这趟旅行我预付所有的费用
On this trip I pay for everything up front--

153
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,640
食物  别墅的租金
food, the villa rental,

154
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,100
云林谋杀之谜
cloud forest murder mystery--

155
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:43,240
{\an8}付款账目

156
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,460
我全都记录在这
and I keep track of 'em right here.

157
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,400
我们到最后的时候再算
Then we settle up at the end.

158
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,850
牧翁·布兰丁斯今晚
Smokey Blandings is putting on

159
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,210
展现出了教科书般的沙包洞技术
a cornhole clinic tonight.

160
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:55,890
{\an8}沙包洞
邀请赛

161
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,990
这是真正开始疲劳的时候  吉姆
And this is where fatigue really sets in, Jim.

162
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,020
你扔出第四个沙包的时候
When you're tossing that fourth beanbag,

163
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,070
肌肉都要尖叫了
your muscles are screaming, son.

164
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,040
真是个好日子
Good heavenly days!

165
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,730
你也在追职业沙包洞巡回赛
You also follow the pro cornhole tour?

166
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:05,560
当然了  我之前在我爸爸的农场里玩
Sure do. I used to play on my daddy's farm.

167
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,460
我们一整天都在扔沙包
We'd toss bags all day,

168
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,230
就算比烫手的山芋还热的时候也不例外
even when it was hotter than a two-dollar pistol.

169
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,350
那的确很热
That is hot.

170
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,440
你说话一直都这么有南部色彩吗
Do you always speak in such colorful Southern-isms?

171
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,580
负鼠妈妈会错过星期天礼拜吗
Does a mama possum skip church on Sundays?

172
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,870
我猜她会的
I bet she does.

173
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,080
侯默  把你的手机收起来
Homer, put your phone away.

174
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,470
伊芙琳  别这样
Evelyn, please.

175
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:36,080
伊芙琳  你不想和我们一起去购物吗
Evelyn, you don't want to go shopping with us?

176
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,210
这是在度假  宝贝
It's a vacation, sugar bear.

177
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,380
我们就该像被丢掉的拖鞋一样躺在沙滩上
We should be lying on the beach like a lost flip-flop.

178
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,720
但是亲爱的  在沙滩上除了喝酒无事可做
But, darling, there's nothing to do at the beach except drink.

179
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,140
这样吧  你们两个去逛逛
You know what? Why don't you two take in the sights

180
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,360
我带着你的南部情人去沙滩上
while I chaperone your Southern señorita to the beach?

181
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,170
天啊  真是个优雅的解决方案
Well, my, my, what an elegant solution.

182
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,440
我猜这样所有人都能开心了
Well, I guess this way everyone's happy.

183
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,040
今晚的晚餐棒极了  各位
Tonight's dinner is amazing, folks:

184
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,260
钓到的鲯鳅
line-caught mahi mahi.

185
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,790
当地的渔民都是子承父业
The local fishermen pass the lines down from father to son,

186
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,460
所以你能体会到家族的传承
so, boy, you can taste the heritage.

187
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,630
我的老天
Dios mío!

188
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,140
怎么了
Eh, what?

189
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,710
大家好啊
Oh. Hey, guys.

190
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,430
我们在海滩碰到了这群超棒的猴子
We met these awesome monkeys on the beach,

191
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,110
我们说了只要它们足够搞笑
and we said they could crash here

192
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,840
就让它们暂住在这儿
in exchange for them being hilarious.

193
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,060
亲爱的  你都没告诉我
Sweetie, you did not tell me

194
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,490
你的妹夫是个这么有趣的人
your brother-in-law was such a fun guy.

195
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,460
你们俩应该开心才是
You two should be so happy.

196
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:45,860
你老公和你女朋友是好朋友
Your husband and your girlfriend are amigos!

197
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,690
你和谁在一起呢  金宝
Who's that with you, Jimbo?

198
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,490
那是史黛西吗
Is that Stacy?

199
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,340
天哪
Oh, my God.

200
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,570
金宝出轨了
Jimbo is cheating on me!

201
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,030
什么
Wha...?

202
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,940
好了  化妆套装  自拍杆
Ok. Make-up kit. Selfie stick.

203
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,210
老天  自拍杆充电器去哪了
Oh, God, where's the selfie stick charger?

204
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,350
亲爱的  没事
Honey, relax.

205
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,900
瀑布的照片肯定会不错的
The waterfall picture's going to be fine.

206
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,700
还不错  如果照片只是"不错"
Fine? If this photo is just "Fine,"

207
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,330
我们就离婚吧
we're getting a divorce.

208
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,820
好吧  好吧  这话过分了
Okay, okay, that crossed the line,

209
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,080
不过这是一生中仅此一次的旅行
but this is a once-in-a-lifetime trip

210
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,490
也是我们唯一记录完美瞬间的照片
and our only shot at a perfect moment.

211
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,550
我懂了  你是在为猴子派对的事情生气
I get it-- you're mad about my awesome monkey party.

212
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,100
但是你希望我对帕蒂的女朋友友善一点
But you wanted me to be nice to Patty's girlfriend,

213
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,140
而且你知道吗  她人很好
and guess what. She's cool.

214
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,900
正是你想要的  又一个酒友
Just what you need, another drinking buddy.

215
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:37,220
向我保证接下来的旅行你会规矩点就行了
Just promise me you'll behave for the rest of the trip.

216
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,610
好吧  好吧  我会离帕蒂那个
Okay, okay. I will stay far away

217
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,840
有趣的南方女朋友远远的
from Patty's fun Southern girlfriend.

218
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,990
或者就像她所说的
Or as she would say,

219
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,570
"比一个满脸肉的胖小子
"Further away than a fat-cheeked boy

220
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,710
离一走廊的老太婆还要远"
from a porch full of grannies."

221
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,640
快跑  胖小子  快跑
Run, fat boy, run!

222
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,540
你怎么这么紧张
Why are you freaking out?

223
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,670
你不是应该在丛林里亲吻大蟒蛇什么的吗
Shouldn't you be in the jungle kissing a boa constrictor or something?

224
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:05,790
这趟旅行太昂贵了  可爸妈压根不在乎
This trip is so expensive, and Mom and Dad don't care,

225
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,480
所以我在练习在车里睡觉
so I'm practicing sleeping in a car

226
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,890
为的是我们没房子住之后得睡在车里
for when we lose the house and have to sleep in our car!

227
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,500
苗浩斯的爸爸在他那本账本上
Well, Milhouse's dad writes down

228
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,600
记下了每个人欠他多少钱
how much money everyone owes in that book,

229
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,130
所以我们把那账本弄到手就行了
so all we have to do is snag it,

230
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,690
然后给爸妈看看他们欠了多少
then show Mom and Dad the numbers.

231
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:21,060
没错  让他们从金钱的疯狂中清醒过来
Yes! That'll snap 'em out of their financial insanity.

232
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,780
你准备好搞点小破坏和小入侵了吗
You up for a little breaking and entering?

233
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,110
入侵大人的卧室吗
Break into a grown-up's bedroom?

234
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,330
这可是大动作
Whoa, big move.

235
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,190
好吧  等大家去爬山的时候我们就动手
Okay, we'll do it when everyone's on the hike.

236
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,220
但是我们要怎么摆脱苗浩斯呢
But how do we get rid of Milhouse?

237
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,370
别担心  苗浩斯已经跟我绝交
Not a problem. Milhouse already ditched me

238
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,810
转头缠上希伯特医生的孩子了
for Dr. Hibbert's kid.

239
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,960
他的"度假伙伴"
His "Vacation friend."

240
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,140
JJ  你还喜欢玩乐高吗
Hey, JJ, do you still like Legos?

241
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,900
-不太喜欢了  -我也不喜欢
- Uh... not really. - Me neither.

242
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,680
乐高太差劲了
Lego sucks!

243
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,870
JJ  要不我们今晚给大人表演吧
Hey, JJ, why don't we put on a play for the grown-ups tonight?

244
00:10:54,650 --> 00:11:01,080
{\an8}哥斯达黎加的花

245
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:57,560
宝贝  你看  有个"哥斯达黎加的花"寻宝游戏
Ooh, sweetie, look, a "Flowers of Costa Rica" scavenger hunt.

246
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,120
我们一起能找到多少个呢
I wonder how many we can find together?

247
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,980
快点编  爸爸
Just braid, Daddy!

248
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,130
我得看起来超级性感才能赢回金宝的心
I need to look super hot to win back Jimbo's heart.

249
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,500
亲爱的  很多情感你都是第一次经历
Darling, you're experiencing so many emotions for the first time.

250
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,510
这很好  但是...
And that's very healthy, but...

251
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,930
他是因为你才搞外遇的
He strayed because of you!

252
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:18,990
JJ  有一次我朋友弄了个临时的纹身
Hey, JJ, one time my friend got a temporary tattoo

253
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,440
但跟他爸爸说是真的
but told his dad it was real.

254
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,620
好了  我们去偷账本吧
Okay, let's steal that ledger.

255
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,790
那是什么
What's that thing?

256
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,800
用帕蒂带钢圈的内衣做的抓升钩
Grappling hook made of Patty's underwire bra

257
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,560
还有爸爸浴袍的腰带
and Dad's bathing suit drawstring.

258
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,910
够得着吗
Will it reach?

259
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:44,370
在别的大人的卧室里待着感觉好奇怪
This is so weird, being in another grown-up's bedroom.

260
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:48,700
{\an8}最强肌肉  猩猩泵感
猛兽臀肌  亢奋血管

261
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,340
{\an8}我的孩子  我的废物
学着去爱一个让你失望的人

262
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,840
{\an8}超强利帕
强效口唇疱疹乳膏
强力配方

263
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,730
老天  我正想说  他压根都不健身
Boy, you're telling me. He doesn't even work out.

264
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:52,460
我不想知道关于这家人的任何事了
Uh, I don't want to learn anything else about this family.

265
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,020
太迟了
It's too late.

266
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,420
好了  喝口水休息一下
All right, bottled water break.

267
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,190
我可以喝点溪水
I can drink from the stream.

268
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:05,300
经过这么多年  我肠胃的生物群落
After all these years, my gut biome is simpatico

269
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,220
已经和这里的细菌和谐共处了
with the local bacteria.

270
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,420
老天爷  有东西在我肚子里动
Ugh! Oh, God, there's something moving inside me!

271
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,570
让开  快让开
Oh, look out! Oh, look out!

272
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,250
快让开  我说了让开
Look out, I said look out! Look out!

273
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:22,400
不和睦  一点也不和睦
Oh, God, no simpatico! No simpatico!

274
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,660
侯默  想来一口吗
Hey, Homer. You want a hit off this?

275
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:29,470
伊芙琳  我们都爱在白天偷偷喝酒
Oh, Evelyn. You and I both love secret day drinking,

276
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,700
但我已经答应马姬在剩下的日子里
but I promised Marge I'd have a bad time

277
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,420
都要玩得不开心
the rest of this vacation.

278
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,400
我完全懂
I hear exactly what you're saying.

279
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,630
你找到账本了吗
Did you find the ledger?

280
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,560
没  但快看这个
No, but take a look at this.

281
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,720
这是已经灭绝的
These are stone spheres

282
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,450
哥斯达黎加迪奎斯人做的石球
made by the extinct Diquis people of Costa Rica.

283
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:58,370
没人知道它们的用处  但它们价值连城
No one knows what they were for, but they're priceless artifacts.

284
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,620
为什么苗浩斯的废柴爸爸有这些
So what is Milhouse's loser dad doing with them?

285
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,250
我对不起你  小肚肚
Oh, I'm sorry, Kirk's tum-tum.

286
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,020
爸比喝了些恶心水水
Daddy drank some ick-ick.

287
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,130
要开始咕咕叫了
Oh, the rumblies are coming.

288
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,660
要开始咕咕叫了
The rumblies are coming!

289
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,560
来了
They're here!

290
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,420
如果这张照片拍得好
If we get this photo right,

291
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:26,390
这次多家庭旅行花的每一分钱都值了
this multi-family vacation will be worth every penny.

292
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,910
你控制欲爆表的样子真可爱
You're so cute when you're super controlling.

293
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,280
你喝酒了
You've been drinking.

294
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,460
说不定是伊芙琳在我的水里
Well, maybe Evelyn added

295
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,270
加了点南方风情的迷人液体
a little Southern charm to my water.

296
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,100
那个女人  她完全激发了你最坏的一面
That woman! She brings out the worst in you!

297
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,650
快看
Look!

298
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,240
天呐
Oh, my God.

299
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,670
太完美了
It's perfect.

300
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,640
你看起来很好  我看起来更好
You look good, and I look better.

301
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,700
快发  快发
Post it. Post it.

302
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,330
侯默
Homer!

303
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,090
兄弟  快看我做萨凡纳臭鼬翻滚
Buddy, hi. Watch me do a Savannah Polecat Flip.

304
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,000
不
No!

305
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,020
快回来  你这条吃相机的鱼
Come back, camera fish!

306
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:17,550
我只想要朋友们嫉妒我
All I wanted was for my friends to be jealous of me.

307
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,190
希望你现在满意了
I hope you're happy

308
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:22,160
你们家的秃头猩猩成功把我家女友拉低到了
now that that bald gorilla has dragged my girlfriend down

309
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,620
他的悲惨水准
to his pathetic level.

310
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,570
帕翠西娅·玛丽菲森·布伟业
Patricia Maleficent Bouvier,

311
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,550
你批评我丈夫这么多年  我都忍了
I've put up with you criticizing my husband for years,

312
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,900
现在我受够了
and I've had it.

313
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,420
伊芙琳灌醉了侯默
Evelyn got Homer drunk.

314
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,520
伊芙琳毁了我的梦想照片
Evelyn ruined my dream photo.

315
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,440
她才是负面影响
She's the bad influence.

316
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,050
胡说八道
That's ridiculous.

317
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,950
她也许是南方人  也许是女的
She may be Southern, she may be a woman,

318
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,580
但是承认吧  你的对象是个侯默
but you're dating a Homer.

319
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,100
完了个蛋
Oh, no.

320
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,420
妈  快看我在范浩腾的房间里发现的
Mom, look what I found in the Van Houtens' room!

321
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:59,420
他们在走私古代文物回国然后出售
They are smuggling these artifacts home to sell!

322
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,760
这就是为什么他们有钱来旅游
That's how they can afford this vacation.

323
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,160
但我们没这么多钱
But we can't.

324
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,970
我们将不得不住在车里
And we're gonna have to live in our car,

325
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:08,340
可是我们的汽车座椅黏糊糊的
and the seats in our car are sticky,

326
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,080
尽管是布做的
even though they're cloth!

327
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,340
你  你好恶心
You're... you're so gross.

328
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,790
太恶心了
It's so gross.

329
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,180
盐  以及胡椒粉
Salt... and pepper.

330
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,180
这些本来该是
These souvenirs were supposed to be

331
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:23,590
旅行结束之后给你们的纪念品
our end-of-multi-family-vacation gift to you all.

332
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,780
惊喜都毁完了
Way to spoil the surprise.

333
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,690
不"纯生"
Not very pura vida.

334
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,950
太不"纯生"了
Not very pura vida at all.

335
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,560
我已经和史黛西拜拜了
Stacy and I are finished.

336
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,510
肖娜·丘墨士  你愿意嫁给我吗
Shauna Chalmers, will you marry me?

337
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,820
天呐
Oh, my God!

338
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,450
金宝求婚了
Jimbo proposed!

339
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:43,990
我们他妈的要结婚了
We are getting freaking married!

340
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,050
你们倒是急着要走
Ooh, You guys are sneaking off early.

341
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:55,780
不考虑一起高空滑索  再多搞些破坏吗
Don't you want to come ziplining and ruin the trip some more?

342
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,090
我同意
Well, I would...

343
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,740
我老婆的意见  我们离开比较好
like to agree with my wife that it's better we leave.

344
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,640
我把账单给你  把钱算清
I'll give you the final bill now so we can settle up.

345
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,980
早退也不会打折
No discount for leaving early either.

346
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:10,550
我虽然信仰"纯粹的生活"  但也不傻
I may be mucho pura vida, but, uh, I'm not a sucker.

347
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,620
丽莎是对的
Lisa was right.

348
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,950
我们真的付不起
We really couldn't afford this trip.

349
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,560
真是一笔巨款
Ooh, that's a big number.

350
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,770
帕蒂怎么样了  一直都没看见她
How's Patty? I haven't seen her.

351
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,000
我不知道发生了什么
I don't know what happened.

352
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,890
她和我分手了
She... broke up with me.

353
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,450
妈  我知道你感觉不好
I know you feel bad, Mom,

354
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,670
但那位女士可是个侯默
but the lady is a Homer.

355
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,210
这么多钱
Oh, all that money,

356
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,280
我们甚至连照片都没照到
and we didn't even get the picture.

357
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,200
看看这个
Look at this.

358
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,480
范浩腾先生甚至收了盐罐
Mr. Van Houten even charged us

359
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,050
和胡椒罐的钱
for those salt and pepper shakers.

360
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,950
他之前说是给我们的礼物
He said those were a gift.

361
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,010
然后甚至都没有赠与这个动作
And he didn't even give them to us.

362
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,160
那没有拿到礼物我们是不会走的
Then we're not leaving without them.

363
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:21,210
这就解释清楚了
Oh, so that explains it.

364
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,120
找到你了
Gotcha.

365
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,150
你甚至不能让我们安静地玩个索道吗
Can't you let us even zipline in peace?

366
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,060
看看我们找到了你卧室里藏的什么宝贝
Look what we found hidden in your bedroom.

367
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,900
是探索者柯克艾德莫斯·范浩腾的画像
This is a portrait of explorer Kirkedemious Van Houten,

368
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,560
为一家荷兰饼干贸易公司平定了此地
who settled this area for a Dutch cracker-trading company,

369
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:45,350
他建造了这幢房子  现在还是你家的财产
and he built this house, which your family still owns.

370
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,880
你明明是免费得到的房子  却要让我们
You're charging us thousands of dollars in rent

371
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,040
付出上万元的租金
for a house you get for free.

372
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,130
范浩腾家欺骗了所有人
The Van Houtens are cheating all of us,

373
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:55,180
我们成了他们出去度假的经济基础
so we pay for their vacation.

374
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,620
-我很震惊  -我大吃一鲸
- I'm stunned. - I'm shocked.

375
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,800
我是肖娜
I'm Shauna.

376
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,180
我跟你们一样震惊
I'm just as surprised as any of you.

377
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,310
什么  拜托
Oh, what?! Come on!

378
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,340
这个骗局就是她的主意
This scam was her idea.

379
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:09,220
这一年她甚至变本加厉收钱
And this year she even charged you more

380
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,470
这样我们才能付得起"亲密教练"的钱
so we could pay for our "Intimacy coach."

381
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:14,430
一根羽毛到底能做多少事情呢
I mean, how many things can you do with a feather?

382
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,310
别着急  各位  别着急
Oh, easy, guys, easy.

383
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,950
大家都想保持纯粹的生活  对吧
Everyone try to remain pura vida. Huh?

384
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,430
如果你不还钱的话  我他妈要纯粹地
I'm gonna pura vida my foot in your ass

385
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,150
用脚给你菊花来一记暴击
if you don't give me back my money.

386
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,770
他要跑了
He's zipping away!

387
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:31,060
在他提走支票的钱之前抓住他
Stop him before he endorses those checks!

388
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,230
所以你跟伊芙琳分手了吗
So, you and Evelyn broke up?

389
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,900
我以为你真的很喜欢她呢
I thought you really liked her.

390
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,880
的确  但是多亏了你  我一直看到侯默
I did, but now all I see is Homer, thanks to you.

391
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,180
帕蒂  回来
Patty! Come back!

392
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,520
我不能  因为我在索道上
I can't! Because I'm on a zipline...

393
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:51,040
帕蒂  很抱歉我让你不开心
Patty, I'm sorry I upset you,

394
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,130
但是伊芙琳就是你的侯默
but Evelyn is your Homer,

395
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,320
没有别人会明白你为何爱着她
and no one else will ever understand why you love her,

396
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,590
除了你自己
except for you.

397
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:00,420
但是二者之间又有很大的不同
But there's one huge difference between them.

398
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,040
继续说
I'm listening.

399
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,730
伊芙琳爱你
Evelyn loves you,

400
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,640
而侯默简直恨死你了
and Homer hates you more than anything in the world.

401
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,590
他恨我的程度超过塞尔玛吗
Even more than he hates Selma?

402
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,060
他为塞尔玛感到惋惜
He feels sorry for Selma,

403
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,310
因为她必须跟你一起生活
because she has to live with you.

404
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,210
等等  伊芙琳
Hold on, Evelyn!

405
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,800
我来了
I'm coming!

406
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,580
给给  拿走你的钱
Go ahead, take your money.

407
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,950
拿走一个男人唯一的经济来源
Take away a man's only source of income.

408
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,600
不  真的很高端
No, it's real classy.

409
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,510
我们刚刚享受了一次免费旅行
We just got a free vacation.

410
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,320
万岁
Hooray!

411
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:37,530
现在让我们租用直升机回瀑布那里吧
Now let's charter a helicopter back to the waterfall

412
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:40,160
去照你妈妈珍贵的照片
to get your mom's precious picture.

413
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,470
不不不  没关系
No, no, no. It's okay.

414
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:47,350
旅行的意义不在于完美的照片
Vacations aren't about the perfect photo.

415
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:51,180
而是要活在当下  自由自在
It's about being in the moment and living your... vida.

416
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:57,700
他们真像地毯里的虫子那样可爱
They're as cute as two bugs in a rug.

417
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,930
{\an8}巴仔恶魔

418
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,610
亲爱的  我只想让你知道
Honey, I just want you to know

419
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,760
金宝·琼斯是个很不错的年轻人
that Jimbo Jones is a fine young man,

420
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,570
我很乐见你们两个人结婚了
and I'm very happy for you two to be married.

421
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,720
-没错  -是的
- Truly. - Yeah...

422
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,890
金宝的父母惊慌失措取消了婚礼
Jimbo's parents freaked out and canceled the wedding.

423
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:22,960
无所谓
Whatever.

424
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,210
我很高兴有人设定了底线
I'm glad somebody's setting limits.

425
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,700
你知道  小可爱  我在尽力尝试
You know, pumpkin, I'm doing my best.

426
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,040
你明白吗
Do you understand that?

427
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,630
对于一个单身父亲来说  并不是那么容易
That as a single father, it's not always so easy

428
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,650
能够把指导和尊重平衡好
to balance guidance with respect for your...

429
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,310
是的
Yeah...

430
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,280
是的  现在我们有共鸣了  对吗
Yeah, now we're connecting, huh?

431
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,490
我们为什么不能走呢
Why can't we just leave?

432
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,480
因为我们得在彼得叔叔来之前打扫干净
'Cause we have to clean up before Uncle Pete gets here,

433
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,430
不然明年就不能来了
or we'll lose our week next year.

434
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,130
喂  这东西很贵的
Hey, hey, this stuff is expensive!

435
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,210
听到没
Comprende?

436
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,410
不行  朋友  不行
No, amigos, no, no.

437
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,330
不行  纯粹的生活
No, pura vida!

438
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,340
纯粹的生活
Pura vida!

439
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,230
不  不行
Oh, no! No bueno!
