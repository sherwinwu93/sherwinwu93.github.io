And now, to tell you what you're gonna do.

467
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,030
杀戮争霸  在线直播
Mortal Kombat: Live Online.

468
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,930
"杀戮"是"杀死"的意思吗
Doesn't "Mortal" Mean "Dead"?

469
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,310
可以是  但那是种修辞
Um, it can, but it's just a figure of speech.

470
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,250
所以我们不需要杀死彼此吗
So we don't kill each other?

471
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,980
杀死效果会更好
Oh, if you did, that would be great.

472
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,460
但随机行事吧
But let's play it by ear.

473
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,520
听着
Okay, guys,

474
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,880
打斗中
when you're in combat,

475
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,390
肯定会互相残杀
definitely killing each other,

476
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,590
重要的是要提到武器赞助商
it's important to feature your sponsored weapons.

477

巴仔  你提网飞
Bart, you're promoting Netflix.

478
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,270
明白吗  还有三叉戟口香糖
Got it? And Trident gum.

479
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:34,110
侯默  你代言利斧身体喷雾
Homer, you're repping Axe Body Spray

480
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,700
还有三叉戟薄荷口香糖
and Trident Spearmint gum.

481
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,800
懂了吗  侯默
Do you get it, Homer?

482
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,730
武器和商品对应
The product things match the words.

483
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,600
听起来很没劲
I don't know, this seems kind of lame.

484
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,810
知道什么有劲吗
You know what's not lame?

485
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,870
你杀了自己父亲时
An audience of 200 livestreams

486
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,510
那两百个直播流媒体量
while you kill your own father.

487
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,460
或者其他桥段  你俩掌握
Or whatever. Feel it out.

488
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,890
我糊涂了  我需要点其他灵感
I don't know, I'm gonna need some more inspiration.

489
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,600
天呐  是你吗
Oh, my God, is it really you?

490
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,660
是它
It is.

00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,820
无家可归的前葡萄藤的短视频博主们
and homeless former Viners,

494
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,060
他们在熊猫快餐互相攻击被大家喜爱
you loved them in their smackdown at Panda Express.

495
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,670
他们拥抱后大家都感到失望
Then they hugged and you were like, "What?"

496
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:17,180
他们就是侯默和巴仔·辛普森
Homer and Bart Simpson!

497
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,610
我闻到恐惧了吗
Do I smell fear?

498
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,300
我不怕你
I'm not afraid of you.

499

我不想和你战斗
I don't want to fight you.

506
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,680
我也是  儿子
Me, neither, son.

507
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:50,970
谁能想到不同世界的我们
Who'd have thought that two guys from such different worlds

508
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,930
竟能如此契合
could connect like us?

509
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,830

今日一问
Today's question:

516
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,900
体育谈话节目是在完全浪费时间吗
are sports talk shows a complete and utter waste of time?

517
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,700
接下来的五小时
We will get to the bottom of this

518
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,800
我们会仔细研究这个问题

五小时吗
Five hours?!

520

五小时内我怎么说得完

我的整个职业生涯都取决于我

从不会结束讨论

00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,030
因为我知道
