19
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,900
Come on, out of my way!

20
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,490
Where was this traffic when I was driving to church?

21
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,330
Homie, calm down.

22
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,520
We're not going to miss the San Castellaneta Festival.

23
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,680
I love San Castellaneta.

24
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,950
Delicious food, wonderful people.

25
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,780
It's just like being in Italy.

26
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,290
But with streets that are wide enough I can fit in them.

27
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,630
And I love the rides that are dangerous

28
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,410
because they're 100 years old.

36
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,610
Hold on, kids. Here we go.

37
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,660
I beat out a mule and an ox for this job.

38
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,130
The secret is not to ask for benefits.

39
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,760
*Give me pizza, give me pasta*

40
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,030
*Give me lots of cannoli*

41
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,110
*I'll drink sambuca till I puke-a*

42
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,930
*Then I'll finish with spumoni*

43
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,900
*Drink until my legs are Jell-O*

44
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,210
*Cheap red wine and limoncello*

45
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,400
You want us to bring you anything back

46
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,680
from the festival, Tone?

47
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,640
No. It's all carbs.

48
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,440
I don't want people to think I'm fat.

49
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,550
But your name is Fat Tony.

50
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,950
It blends.

51
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,760
I can't believe you're not going,

52
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,310
after I flew out your uncle from Sicily.

53
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,910
- Idiota! - That icy glare

54
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,110
is why I left the old country.

55
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,750
Tightlips, you do a poor job of reading my moods.

56
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,100
But you're the only one I trust.

57
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,180
Go. Enjoy your festival

58
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,730
while I sit here bonding with my uncle.

59
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,220
Do you want to go to the festival, Zio?

60
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,630
I came to this country for the Burning Man.

61
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,360
Before I die,

62
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:09,050
I want to see a naked crunchy chick riding a bicycle.

63
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,730
*Everybody has a treat*

65
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,220
- Opa! - That's Greek, Chief.

66
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,050
Hey, Lou, when's the festival for Saint Know-It-All?

67
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,300
- Uh, I believe it's October the... - There isn't one!

68
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,670
Nobody likes a know-it-all. Idiot.

69
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,130
Hey, we got a-zeppole, we got a-braciole,

70
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,910
capicola, scungilli,

71
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,390
and I don't know what the hell-a this is.

72
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,510
Can you make it all in one thing and fry it?

73
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,700
I saw-a you coming.

74
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,980
Ooh. This place looks interesting.

75
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,460
Dad, no, that's an actual church.

78
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,570
Welcome, everyone, to this festival

79
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,540
that does not celebrate Christopher Columbus.

80
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,600
repeat: not Columbus.

81
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,730
As we stand here at the corner

82
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,750
of Niña and Pinta and Santa Maria,

83
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,870
let us welcome your master of cere-spumonies,

84
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,780
Aquaman himself,

85
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,070
Jason Morororora.

86
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,310
It is an honor to be here on land today

87
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,650
to recount the inspiring story of this great saint.

88
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,810
- Aquaman. - Sign my left boob.

90
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,010
Aquaman is not here for the signing of boobs.

91
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,290
That's a separate event at the Marriott. Conference room C.

92
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,710
In 250 A.D., Brother Ignatius Castellaneta

93
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,770
refused to recant his Christian faith.

94
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,980
And so the Romans chopped off his head,

95
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,270
they chopped off his arms,

96
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:38,720
they chopped off his legs, and they chopped off his toes.

97
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,140
They shot him with arrows made of frozen snakes

98
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,180
and they pulled out his eyes and replaced them

99
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,030
with chocolate-covered pistachios.

100
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,590
But still, Ignatius refused to recant.

101
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,530
So they boiled his bones in sparkling cherry wine.

102
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,970
So that's why the thrice-martyred saint

103
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,370
is remembered with spumoni,

104
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,980
the chocolate pistachio cherry ice cream treat.

105
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,710
Ugh. Not good.

106
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,280
Uh, yes, uh, thank you, Super-Fish.

107
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,590
And now, let us show our deep reverence for Jesus

108
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,740
by festooning his statue with dollar bills.

109
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,170
Pin a dollar on Jesus, Homer.

110
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,730
He doesn't need money.

111
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,440
I hear his father's loaded.

112
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,260
Hey, where's my wallet?

113
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,800
Yeah, my wallet's gone, too.

114
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,720
- My purse! - My belt!

115
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,270
My clutch!

116
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,290
We are the victims of a pocket-picking pandemic.

117
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,680
Do something, Wet Panther!

118
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,720
Peter Piper picked a peck of pocket wallets?

120
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,510
How many paupers did Peter's pocket picking produce?

121
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,740
I'm afraid no pants are safe from this Dockers stalker,

122
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,640
this chino bandito, this trouser browser.

123
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,440
But Chief Wiggum vows he will solve this pickle of a puzzle.

124
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,510
Oh, I solved it, all right.

126
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,920
"Thief of polite." "Thief of polite."

127
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,970
I said it first!

128
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:09,460
Wiggum, I hate to interrupt this important police work...

129
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,420
"Police." That's it. "Thief of police."

130
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,780
Hey! I need that to switch to Access Hollywood.

131
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,680
You need a lot more than that.

132
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,520
I'm Lenora Carter,

133
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:21,910
special investigator from the attorney general's office,

134
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,950
and I'm taking over this case.

135
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,080
Uh, look, ma'am, you seem nice,

136
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:28,790
but no one comes into my precinct and tells me what to do.

137
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,750
- Shut up and listen. - Yes, ma'am.

138
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,850
You are the worst police officer I've ever had the pleasure

139
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,890
of humiliating in front of his men.

140
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,380
You are so fat, you're good cop and bad cop.

141
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,920
Your drug-sniffing dog is in rehab.

142
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,600
Okay, it's for sex addiction.

144
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,870
You there! Riggs and Murtaugh.

145
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,880
It's time to do some real police work.

146
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,640
I see, fine. No, go ahead.

147
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,210
I'll go work out my feelings on the gun range.

148
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,940
We don't have a gun range!

150
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:05,360
We'll trap the pickpocket by planting a wallet with a tracer

151
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,560
in a rear end so huge, no criminal could miss it.

152
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,490
- We need to find the biggest ass in town. - Hello.

153
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,270
Could you direct me to the Office of Park Bench Removal?

154
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,270
Yeah, just take a seat, sir.

155
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,640
Thank you, I have my own.

156
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,940
I'm not letting my husband risk his life.

157
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,920
I admit it, I'm scared.

158
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,860
Ma'am, this is a matter of public urgency.

159
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,300
Your husband's rear end is bigger than the both of us.

160
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,940
With your kids' permission,

161
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,520
we can watch your father's butt crack this case wide open.

162
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,720
"Wide open."

163
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,910
Homer, we're placing this tracking device in your wallet.

164
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,820
Then you just have to put that sweet seat meat on the street.

165
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,080
Now let me pull your wallet up

166
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,090
so it's just peeking over the pocket.

167
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,570
Uhp-bup-bup. Allow me.

168
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,250
Pick a card. Any card.

169
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,970
Thank God that thing is on our side.

171
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,080
We've got our target.

172
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,850
What are you doing here?

173
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,060
I admit it,

174
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,240
I couldn't stay away. I was following you.

175
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:46,050
Also, I was driving around to put Ralphie to sleep.

176
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,810
That kid will not go down.

177
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:51,210
I'm a lotto ball. You lose again, Daddy.

178
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,380
We're going in.

179
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,870
Ah-ah-ah. Except you.

180
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,860
Ah, you work with two guys all your life

181
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,050
and you think you know 'em.

182
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,860
Betrayed by Lou and, uh, the other guy.

183
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,020
What is his name again?

184
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,960
I-I want to say Greg.

185
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:21,080
You know, Uncle, guests, like fish, stink after three days.

186
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,210
I told you once, I told you a thousand times,

187
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:27,150
I'm not leaving until my wife forgives me.

188
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,350
- She's dead. - You always take her side!

189
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,740
Cops? What are you doing here?

190
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,530
This is a setup. W-What are these things?

191
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:38,570
I was told this was an Asian fusion pop-up restaurant,

192
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:41,320
but I see no Asian nor fusion.

193
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,490
Marion "Fat Tony" D'Amico,

194
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,350
you're under arrest for heading a pickpocket ring.

195
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:49,090
But I've never seen these wallets before.

196
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,540
The-the room is spinning.

197
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,540
So this is what it feels like to be innocent.

198
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,210
And this is how it feels to be irrelevant.

199
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,170
Daddy's an elephant.

200
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,420
No-no, I'm not an elephant, Ralphie,

201
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,340
and-and please don't you forget it.

203
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,110
The Wolf of Wallet Street?

204
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,890
Reputed mobster

205
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:29,600
Fat Tony D'Amico is at last behind bars.

206
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,240
My wife.

207
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,250
My goomar.

208
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,370
My teacup pig.

210
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,650
What's wrong, Chief?

211
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,420
Marge, you ever felt like life has passed you by,

212
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,670
there's no point?

213
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,810
Oh, you're just having a rough patch.

214
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,160
It happens to all men in their 50s.

215
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,710
I'm 38, Marge.

216
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,720
Chief, do you know why I love my husband?

217
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,870
For that most romantic of reasons: inertia.

218
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,860
I love him because he's not afraid to fail.

219
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,600
He has boundless unjustified confidence, and you should, too.

220
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,250
Really? You think so?

221
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,140
Boy, suddenly, I-I see a break in the clouds.

222
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,180
I will not let you down, Marge.

223
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,430
Uh, Marge, can I get a ride to the station?

224
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,160
Uh, Ralphie will stay with the car.

227
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,420
Dear Lord, who sees all, the jabronis and the mamalukes,

228
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,030
you know I am innocent.

229
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,550
In your mercy and by your grace,

230
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:45,050
help me kneecap the rat Judas who set me up.

231
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,320
Amen.

232
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,020
Almighty God, I'm not a praying man.

233
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,500
For me, getting down on my knees is often a one-way trip.

234
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,100
I-I know I made a deal with the devil to be chief,

235
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,450
but please just ignore that and help me out, will ya?

236
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:10,810
Dear Lord, please bring back plastic straws.

237
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:13,680
The paper ones get soggy so fast.

239
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,000
I brought the mob lawyer right away

240
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,430
like you asked, boss.

241
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,330
They wouldn't even let me put my pants on.

242
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,530
I was barely able to grab my rate clock.

243
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,970
Al diavolo rate clock. Get me out of here.

244
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,670
- And I mean fast. - Patience. Patience.

245
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,570
Okay, what have they got you on?

246
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,150
Murder one

247
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:35,240
Murder two?

248
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,640
Pickpocketing! Quit talking slow!

249
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,830
All right.

250
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,960
Actually, I'm innocent.

251
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,050
Innocent?! Innocent?!

252
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:47,200
A judge wouldn't believe you for a second.

253
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,480
I've got nothing to work with here.

254
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,990
What would you even plead? You really did it this time.

255
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,610
I didn't do it.

256
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,800
You want me to whack him, boss?

257
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,410
No! Just usher him out.

258
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,180
Got it. I'll "usher him out."

259
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,140
I mean show him the door.

260
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,920
Right. I'll "show him the door."

261
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,960
Whatever you think I want you to do, just do the opposite!

266
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,740
The one crime I would never commit is pickpocketing.

267
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,230
Huh. He seems sincere.

268
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,190
I am sincere.

269
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:45,970
When I was a boy, my father, Fatso Antonio,

270
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,720
needed a heart transplant.

271
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:51,680
On its way to the hospital, that heart was pickpocketed.

272
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,140
My father died the way no made man should die:

273
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,970
of natural causes.

274
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,050
Oh, my God. I discovered a clue.

275
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,010
I found an electric toothbrush.

276
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,840
Well, he'll sleep good tonight.

277
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,820
I can tell he's innocent,

278
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,120
with a certainty you can only develop

279
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,970
putting hundreds of innocent people in jail.

281
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,430
DNA technology has not been my friend.

284
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:23,630
Lights out!

285
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,510
Psst. Psst, psst.

286
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,490
Why do you "Psst" Me? I'm not going anywhere.

287
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:29,920
I think you're innocent.

288
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,650
But you're gonna have to convince me

289
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:34,600
to ignore your entire past history.

290
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,790
I was not born a rich man.

291
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:44,410
Where I grew up, there was one way out: your fists.

292
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,530
Or the many scholarships available

293
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:49,080
to young Italian-American students.

294
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,020
But the forms required information,

295
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,040
and I ain't no snitch.

296
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,470
All right, I'm losing my confidence.

297
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,780
You did it, didn't you?

298
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:59,440
I swear on this former priest that I didn't do it.

299
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,350
He's not guilty.

300
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:04,340
- And I know guilty. - And I can prove it.

301
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,430
- Well, go ahead. - I said I can prove it.

302
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,590
I didn't say I would.

303
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,300
Well, why wouldn't you?

304
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:14,550
Because what I was actually doing at the time is something

305
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:18,090
a mob boss cannot do and let people know.

306
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,890
If you help me, I swear an oath

307
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:22,070
we'll find the guy that framed you.

308
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,080
All right, I will show you what I was doing

309
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,850
when the heist went down.

310
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,010
It's so embarrassing, it has to be true.

311
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,540
Give me your phone.

313
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,310
This is what I do every day at that time,

314
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,860
the time of the crime.

315
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,990
As you will see, I walk into my private space,

316
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,450
I gargle,

317
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,140
and then, God help me, I...

318
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,850
*Good times and bum times*

319
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,680
*I've seen them all and, my dear*

320
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,680
*I'm still here*

321
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,780
*Plush velvet sometimes*

322
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,620
*Sometimes just pretzels and beer*

323
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,960
*But I'm here... *

324
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,920
Now you know. When I'm alone, I sing show tunes.

325
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,050
You didn't steal those wallets. You stole my heart.

326
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,160
Leave it on.

327
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,470
*Ten years a mob boss, hits and whacks *

328
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:25,540
*Bought judges and mayors, and never paid tax*

329
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,080
Okay, that's enough.

330
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,620
Definitely enough.

333
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,700
We're gonna get you out today.

334
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,490
Appreciate the offer, Chief,

335
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,320
but prison has changed me.

336
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:44,130
Now I'm thinking I should just give up, serve out my term,

337
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:47,620
then sit in the warm sun outside the butcher shop.

338
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,190
Isn't that what you always did?

339
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,470
Yeah, but every few hours,

340
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,750
someone would whisper something into my ear,

341
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,190
then I had to decide whether to nod or shrug.

342
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,610
It was very stressful. The agita.

343
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,710
Uh, I thought you wanted to get the guy who put you here.

344
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,860
I do.

345
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,900
Well, we will, if you will wear a wire.

346
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,490
I'm sorry, but on principle, that is something I cannot do.

347
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:16,380
Let me repeat: something I cannot do.

353
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,260
Now, remember the phrase to call for help.

354
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,430
- What phrase? - "Remember the phrase."

355
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,180
I will. What phrase is it?

356
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,390
"Remember the phrase."

357
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:52,720
I would if you would tell me what it is.

358
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,870
The phrase is "remember the phrase."

359
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:57,570
That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

360
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,730
Just remember, your life depends on us.

361
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,300
Oh, and please, no profanity.

362
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,970
I play these for the missus

363
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,500
when we're, uh, we're getting in the mood.

364
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,870
A toast to Fat Tony, a man like a Botticelli nude

365
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,190
fat, old and easy to frame, huh?

366
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,970
Hello, fellas.

367
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,280
Fat Tony. I was just saying how much we missed you.

368
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,470
Huh? Huh, guys?

369
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,820
- Oh, yeah, sure. - Yeah, we said that.

370
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,710
Quiet! I don't want to hear anybody

371
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,700
but Frankie the Squealer.

372
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,250
W-W-What do, w-what do you want to hear from me?

373
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,540
The name of the man who framed you? I would never.

374
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,230
I didn't say Johnny Tightlips.

375
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,970
I would never say Johnny Tightlips.

376
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:43,560
Ladies and gentlemen, our new boss, Johnny Tightlips.

377
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,760
So, it was you, Johnny.

378
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:49,130
- What? Hey! Whoa! - You!

379
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,780
After all your passive-aggressive replies

380
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,320
and bitter looks, I never would've guessed.

381
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,290
You mistook my taciturn nature for fealty.

382
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,720
But it was simply that I didn't feel comfortable

383
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,450
in social situations.

384
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,020
Then I saw this commercial

385
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,480
where a sad cloud goes on a date with the sun.

386
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,210
So I talked to my doctor about Paxil,

387
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,430
and it gave me the confidence to betray you.

388
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,630
This is my crew now.

389
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,970
Ain't that right, Jimmy Kissass?

390
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,870
You was always my favorite.

391
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,910
What about you, Sonny Go-along?

392
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,970
I'm good if everyone else is.

393
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,050
- Willie Whatever? - Whatever.

394
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,510
And you, Joey Can't-Read-the-Room?

395
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,160
You're nuts! Ain't none of us gonna go along with this!

396
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,670
Yeah, see, that's-- you didn't-- that's not...

397
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,460
*Just a small town girl*

398
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,940
I'm surprised Maggie isn't here.

399
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,980
*Lonely world*

400
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,140
*She took the midnight train*

401
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,630
*Going anywhere*

402
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:00,380
Mmm, this pasta's delicious.

403
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,280
I'm gonna find out what the sauce is.

404
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,190
Remember the phrase.

405
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,610
Remember what phrase?

406
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,380
Oh, right.

407
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,280
Ooh, sauce.

408
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,970
Oh! I'm hit!

409
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,870
Right in the heart... of your ass.

410
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,940
Someone's got to suck out the bullet.

411
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:29,190
Wiggum, damn it, this is what you were born to do.

412
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,130
*Don't stop*

413
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,220
There he is.

414
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,080
We thought we were gonna lose you for a minute there, champ.

415
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,800
You have the chief here to thank.

416
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,600
His quick suction may have saved your life.

417
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:46,580
Thank you.

419
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,590
Well, Wiggum, I have to say, when I first met you,

420
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,800
I thought you were totally incompetent.

421
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:58,890
And?

422
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,780
And?

423
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,890
And?! A-And?! And?!

424
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,840
I believe in you, Chief.

425
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,860
And, yeah, that-that's enough.

427
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,000
The three of us. We are not that different.

428
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,670
Whoa! Hey, whoa!

429
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,420
What's this guy talking about?

430
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,450
We are cicciobomba,

431
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:25,250
who like to sit in the sun and enjoy a nice prosciutto.

432
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,780
Cicciobomba, prosciutto.

433
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,190
You guys make garbage sound good.

434
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,590
We call garbage spazzatura.

435
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,140
Mmm... garbage.

436
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,630
Garbage.
