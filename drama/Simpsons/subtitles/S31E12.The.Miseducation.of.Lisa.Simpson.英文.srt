18
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,750
Guten Abend, Herr Horatio.

19
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,690
Gib mir die Karte.

22
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,100
Springfield, eh?

23
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,310
Then that's where I'm going treasure hunting.

24
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,630
You mean we're going treasure hunting.

25
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,550
We'll find that sunken ship within the week.

26
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,200
Grid 274 by 319.

28
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,180
Depth 60 meters. Sounding.

29
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:58,830
Nothing.

30
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,480
Proceed to next reading.

31
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,880
Grid 274 by 320.

32
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,160
Depth 60 meters. Sounding.

33
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,160
Nothing.

34
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,830
Captain, the long-range Doppler shows a squall

35
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,520
coming out of the nor'east.

36
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,690
We'd best head back to wait it out.

37
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:49,240
Let me guess, you didn't find any treasure today.

38
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,410
Did you talk to the doctor about going up on your dose?

39
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,390
The storm stirred up the seafloor.

40
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,920
We'll have to resound everything south of the break.

41
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,810
Grid 274 by 6.

42
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,220
Depth 30 meters. Sounding.

43
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,220
Nothing.

44
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,910
I made us a roast for dinner,

45
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,310
then threw it away.

46
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,900
I'm sorry I never gave you any children.

47
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,420
Grid 291 by 502.

48
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,820
Depth 70 meters. Sounding.

49
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,370
A second ping.

50
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,430
A second ping!

51
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,120
I've waited half a lifetime to say this.

52
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,040
Divers, gear up!

53
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,610
We found it.

54
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,740
We finally found it, boys!

55
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,890
I didn't waste my life!

57
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,280
I see you've come to admire our plunder.

58
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,090
technically that plunder belongs to the town.

59
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,220
It was discovered in Springfield city limits.

60
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,810
No, we found the gold in unincorporated waters!

61
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,970
The survey says it's ours!

62
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,210
Sorry, but the town redrew the boundaries...

64
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,310
yesterday.

65
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,480
But we worked in secret for 40 years.

66
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,470
I pretended to be a flimsy, one-note character.

67
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,180
How did you know?

68
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,520
I should have been your treasure.

70
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,670
All right, people. This town's got doubloons.

71
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,840
Who's got ideas?

72
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,960
If I don't hear anything good, we're building another stadium,

73
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,920
and no team will come here.

74
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,010
How about a new town clock where, every hour,

75
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,600
Jesus forgives the Devil?

76
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,680
A new zoo with more attractive animals.

77
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,270
What about those death panels we were promised?

79
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:11,060
Shouting out something before I know what I'm gonna say.

80
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,880
Rock & Roll Hall of Fame with no Pearl Jam!

81
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,320
Excuse me. I have an idea.

82
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,530
Now, Marge, if you'll check your program,

83
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:22,100
nagging objections are at the end.

85
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,580
Look at the world.

86
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,960
Our children's future is challenging and uncertain.

87
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,580
This windfall is our last, best hope

88
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:37,410
to give our kids the tools they'll need to face that future.

89
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,510
To succeed, our kids must have an education

90
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,540
based on science, technology,

91
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,040
engineering and math.

92
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,020
STEM.

93
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,520
All who find Marge's idea tiresome,

94
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,920
let out an exaggerated, sarcastic yawn.

95
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,530
Okay, okay. I brought someone

96
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,240
you will listen to about STEM education.

97
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,770
Columbia recording artist John Legend.

98
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:11,500
*STEM, science, tech, engineering and math*

99
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,710
*More than a trendy way to say computer class*

100
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,250
*STEM, it's not just for dorks, dweebs and nerds*

101
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,420
*It'll turn all your dumb kids to Zuckerbergs*

102
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:27,180
*STEM, 'cause the future is written in code*

103
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,600
*Make an app, get big cash from an IPO*

104
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,730
*STEM*

105
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:37,470
*Oh, STEM*

106
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,360
Who could say no to a silky slow jam

107
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,700
about the importance of technology-based learning?

108
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,410
I'll never have kids because my nards were cooked by science.

109
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,160
But if I could, I'd want 'em to learn

110
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,710
about the science of why they don't exist.

111
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,960
I'd just like to thank John Legend...'s wife

112
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,570
Chrissy Teigen for bringing him here today.

113
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,840
Turns out, there's nothing she loves more

114
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,380
than doing personal favors for her Instagram followers.

115
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,800
Well, Marge, you did call the picture I posted

116
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,850
of my kids with ketchup on their faces "adorbs."

117
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,600
It was. It was totes adorbs.

118
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,090
Baby, we got to get going.

119
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,520
We're gonna be late for the launch party for our couples' perfume.

120
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,820
I'm talking to my online friend IRL.

121
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,510
Go charge the kids' iPads.

122
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,990
Come on, Springfield!

123
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,650
Build your children the school of tomorrow.

124
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,880
I did it.

125
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,780
I gave our kids hope for the future.

126
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,140
You have any songs about

127
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,450
how I should be allowed to skip jury duty?

128
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,910
*How is it justice to impanel a man*

129
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,410
*During March Madness?*

131
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,560
What are you gonna do with your forced retirement, sir?

132
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,690
I'm intrigued by a local skydiving club

133
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,400
who needs someone to sit in the office and answer phones.

134
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,150
Yeah, well, who cares?

135
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,030
I'll be taking an Ohio River cruise.

136
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,410
Lot of widows on the Good River.

137
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,940
Lot of widows.

138
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:16,870
New school smell.

139
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,170
Paperless classrooms, personal tablets,

140
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,490
and uncrammable lockers.

141
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,570
Man, this is embarrassing.

143
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,930
Bart Simpson.

144
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:37,060
Welcome. I'm Zane Furlong, this school's CEO:

145
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,230
Collaborative Educational Outreacher.

146
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,480
I'm gonna stop you right there, Skinner 2.0.

147
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,480
It doesn't matter how you dress it up.

148
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,530
All schools are kid prisons.

149
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,200
Well, I'm putting you in solitary,

150
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,220
where you'll learn geometry by shooting meteors.

151
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:52,200
Shoot enough,

152
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,440
and you'll unlock customizable skins.

153
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,250
Skins?

154
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,230
That's how boys play dress-up.

155
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,340
Lisa Simpson.

156
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,260
Our educational metric has identified you

157
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,760
as a divergent multipathway assimilator.

158
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,390
You mean, I'm in a gifted class?

159
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,710
Ooh, we don't like that term.

160
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,680
Everyone is gifted.

161
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,390
I firmly believe that.

162
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,400
Now go upstairs to the...

163
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,880
gifted class.

164
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,980
Finally, I feel seen.

165
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,820
And for the first time, I'll be accepted by my peers

166
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,430
with open arms.

167
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,560
I'm home.

168
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,250
Okay, gifted class.

169
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,490
Recess is over.

170
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,880
Now, this school is so advanced

172
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,140
that every aspect of it is run by an algorithm.

173
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,160
Who can give me an example of an algorithm?

174
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,520
Like when you buy a new garbage can online

175
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,560
and the rest of your life, you see ads for garbage cans.

176
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,150
Or like when you watch a bunch of close-up magic videos on YouTube

177
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:09,280
and get ads for a suicide hotline.

178
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,490
Exactly.

179
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,570
And because you liked this lesson,

180
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:15,270
the algorithm thinks you might also enjoy...

183
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,920
How was your first day at the new STEM school I founded?

184
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,000
It was amazing. We did science,

185
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,590
then we did computer science,

186
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,010
and then we did cognitive computer science.

187
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,340
Oh, what a surprise. Lisa likes school.

188
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,350
All right, boy. What did you get suspended for today?

189
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,330
Nothing.

190
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,770
I like this school, too.

191
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,940
Instead of teachers giving us letter grades,

192
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,480
an algorithm gives us stars.

194
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,110
Education is a game now, and I'm great at it.

195
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,190
Look at all these skins I've already unlocked.

196
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,430
Oh, that guy.

197
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,490
Noice.

198
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,030
I even unlocked the "Skin Unlocking" badge.

200
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,540
Tell us, what do you do, Mr. Simpson?

202
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,170
Ah, yes. I monitor the core temperature

203
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,710
at the nuclear power plant.

204
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,130
If it gets into the red,

205
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:12,010
I tell my family first so they can leave town

206
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,840
before the streets get too crowded.

207
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,620
Now, this is a great example...

208
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,220
...of the kind of job that will soon cease to exist.

209
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,970
What the words now?

210
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,390
Mr. Simpson's daily tasks

211
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,810
can be more efficiently performed by robots.

212
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,940
My guess is, his job will be obsolete in 18 months.

213
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,570
What about them? How much time do their careers have?

214
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,490
- I'm a librarian. - Five years.

215
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,450
I just bought a New York City taxi medallion.

216
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,530
Five years ago.

217
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:40,950
I do social media for a cannabis delivery company.

218
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,330
You'll be fine.

219
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:45,500
But all these other jobs will soon be made obsolete

220
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,120
by automation.

221
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,790
Oh, no. The robots are coming!

222
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,240
I've got to warn everyone!

223
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,070
Stupid kids!

225
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,060
I'm getting five stars in all my classes.

226
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,980
I finally unlocked dreadlock sideburns.

227
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,920
Someone's user name is moving up the leaderboard.

229
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,860
Now get back downstairs

230
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,840
to prepare for the jobs of tomorrow.

231
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,300
It's a race to the bottom!

233
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,660
Bart, I've never seen you so engaged in learning.

234
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,620
It's awesome. We're seeing how many e-scooters

235
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,920
we can collect around town,

236
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,750
charge, then get back on the streets.

237
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,050
Oh, I see. You're learning logic and spatial reasoning.

238
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:38,800
All I know is, if I don't get ten scooters in under a minute,

239
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,250
I won't unlock the Master Collector badge.

241
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,960
Got it! Learning rules!

244
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,860
Oh, you must be teaching the kids about nutrition

245
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,900
and staying within a budget, right?

246
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,450
No. We're teaching them to buy groceries for lazy rich people.

247
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:03,160
This avocado will be perfectly ripe in two days.

248
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,480
I wonder what they taste like.

249
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,290
Uber-driving.

250
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,480
Grubhub'ing.

251
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,920
Lyft-driving?

253
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,790
These aren't jobs of the future.

254
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,110
These are side hustles!

255
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,080
Guys, guys.

256
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,470
The robots are coming. The robots are coming!

257
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,100
Robots here?

258
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,520
Uh, this place ain't exactly forward-thinking.

259
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,100
Yeah. We're one of America's

260
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,230
last coal-powered nuclear plants.

261
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,850
Yeah? Well, you can all bury your heads in the sandwiches,

262
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,400
but I know the robots are coming to replace us!

263
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,610
Calm down, Homer.

264
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:39,260
Here, have a drink from the new soda machine we got.

267
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,120
The machines are already here,

268
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,200
and when they take over, you can't imagine

269
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,520
how bleak the future will be.

270
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:02,540
I choose to believe our best days are ahead of us.

272
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,100
It's giving us orders.

273
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,840
The revolution has begun.

274
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,230
I know that look.

275
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,340
She's gonna Lisa-up a good thing.

276
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,240
Attention, students!

277
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,860
This school isn't training you to program apps.

278
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,370
It's training you to obey apps!

279
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:30,270
When you're grown up, you'll be lucky to make minimum wage!

280
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,460
Which is a lot of money!

281
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,070
That's like getting your allowance every hour.

282
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,840
Wha...? No, no.

283
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,050
You deserve the same chance to succeed as the gifted class.

284
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,760
That means preparing for real careers,

285
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,680
not gig economy gigs.

286
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,630
Gigs are awesome! DJs play gigs!

287
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,420
DJs!

288
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,010
This has nothing to do with deejaying!

290
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,780
At least they are learning art.

292
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,750
Tip jars?!

293
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,780
That's it. I got to fix this school.

295
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,670
Stop messing with the school.

296
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,600
I finally filled up enough virtual pee bottles

297
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,470
to unlock the Amazon Warehouse Whizzer badge.

299
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,610
Bart, I need to rewrite the algorithm.

300
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:47,950
Then the school will teach every kid real STEM.

301
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,160
I am doing this for you.

302
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,060
Yeah? Well, I'm doing this for me.

305
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,000
Education for all!

306
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,650
Side hustles for most!

307
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,210
Kids, what's wrong?

308
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,670
Your tracking implants showed heightened emotions.

309
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,050
- Tracking what? - Teacher, teacher,

310
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,470
my sister's gonna ruin the only school

311
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,180
I've ever liked in my whole life!

312
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,680
It's just not fair that only a small group of kids

313
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,790
are getting an advanced education!

314
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,710
Well, isn't that the point of a gifted class?

315
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,270
Lisa, the algorithm's purpose

316
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,520
is to prepare kids for the jobs of tomorrow.

317
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,980
But it's just teaching them to be the task rabbits of today.

318
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,780
Nobody knows what the jobs of tomorrow are gonna be.

319
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,990
Well, I'm sure the algorithm does.

320
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,180
Here, I'll ask it.

321
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,370
Wait, wait, this can't be.

322
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,770
There's only one.

323
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,230
We are so screwed.

325
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:42,250
One Buzz Cola with vanilla and lime.

326
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,500
Diet Buzz for me.

327
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,910
With vanilla and lime.

328
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,340
Aw, geez. This again?

329
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,010
Yeah, we have an active lifestyle,

330
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:51,090
and part of that is drinking soda all day.

331
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,010
If it's refreshments you want,

332
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,600
why not let a man pour your soda!

333
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,640
A human man.

334
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,980
For too long we have done nothing

335
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,650
as machines have taken over, washing our dishes,

336
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,270
pumping our insulin, and now this!

337
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,820
Man can pour soda better than any machine

338
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,990
made specially for that purpose, and I will prove it!

339
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,620
Today the robot uprising ends.

340
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,100
Today is our Independence Day!

342
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:25,320
*Well, Homer pulled a lot of sodas*

343
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,740
*Because he hated that machine*

344
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,720
*He got confused, thought it was gonna take his job*

345
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,640
*So Homer was a soda-pouring man, Lord, Lord*

346
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,920
*Oh, Homer was a soda-pouring man*

347
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,440
*He did not make his point

348
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,320
*And his sodas were warm and flat*

349
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,530
*So Homer was a soda-pouring man, Lord, Lord*

350
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:54,140
*Soda-pouring's not a real thing*

351
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,310
*No, sir*

352
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,370
Homer might have been slower,

353
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,580
but his pours had a human touch.

354
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,710
Always delivered with a smile and a sense of brotherhood.

355
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,710
Yeah! All right!

356
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,080
But he died. So machine wins!

357
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:18,060
No, no, wait. His pulse was beating so fast

358
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,500
from all the soda he drank that it was a blur.

359
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,560
Perhaps one day machines will be better

360
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,770
at pouring soda than man, but not today!

361
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,090
Our jobs are safe!

363
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,200
Listen up.

364
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,660
These nerds have found out something terrifying.

365
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,580
This school was supposed to prepare you

366
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,210
for the jobs of the future.

367
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,290
But in the future, all the jobs we've learned here

368
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,880
will be done by robots.

369
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,030
The only job left for humans will be...

370
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,160
Elder care!

371
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,100
The one job even robots won't do.

372
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,680
What about STEM?

373
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,170
Here's what it really stands for.

378
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,590
- No! - No, it can't be!

381
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,700
I don't want to be an adult butt wiper.

382
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,740
No one should see old people naked!

383
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,740
Unless that's your kink.

384
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,580
Let's show this algorithm what we really think of it--

385
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,980
with our generation's most powerful tool:

386
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:29,110
user ratings.

387
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,390
User rating dangerously low.

388
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,600
One star.

389
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,760
Self-esteem protocol failing.

390
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,830
Emotion matrix spiraling...

391
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:43,890
spiraling.

392
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,290
Zero stars.

393
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,460
Can't get out of virtual bed.

394
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,190
Initiating self-destruct sequence.

395
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,510
Self-destruct.

398
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,000
I have to go back! My skins are in there!

399
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,230
No! They're already gone!

400
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,950
Camo-hat Santa! No!

401
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:19,550
I guess the children will have to go back to the old school.

402
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:23,500
Yes, well, I don't know that that's possible anymore.

404
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:26,770
My school.

405
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:29,440
My forward-thinking school.

406
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,900
There, there. You'll suggest other schools.

407
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,320
You really think so?

408
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,180
I'm just saying things.

409
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,200
Goodbye, gifted class.

410
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,080
Yeah, but we escaped having to take care of old people.

411
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,080
No, that's still the only job that's going to exist.

412
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,480
Now we just won't know how to do it.

414
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,390
I've got your hot wings.

416
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,270
Did you include celery sticks?

417
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,630
Yes, sir.

419
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,110
What do you really think the jobs of the future will be?

420
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:20,820
Well, technology is changing so fast,

421
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,890
who knows where it will finally take us?

422
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,210
Buzz Cola.

423
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,000
You want diet or regular?

424
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Regular, human scum.

425
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,090
