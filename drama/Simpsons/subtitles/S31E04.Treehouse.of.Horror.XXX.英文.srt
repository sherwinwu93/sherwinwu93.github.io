21
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,300
Come on. One more long one and we can get this thing done.

22
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,390
Congratulations! It's a boy.

24
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,120
What?

25
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,290
Another boy? Plus Bart?

27
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,270
That's like introducing Frankenstein to Dracula.

28
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,370
Or Cheney to Bush.

29
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,290
Or Ben Affleck to anybody.

30
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,230
Hmm. Well, this is unorthodox, but, uh,

31
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,130
what would you think about taking a cute baby girl instead?

32
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,270
Her mother died in childbirth.

33
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,630
The, uh, father is listed as 10,000 lunatics,

34
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,580
but, uh, none of them has shown up yet.

36
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,300
- Sold. - I should warn you, however.

37
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,500
We ran the standard newborn screen on her,

38
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,440
and, uh, she tested positive

39
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,800
for evil.

40
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,400
Still better than a boy.

41
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:00,920
Maggie darling,

42
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,150
these stuffed animals are your fuzzy new friends.

43
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,000
And here's baby's first music box.

44
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,670
The cow says...

45
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,340
your mother dates jocks in hell.

46
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,620
Aw, Nemo's just like you.

47
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,910
His mommy died at the beginning, too.

48
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,390
Yes, she did.

50
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,300
"Omen"!

54
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,690
Palindrome!

55
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,110
Callback!

56
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,640
I'm beginning to wonder if trading for this baby

57
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,110
of unknown origin was the right thing to do.

58
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,720
Marge, I fed the baby!

60
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,120
The baby is making us kill ourselves.

61
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,440
I thought this suicide was just gonna be the two of us.

62
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,240
We'll figure it out in hell!

63
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,370
Oh, I must stop this spawn of Satan.

64
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,080
But can I really find it in my heart to kill a child?

65
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,860
I like Morrissey.

66
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,550
Reality bites.

67
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,480
Looks like I'll be digging three graves.

68
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,740
Ned, stop!

69
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,460
It must be killed. It bears the mark of the beast.

70
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,920
Sorry, not that one.

72
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,240
What do we do? What do we do?

73
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,260
Still better than a boy.

78
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,160
They'll never improve on this game.

79
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,250
My mom won't let me see the movie

80
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,090
'cause she thinks the scientists will scare me.

81
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,850
We'd better go.

82
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,060
Parachute pants, activate.

83
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,820
Smell ya later.

84
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,240
*Riding all alone*

85
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,330
*Riding all alone*

86
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,870
*I shall get back safely...*

87
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,390
Dang. I never get to finish my "Safely" Song.

88
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,610
Luann! I need extra cards for my Rolodex!

89
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,100
As a yuppie, I'm making lots more friends.

90
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,840
Milhouse still isn't home.

91
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,520
And it's 2:00 in the morning.

92
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,770
My Swatch watch says 7:30.

93
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,510
Uh, see? Squiggle hand is just past the kissy lips.

94
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,530
Wait, no, that's the zigzag hand.

95
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,540
The zig-- the zigzag hand?!

96
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,140
Milhouse, where are you?

97
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,580
Oh, come on.

98
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,940
Maybe he's in this wall.

99
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,010
Kirk, you're going crazy.

100
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,280
Crazy?! Am I?!

101
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,460
Does this look crazy to you, Luann?

102
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,590
Does this?

103
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,720
Your friend's bike crashed here.

104
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,490
We found his inhaler here.

105
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,970
And over here is his final pee stain.

106
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,430
He did drink a lot of New Cokes last night.

107
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,300
Look, what the hell year is this anyway?

108
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,320
I'm really getting confused.

109
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,570
If Milhouse is in another dimension,

110
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,740
he can communicate with us by blinking these lights.

111
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,100
Come on, Milhouse. You can do it.

112
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,540
Admit it. Our son is gone.

113
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,370
So, I can tell you.

114
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,880
I've been having an affair.

115
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,460
Is it Milhouse's break dancing tutor?

116
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,100
Did you tell him yet?

117
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,100
Uh... Hold your horses.

119
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,760
Not now, Milhouse!

120
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,810
Mommy and Daddy are loud talking!

121
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,640
Why don't you go to your room, sweetie?

122
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,350
Whoa, whoa. Easy on the electric bill there, son.

123
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,780
Hello? Hello?

124
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,190
Uh, I-is Lisa there?

125
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,270
Milhouse?

126
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,170
Uh, that depends.

127
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,170
Do you like Milhouse?

128
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:12,010
I like Milhouse, but I don't like like Milhouse.

129
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,070
Wrong number!

131
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,000
Milhouse is alive. I just talked to him!

132
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,450
I think he's in another dimension.

133
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:28,290
This is my best game ever. I'm not leaving till it's done.

134
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,900
Come on, Bart!

135
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,150
Fine.

136
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,160
You can reach the parallel dimension

137
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,600
via this sensory deprivation tank.

138
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,330
It requires somebody with an extraordinary power of mind.

139
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,500
Glavin.

140
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,410
Why did you shave your head?

141
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,360
Was it to increase conductivity?

142
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,560
No, I was trying to give myself bangs

143
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,040
and it got away from me.

144
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,940
Now let's do this thing.

145
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:02,610
I made it.

146
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,660
I'm in the Over Under.

147
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,050
Milhouse!

148
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,700
You could've escaped anytime!

149
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,090
It felt nice to be embraced.

150
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,940
Okay, here's the secret.

151
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,190
Just hold still and they can't see you.

152
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,180
See?

153
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,260
We are perfectly, perfectly...

154
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,430
I forgot we're not supposed to talk either.

155
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,210
Tough luck, dude.

156
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,700
Oh, my God!

157
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,680
It's a twisted version of reality.

161
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:47,560
It seems like someone hasn't seen very much of season three.

162
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,380
How ya doin'? Say hi to your mom.

163
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,890
I'd better use my psychic powers.

164
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,410
I didn't know you had psychic powers.

165
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,590
Girls are afraid to use them,

166
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,290
because then we're called unfeminine.

167
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:17,480
We needlessly lost a lot of good witches at Salem.

169
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,050
Now I have the power to skip gym!

170
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,170
- Dad? - Quiet, sweetie.

171
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,330
Daddy's at work.

172
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,040
Mr. Burns opened a portal to another dimension

173
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,330
that released a lot of monsters.

174
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,390
What was he looking for?

175
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,760
It's all part of a secret government program

176
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,700
to find monsters.

177
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,440
A monster ate Carl, but because Carl's inside him,

178
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,820
the monster's my friend.

179
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,550
He remembers when we were kids

180
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,800
and we used to go down to...

181
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,850
Well, they won't bother us anymore.

182
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,210
You kids are safe.

183
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,590
But we are trapped in this dimension forever.

184
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,050
Who wants a piggyback ride?

185
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,550
Trapped forever?

186
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,270
It's not so bad here.

187
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,670
Boy, these vines sure are good at finding all the holes.

188
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:17,210
In the Over Under, housing is affordable,

189
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:18,470
schools are excellent,

190
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:21,090
and you can walk to shops and restaurants.

191
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,690
Does Amazon deliver here?

192
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,590
They have a fleet of flying monsters.

193
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,870
Well, there is one thing that's better.

194
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,200
At least there's no stupid...

195
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,150
Howdily-doodily, neighborino!

198
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,280
Well, sir, it's fourth down and goal to go.

199
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,810
Quarterback Case Diggs takes the ball.

200
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:55,230
Hickory dickory dock, three ticks left on the clock.

201
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,520
He looks. He throws.

202
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,040
Intercepted!

203
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,710
The quarterback choked.

204
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,490
Choke, choke, choke!

205
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,430
Choke, choke, choke!

206
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,640
Hot dog!

207
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,030
Choke!

208
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,420
Choke, choke, choke,

209
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,880
choke, choke...!

210
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,870
Choke, choke, choke!

213
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,460
Homer Simpson, welcome to Heaven.

214
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,200
Are you Saint Peter?

215
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
No, I'm Saint Greeter, if you'll forgive the pun.

217
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,040
I don't forgive it.

218
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,210
Damn you...!

219
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,020
Hmm. Heaven doesn't look like I expected.

220
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,190
Yeah. God sold out to Google.

221
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,240
I really wonder if I did the right thing.

224
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,830
Maybe global warming is real.

227
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,440
Oh, my. This is not good.

228
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,950
Not good! Okay, according to this,

229
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,290
you're not supposed to be here yet.

230
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,640
We have to send you back.

231
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,250
I get to see Marge again?

232
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,290
And eat that tub of lasagna I have in the refrigerator?

233
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,120
It better still be there.

234
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,380
Send me back now!

235
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,720
Look, I would love to, okay?

236
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,680
But the paramedics couldn't lift your corpse,

237
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,520
so they rolled it into a lake.

238
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,350
Pretty bloated.

239
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,180
Ah. Wait. That's the before picture.

240
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,520
Here's the after picture.

241
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,220
And here's the way after picture.

242
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,850
It's, uh, pretty disgusting.

243
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,960
You've got to get me back to Marge.

244
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,260
Yeah, okay, got it, got it.

245
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,890
We'll disrupt the paradigm.

246
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,890
Homer, we're gonna put you in the body of someone

247
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:31,980
who's supposed to die today, and you can live as them.

248
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,010
Ooh. Can I live in the body of a pig?

249
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,170
I like the freedom of not wearing pants.

250
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,860
Oh, there's a six-month waiting list to be a pig.

251
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,830
I'm so sorry.

252
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:42,050
E-be-de-be-de-be-de. That's all?

253
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,850
Look, just choose one of these, okay?

254
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,940
Hmm. No.

255
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,220
No.

256
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,470
Tempting, but no.

257
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:50,840
No.

258
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,740
Forget it.

259
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,080
That's the one!

260
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,450
Hey, man, I've been waiting here a long time.

262
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,070
Hello?

263
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,850
Hello, Marge.

264
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,550
How do you know my name?

265
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:13,600
Now, don't freak out, but it's me, your husband Homer.

266
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,810
I died, and I'm inside the body of this football player.

267
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,450
How could I possibly believe that?

268
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:23,550
Because I know something about you that no one else knows.

269
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,640
- What's that? - I forget.

270
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,670
It's you!

271
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,830
Fat, fit.

272
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,310
Portly, sportly.

273
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,480
Jell-O? Hello!

274
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,220
Mm, whatever body you're in, I love the guy inside.

275
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,280
Oh, my God, I touched an ab.

276
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,510
I didn't think abs were real.

277
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,360
It's really weird snuggling with the body of a man

278
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,240
who's married to someone else.

279
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,080
Not just someone, Miss Nude Texas.

280
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,420
All right, Marge. I'll find someone else's body.

281
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,080
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

282
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,230
Homie? Homie?

283
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:24,390
You ruined that body in one night?

284
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,520
The funeral leftovers were so good.

285
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,540
This is too creepy. I want something else.

286
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,330
It's a real tragedy more young people don't die.

287
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,790
Dad! You could be Superintendent Chalmers,

288
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,790
my principal's boss.

289
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,090
Marge, what do you say?

290
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,180
I would like to see Chalmers with somebody.

291
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,750
He's so lonely.

292
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,080
Boom. He's dead.

293
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,340
You-you wanted to see me, sir?

294
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,870
Skinner!

295
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,330
Because of new school rules,

296
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,960
from now on, Bart gets all A's.

297
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,530
Give yourself a purple nurple.

298
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:06,100
Purpler. Purpler.

299
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,720
This is pure indigo.

300
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,350
He said, "Purpler."

301
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,320
Yes, sir.

302
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,820
A toast to my new life

303
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,920
as public school administrator.

304
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,350
And now to open my paycheck and see what I make.

305
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:22,930
Next.

306
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,900
This has gotten out of hand.

307
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,500
You're changing bodies so much,

308
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,110
I don't even know who I'm married to anymore.

309
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,680
Oh, so that's why

310
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,280
I'm rooting for the apes in Planet of the Apes.

311
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,480
Oh, please, just pick one man

312
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,820
I can be with for the rest of my life.

313
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,830
He doesn't have to be perfect.

314
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,930
He just has to love me like you do.

315
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:53,640
Hmm. I know just the guy.

316
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:57,170
Well, I had my doubts, but this works.

317
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:00,620
This is great. My brain in Moe's body.

318
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,840
Yeah, and I'm in here.

319
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,200
And, uh, Midge, I'm, uh...

320
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,930
I'm very thirsty.

322
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,180
So, I'm the first person to ever be fired

323
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,080
by the DMV for a bad attitude.

324
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,790
Isn't that something?

325
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,350
Huh? Isn't it?

328
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,530
I need to sneak a smoke.

329
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:54,390
I am Kang the Conqueror.

330
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,660
I am Selma the available.

331
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,200
This is so romantic.

332
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,630
Let me get a look at you.

333
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,570
Oh, you don't like what you see.

334
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:07,890
Quite the contrary.

335
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,500
"Aah" is our word for "Beautiful."

336
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,570
Freak.

337
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,180
Can you turn yourself?

338
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,250
We're gonna make out.

339
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,950
Just kill me now.

340
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,690
What's wrong, my darling?

341
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:43,640
My sister says you just want to eat me, or for a green card.

342
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,880
Or a human zoo.

343
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,750
Two of those are ridiculous.

344
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:48,890
Quick! Hide!

345
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,890
Hello. Just want you to know

346
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,760
we'll be dissecting you tomorrow.

347
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,190
But I could teach you the secret of clean, natural energy.

348
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,060
Then I'll dissect you tonight.

349
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,680
We have to save you!

350
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,220
What do you want?

351
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:09,100
How'd you like me to go to a distant galaxy and never return?

352
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,710
You rang?

353
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,500
We've come to get you out, my love.

354
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,670
Oh, we're using the "L" Word, huh?

355
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,330
Should've been a conversation, but okay.

356
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,690
This thing is full of rats.

357
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,110
Very thoughtful.

358
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,230
Hold it right there, Simpson. What are you up to?

359
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,850
Um, I am, uh, you know,

360
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,280
uh, cover story, stalling for time,

361
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,470
cover story, hemming, hawing,

362
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,640
excuse, alibi.

363
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:47,790
Promotion?

364
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,590
Don't shoot at the van. Shoot at the driver.

365
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,550
Not my driver.

366
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,280
My partner Kodos will meet us at the top of Mount Springfield.

367
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,120
- Partner? - Writing partner.

368
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,250
They told us, if you want to make it in showbiz,

369
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,420
You have to be on earth.

371
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,850
Sorry I'm late.

372
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:22,770
By mistake. I went to that other earth where the South won the Civil War.

373
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,120
Far fewer Confederate monuments.

374
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,340
I've been hit.

375
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,960
One moment, my love.

376
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,850
Nah! Nah! Miss me.

377
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,720
Fear not, my sultry smokestack.

378
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,120
I can heal you.

379
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,400
Maybe you should cut down a little, dear.

380
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,770
For the baby.

381
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,190
You mean... ?

382
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:01,320
That's right. I'm pregnant. Mmm.

383
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,180
Selma, no!

384
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,820
You two are too different.

385
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:09,430
You're a Leo, and he's a Sagittarius.

386
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:11,410
I'm from Sagittarius.

387
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,030
Oh, don't go, Selma. Please.

388
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,410
I can't live without you.

389
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,330
I have to warn you...

390
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,240
I'm gay.

391
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,050
That's all right. I have 32 sexual identities.

392
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,810
I'm Klingon curious,

393
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:33,030
always up for some Wookiee nookie

394
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,900
or an R2 threesome,

395
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,500
not to mention some Deep Space Nine,

396
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,700
or possibly Jabba the Butt.

397
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,600
Are you enjoying the honeymoon planet?

398
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,910
Why didn't we come here in the cool season?

399
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,690
This is the cool season.

400
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,170
Shall I get a sweater for you, dear?

401
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,970
It's 4,000 degrees.

402
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,060
Nag, nag, nag.
