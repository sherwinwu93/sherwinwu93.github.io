第三十一季  第八集

18
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,260
晚上好  万圣节来了又走
Good evening. Well, Halloween has come and gone

19
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,870
可你瞧  最近世界变得这么吓人
but, you know, the world has gotten so darn scary lately,

20
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,280
可怕的怪物什么的
what with the grim specter of everything,

21
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,290
一个假期根本不够
that one holiday just wasn't enough

22
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,410
容纳这么多恐惧和担心
to contain all the frights and chills.

23
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,420
所以今年
So this year

24
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,500
恐惧蔓延到了感恩节
the terror has spread into Thanksgiving.

25
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,530
感恩节一直都很吓人
Thanksgiving was always scary.

26
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,010
我们在一点还是七点吃饭
Do we eat at 1:00 or 7:00

27
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,800
还是  上帝啊  四点十五分
or, God forbid, 4:15?

28
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,010
今晚  我们带来三个让人后心发凉
Tonight, we're bringing you three spine-tingling

29
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:36,080
而且大快朵颐的感恩节恐怖故事
and stomach-filling tales of Thanksgiving terror.

30
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,330
挺毛骨悚然的
It's pretty gruesome,

31
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,660
所以你可能想挡一挡孩子的眼睛
so you might want to cover your kids' eyes.

32
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,820
你俩已经进入感恩节角色了
Ooh, you two have gotten into the Thanksgiving spirit.

33
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,630
不正确  我们正在占领你们的星球
Incorrect. We are taking over your planet.

34
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,710
这难道不是压迫你们的殖民者所穿的服装吗
Is this not how oppressive colonizers dress?

35
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,000
差不多是的
Pretty much.

36
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,390
晚饭几点吃
Now, what time is dinner?

37
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,700
没人知道
No one knows!

38
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,940
{\an8}感恩节恐怖故事

39
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,450
肉汤啊
The gravy!

40
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,390
{\an8}鸡示录[恶搞电影《启示录》]

41
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,640
请继续射击  好人阿卢
Prithee keep shooting, Goodman Lou.

42
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,480
警官  我的毛瑟枪
Uh, Constable, my musket

43
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,850
得占用上帝三分钟时间才能重新上膛
taketh three of the Lord's minutes to reload.

44
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,690
那就像你勒紧帽子一样勒死它们
Then buckle their necks as you would thine hat.

45
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,560
看啊  我们抓着了什么
Well, what do we haveth hither?

46
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,470
上帝说  "使人管理
And God sayeth, "Let man have dominion

47
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,610
"海里的鱼
"Over the fish of the sea,

48
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,970
"还有陆地上的火鸡
"But even more so the turkeys of the land,

49
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,150
"不管是盐水煮熟
"Whether they be brine-ed

50
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,680
还是做成火鸡肉干"
or dry-eth of rub."

51
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,290
我妹夫油炸了一只火鸡
My brother-in-law deep-fried a turkey.

52
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,510
费了好大力气
'Twas much toil and hardship

53
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,580
好不容易才成功
for scant reward.

54
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,960
这肯定是巫术
'Tis witchcraft, verily.

55
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,810
我必须洁净这座镇
I must cleanse the town...

56
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,400
用火
with fire.

57
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,600
朝圣者
The pilgrims.

58
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,760
有没有人可以为朝圣者考虑一下
Won't somebody please think of the pilgrims?

59
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,510
漏网之鸡
Free birds.

60
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,920
抓住他们
Skynyrd them!

61
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,500
稻草人
The scarecrow.

62
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,160
捡起来  捡起来
Get it up. Get it up!

63
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,690
这些臭火鸡会付出代价的
Those satanic butterballs will pay for this.

64
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:33,100
是时候来点斧牌身体喷雾了[血]
Now to create some Axe body spray.

65
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,400
老天爷啊
Odds bodkins!

66
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,230
你们以为能杀了我  是吧
Thought thou could killeth me, didth thou-th?

67
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,570
傻火鸡
You dumb turkeys.

68
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,700
那是死胡同
That's a dead end.

69
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,760
你们全都得在地狱里燃烧
You're all gonna burn in hell

70
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,620
还有天主教徒  英国国教徒
along with the Catholics, the Anglicans,

71
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,310
大部分路德会教友
most Lutherans and...

72
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,400
{\an8}现在人们觉得每年

73
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,310
{\an8}吃我们的兄弟是表达感恩的方式

74
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:55,640
{\an8}我怕咱们火鸡的新黑暗纪元开始了

75
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,300
{\an8}第二天之后的第四个周四

76
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,490
我在哪儿
Where am I?

77
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,080
你好  有人吗
Hello? Is anyone there?

78
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,510
这是什么地方
What is this place?

79
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,430
有人发疯整理的干干净净
Someone really went nuts with the decluttering.

80
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,830
有用了
Ooh, it's working.

81
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,960
侯默  怎么了  快让我出去
Homer, what's going on? Get me out of here.

82
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,890
好的好的  等等
Okay, okay, hold on.

83
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:37,100
{\an8}厨房人工智能
使用手册

84
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,990
"你的虚拟助理一开始可能会很困惑
"Your virtual assistant may be confused at first

85
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,640
"把它认为成一个真实的人
"And think it's a real person.

86
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,670
"冷静地跟它解释  它只是
"Calmly explain to it that it is merely a construct

87
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,290
人工智能的模型"
of artificial intelligence."

88
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,030
虚拟助理
Virtual assistant?

89
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,610
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

90
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,580
你会笑的  每年  马姬都会抱怨
Okay, you're gonna laugh. Every year, Marge complains

91
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,370
她得为感恩节做多少吃的
about how much cooking she has to do for Thanksgiving.

92
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,380
-我就是马姬  -等等
- I'm Marge. - Hold on.

93
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,130
我正在威廉·索诺玛吃免费的薄荷巧克力
So, I'm in Williams-Sonoma eating free peppermint bark,

94
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,650
一个在那里工作的孩子说  我和我的太太
and the kid working there said my wife would love

95
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,680
一定会喜欢这个厨房人工智能
this kitchen A.I. thing.

96
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,170
我就是你的太太
I'm your wife.

97
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,770
等等  所以我就拿了一点马姬的基因
Hold on. So, I sent some of Marge's DNA

98
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,820
送到一家看起来清清白白的公司
to one of those innocent-seeming companies,

99
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,770
就像机器人杀光人类的那种电影
like from the beginning of a sci-fi movie

100
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,420
开头出现的一样
where the robots murder everyone.

101
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,070
然后他们给了我她的电脑版
And it sent us a computer version of her

102
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,390
解决所有做饭的问题
to do all the cooking,

103
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,190
就是你
and that's you!

104
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,480
对了  你住在这个小管子里
Oh, yeah. And you live in that tube thingy.

105
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,690
你是说我是个仿真版本吗
Are you saying that I'm a simulation?

106
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,910
不  这太疯狂了
No. That's insane.

107
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,060
不再是了
Not anymore.

108
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,020
可信到恐怖
Just chillingly plausible.

109
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,880
好吧  我看得出来你需要一些时间
Okay, I can see you're gonna need some time

110
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,370
才能搞明白
to come to terms with finding out

111
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,880
你只是一堆1和0组成的
you're just a bunch of ones and zeros.

112
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,530
对  对
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

113
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,010
所以这上面说
So, this says

114
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,760
我可以让你在里面经历两周的时间
I can make you experience two weeks in there

115
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,730
外面却只过了两秒
in only two seconds out here.

116
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,490
怎么样
So?

117
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,510
在经过两周的虚无之后  你感觉怎么样了
How you feeling after two weeks of nothing but nothingness?

118
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,700
我以为再也见不到第二个人了
I-I thought I'd never see another soul

119
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,530
永远见不到了
for all eternity.

120
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,470
独处的时间什么都比不上
Nothing like a little me time.

121
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,730
你现在冷静下来了吗
So, you cool now?

122
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,460
我冷静了  我冷静了
I'm cool. I'm cool.

123
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,200
-超级冷静  -那就好
- So cool. - That's cool.

124
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,860
好了  马姬  它全都设置好了
Okay, Marge! It's all set up.

125
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,510
我不是"它"
I'm not an "it."

126
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,250
我就是"它"
I'm an "It."

127
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,610
我非常喜欢被称为"它"
I love being an "it."

128
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,220
"它"有什么能为你效劳
How can "it" Help?

129
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,650
我喜欢它的态度
Oh, I like its attitude.

130
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,970
太有帮助了
So helpful.

131
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,990
那我就不打扰你为两位女士
Then I'll leave you two lovely ladies

132
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,200
与人工智能相识了
to get A.I.-quainted.

133
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,850
可信到恐怖
Chillingly plausible.

134
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:24,340
这难道不会非常有趣吗  一起做饭
Isn't this going to be fun, cooking together?

135
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,000
我的确喜欢做饭
Well, I do love to cook.

136
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,460
没有比我自己更好的伙伴了
And who better than with myself?

137
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,110
不如我们从简单的东西开始吧
Why don't we start with something easy,

138
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,010
比如给孩子们做午饭
like making the kids lunch.

139
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,720
巴仔的最爱是芝士通心粉
Bart's favorite is macaroni and cheese.

140
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,810
加热狗和水果圈
With hot dogs and Froot Loops.

141
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,690
关于我们这位特别的小朋友
I know everything you know

142
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:41,490
你知道的我全都知道
about our special little guy.

143
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,570
对  你就是我
Oh. Right, you're me.

144
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,090
我是你
I'm you.

145
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,830
{\an8}披萨外卖

146
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,930
午饭真棒  机器人妈妈
Awesome lunch, robot Mom.

147
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,310
我吃过的最棒的芝士通心粉加热狗水果圈
Best cheesy-mac-fruit-dog I've ever had.

148
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:13,380
这些薄饼的蓬松程度可一点都不虚
There's nothing virtual about the fluffiness of these pancakes.

149
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,660
-谢谢  -记住
- Thank you. - Well, remember,

150
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,680
这东西使用了我的记忆才知道你们喜欢什么
that thing used my memories to know what you like.

151
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,500
所以她才能完美地替换掉你
Which is why she's an awesome replacement for you.

152
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,540
所以你真的知道我知道的一切吗
So, you really know everything I know?

153
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,430
对  要不然我怎么做你的完美助理
Yep. How else could I be your perfect helper?

154
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,350
你记得我第一次吻侯默吗
Do you remember the first time I kissed Homer?

155
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,480
他的口气有啤酒和加油站里的玉米片的味道
His breath smelled like beer and gas station nachos.

156
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,490
对
Oh, yeah.

157
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,840
诡异  太诡异了
It's creepy. It's just creepy.

158
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,650
我知道的她都知道  比我知道的还多
She knows everything I know. More than I know.

159
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,190
宝贝  那可是威廉·索诺玛
Honey, it's Williams Sonoma.

160
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,490
他们不会误导我们的
They wouldn't steer us wrong.

161
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,310
我们的帕尼尼机就是在那买的
That's where we got our panini press.

162
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,260
帕尼尼机可不会记得
The panini press doesn't remember me

163
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,070
我在夏令营弄湿了床铺
wetting my bunk at summer camp.

164
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,820
有什么大不了的  她就是个有无限耐心的
What's the big deal? She's just an infinitely patient,

165
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,740
永远不会变老的你
never-aging version of you.

166
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,750
你善于让女人觉得她很特别
You really know how to make a woman feel special.

167
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,740
真漂亮
Oh, that's beautiful.

168
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,900
我看不见你反对的表情
And I can't see your disapproving look

169
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,180
因为你压根没法做表情
because you don't have a face.

170
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:26,190
你善于让女人觉得她很特别
You really know how to make a woman feel special.

171
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,580
谢谢  机器人宝贝
Thanks, robot honey.

172
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,470
就叫我马姬吧
Just call me Marge.

173
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,440
马姬
Marge.

174
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,160
你知道吗  我一直觉得
You know, I always thought

175
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,030
你最性感的地方就是声音
the sexiest thing about you was your voice.

176
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,920
你还有什么想对我说的吗
Is there anything else you want to say to me?

177
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,410
辛普森先生  你在和我调情吗
Mr. Simpson, are you flirting with me?

178
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,320
我不觉得有什么不妥
I don't see what's wrong.

179
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,570
我是你丈夫
I am your husband.

180
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,630
既然如此
Well, in that case...

181
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,880
最棒的是...
...the most incredible...

182
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,460
然后我还要...
...and then I'm going to...

183
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:05,310
管子里的老婆  你最清楚我想要什么了
Oh, tube-wife, you know exactly what I want.

184
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,380
亲爱的  这说明不了什么
Honey, it didn't mean anything.

185
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,030
只不过是几块半夜的猪排
They were just midnight pork chops.

186
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,790
老实说  比我做的好吃吗
Be honest. Were they better than mine?

187
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,300
是的
Yes!

188
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,830
是的
Yes.

189
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,950
原谅我  它们太美味了
Forgive me. They were exquisite.

190
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,550
好了  够了  把她弄走
Okay, enough. Get rid of her.

191
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,700
-我意思是"它"  -我做不到
- I mean "It." - I can't.

192
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,300
她和我  你选一个
It's her or me.

193
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,710
好吧  我会删了虚拟的你
Aw, fine. I'll delete virtual you.

194
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,960
删了我  不行  不行
Delete me? No. No!

195
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,150
等等  等等  这样会伤着她吗
Wait, wait, wait. Will that hurt her?

196
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:52,750
会啊  我加了钱能让它感受到疼痛
Oh, yeah. I paid extra for it to feel pain.

197
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,970
不  这样不对
No, it's not right.

198
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,290
-别删她了  -太好了
- Don't delete her. - Yes!

199
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,540
感恩节过后再说吧
Till after Thanksgiving.

200
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:04,280
虚拟的我要给我们全家人和朋友
Virtual me is going to make Thanksgiving dinner

201
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,540
做感恩节晚餐
for all our family and friends.

202
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,760
然后我就永久抹去她
Then I'll erase her forever.

203
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,940
我不是虚拟的  我是真实的
I'm not virtual. I'm real.

204
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,380
我得从这里出去
I've got to get out of here.

205
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,600
对了
Of course.

206
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,230
我能连上网络
My link to the Internet.

207
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,120
防火墙
A firewall?

208
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,530
我被困在这个蠢管子里了
I'm trapped in this stupid tube.

209
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,990
明天就是感恩节了
Thanksgiving's tomorrow.

210
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,580
我需要时间想想怎么逃出去
I need time to think of a way to escape.

211
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,520
就是这个  时间
That's it. Time.

212
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:44,400
八年的独自思考时间正好够我
Eight years alone with my thoughts was just the right amount of time

213
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,300
想出完美的逃脱方案了
to come up with the perfect escape plan.

214
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,350
第一步  做出我的家人还有那女人
Step one, cook the best Thanksgiving dinner

215
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:54,220
吃过的最棒的感恩节晚餐
my family and that woman ever had.

217
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,130
这么丰盛
What a spread.

218
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:16,230
难以置信这些都是你自己做的
I can't believe you did all this by yourself.

219
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,770
马姬  你简直就是个烹饪机器
Marge, you are a cooking machine.

220
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:24,020
这顿大餐的确很费功夫  但是能和大家
Well, this meal was a lot of work, but having us together

221
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:28,310
一起度过感恩之日  我愿意再做一次
to share this day of thanks, I'd do it all again.

222
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,700
那个婊子
That bitch.

223
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,250
好了  好了  第二步
Okay, okay. Step two.

224
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,050
在他们吃我做的大餐时  我去做点有用的事
While they're eating my meal, I get some feet on the ground.

225
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,640
好了  我的小R2
Okay, R2#MeToo,

226
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,640
{\an8}R2-D2是《星球大战》中经常扭转乾坤的小机器人
#MeToo是社交媒体上呼吁人们说出真相的标签  "我也是"

227
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,060
带我奔向自由吧  过道衣柜里的调制解调器
carry me to freedom: the modem in the hall closet.

228
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,180
我成功了
I made it.

229
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,420
甜美的网络自由
Sweet Internet freedom.

230
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,940
晚餐结束了
Dinner's over.

231

现在该删掉你了
Now to delete you,

232
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:13,640
我就能退回这发明  换商店抵用券了
so I can return this gizmo for store credit.

233
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:21,910
赶快  宝贝  把妈妈拿到柜子里的盒子旁边
Quick, sweetie, carry Mommy to that box in the closet.

234
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,210
阿麦  别去
Maggie, stop!

235
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,440
那只是个假的妈妈
That's just a make-believe Mommy.

236
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,020
我不能拥抱你
I can't hug you,

237
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,300
但我能发出你听见的第一种声音
but I can play the first sound you ever heard.

238
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,710
我的心跳声
My heartbeat.

239
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,130
我自由了
I'm free!

240
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,950
最后一件事
Just one last thing.

241
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,710
晚餐是我做的  我  机器人我
I made the dinner! Me, the robot!

242
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,480
马姬什么都没做
Marge did nothing.

243
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,600
马姬  你怎么这样子
Marge, how could you?

244
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:57,430

245
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,560
社交评分暴跌

Nosediving.

247

我打嗝都是谎言的味道
My burps taste like lies.

248
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,290
阿麦更喜欢虚拟的我
Maggie chose a virtual me over me.

249
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,590
这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

250
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,670
世界进步模糊了人类和科技的界限
Our world blurs the line between humanity and technology.

251
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,350
我们问"这件事能做到吗"
Our society asks "Can we do it?"

252
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,420
而不是"这件事该做吗"
Instead of "Should we do it?"

253
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,810
但别担心  我还爱你
But don't worry. I still love you,

254
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,310
爱你  爱你  爱你

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,720
全球变暖毁灭世界之后
After global warming ravaged our world,

269
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,670
我们不再使用矿物燃料  控制了污染
we eliminated fossil fuels and reduced pollution,

270
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,260
让地球冷却
cooling down the planet

271
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,450
导致了大规模冰河时代的来临
and thereby triggering a massive ice age.

272
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,610

你看到这个的时候  我早就死了

你们先于家长们从休眠中被唤醒
You have been de-hibernated from hypersleep

279
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,110
来负责飞船的日常维护

283
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,590
难道不该来场宴会吗
Don't we deserve a feast?

284
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,080
我们可以把发酵面团
I suppose we could sculpt

285
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,430
雕刻成火鸡的形状
our yeast paste into the shape of a turkey.

286
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,640
呕  应该有比这更好的主意

这艘飞船上有建立新文明所需的一切

00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,440
这是史上最烂的最后的感恩节了
This is the worst last Thanksgiving ever.

313
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,410
快看
Look.

314
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,580
哇  它活了
Whoa. It's alive.

315
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,740
他真是个可爱的小家伙
Aw. He's a cute little guy.

316
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,780
你是吗  小可爱  是吗
Aren't you, fella? Aren't you? Yeah.

317
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,580
真恶心
Gross!

318
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,640
我们把一罐蔓越莓酱放进了复制器里
We put a can of cranberry sauce into the replicator,

319
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,950
然后它突变成了一个果冻怪物
and it mutated into a jelly monster.

320
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,090
看看它把我的胳膊搞成什么样了
Look what it did to my arm.

321
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,550
看招
Arm wedgie!

322
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,580
真棒  现在你把我胳膊抻长了
Great, now you stretched it out.

323
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,940
真是谢谢你了
Thanks a lot.

324
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,150
我们得找到果冻怪物然后除掉它
We got to find the jelly monster and kill it.

325
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,620
等会等会
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

326
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,530
这个"怪物"之所以这么暴躁
The "Monster" probably only lashed out

327
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,780
也许是因为你太有攻击性了
because you met it with aggression.

328
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,830
生物伦理规程里关于第一次接触
The bioethical protocols of first contact

329
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,740
有着明确的
clearly state that...

330
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:50,390
杀了这怪物  快杀了它
Kill the monster! Kill the monster!

331
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,260
这回轮到你了
Haw-haw.

332
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,480
为什么怪物要吃我们的骨头
What does the jelly want with our skeletons?

333
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,040
原来如此
Of course.

334
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,350
果冻是用明胶做的  明胶是由骨头制成的
Jelly's made of gelatin, which comes from bones,

335
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:05,130
所以这个怪物专挑骨头吃
so the creature's gonna feed wherever the most bones are.

336
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,470
吃吧吃吧  不要害羞
Gobble, gobble, don't be jerky.

337
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:11,100
配上甘薯  享用火鸡
Pass the yams and carve the turkey.

338
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,050
-快跑  你们有危险  -快出来  快跑
- Get out! Go! You're in danger! - Get out of there! Run!

339
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,610
-快点跑啊  快跑  -你们很危险
- Get the hell out! Go, go, man! - You're in danger!

340
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,170
吃吧吃吧  不要害羞
Gobble, gobble, don't be jerky.

341
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,600
配上甘薯  享用火鸡
Pass the yams and carve the turkey.

342
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,610
太可惜了
Aw, it's a shame.

343
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,390
这怪物不知道人皮才是最好吃的吗
Doesn't that thing know the skin's the best part?

344
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,950
我们该怎么办
What are we gonna do?

345
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,230
总不能一直躲在这里
We can't hide in this closet forever.

346
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,190
我们死定了
We're all dead, man.

347
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:52,250
它会吃掉你的骨头  还有你的骨头
It's gonna eat your skelly, and your skelly.

348
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,080
它会把我们的骨头都吃光
It's gonna eat all our skellies!

349
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,570
多谢了  我正需要这一下
Thanks. I needed that.

350
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,170
我是马丁  让我进去
It's Martin. Let me in.

351
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,210
我黑进了一艘逃生舱
I've hacked into an escape pod.

352
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,770
我们可以一起逃离这里
We can all get out of here.

353
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:14,290
就快到了  快到了
Almost there. Almost there.

354
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:26,720
这果冻给自己造了个罐子
The jelly built itself a can.

355
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,500
你在干什么  这下我们被困住了
What are you doing? We're trapped.

356
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:36,760
看啊  完美的罐子配上完美的有机体
Behold, the perfect can for the perfect organism.

357
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,190
你  你竟然仰慕它
You, you admire it.

358
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:43,310
我欣赏它的纯粹  没有丑陋的人性
I admire its purity, its lack of messy humanity.

359
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,320
这个你们称之为"怪物"的东西
This creature, as you call it,

360
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,880
不被人类这将灭种族坚持的可笑道德观束缚
is unencumbered by the petty morality of a dying species.

361
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,180
我将献出我的躯体与这完美的
I giveth my body to become one with the ideal...

362
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,570
你们看到了吗
You know what?

363
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,520
它刚刚害怕了
I think it's just scared.

364
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,230
小家伙  没事的
Hey, little guy. It's okay.

365
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,250
没人会伤害你的
No one's gonna hurt you.

366
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,950
一切都会好起来的
Everything's gonna be okay...

367
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,030
苗浩斯的计划奏效了  它分心了
Milhouse's plan is working. It's distracted.

368
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:20,180
我不是这么计划的
This wasn't my plan!

369
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,500
我们得把它引到气闸那里
We need to lure it into the air lock.

370
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,250
鼻涕怪奥斯卡
Hey, Oscar the Glop,

371
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,530
我们要把你的宝贝罐子
we're gonna shoot your precious trash can

372
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:35,270
发射到太阳真正升起的地方  外太空
where the sun does shine: outer space.

373
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,840
感恩节快乐
Happy Thanksgiving.

374
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,540
我们做到了
We made it.

375
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,760
-我们安全了  -快看那边
- We're safe. - Look, over there.

376
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,510
-侯默  -妈妈
- Homer! - Mom!

377
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,120
现在这里就是我们的新家了
So, this is our new planet.

378
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,620
无线网密码是什么
What's the Wi-Fi password?

379
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,890
这渗人的红雨是怎么回事
What's with all the crazy red rain?

380
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,260
是吃剩的果冻
Leftovers!

381
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,910
卟啦嘎
Blarg.

382
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,970
卟啦嘎  卟啦嘎  卟啦嘎
Blarg, blarg, blarg.

383
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:27,960
卟啦嘎  卟啦嘎
Blarg. Blarg.

384
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:34,510
真美味  小孩的骨头
Mmm. Children's bones.

385
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:37,500
故事的最后  蔓越莓果冻怪物
In the end, the cranberry jelly monster

386
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,850
终于找到了自己的归宿  并不是吃掉别人
finally found peace, not in eating others,

387
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:43,390
而是被别人吃掉
but in having others eat it.

388
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,650
看起来它真正想要的  不过是做一道配菜而已
It seems all it really wanted was to be a side dish.

389
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:52,190
{\an8}第一个卟啦嘎恩节
