164
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,410
我不知道你还能通灵
I didn't know you had psychic powers.

165
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,590
女孩们不敢用
Girls are afraid to use them,

166
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,290
因为那时候我们不能被称为女性
because then we're called unfeminine.

167
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:17,480
我们在塞勒姆不必要地失去了很多优秀的女巫

00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,390
他在找什么
What was he looking for?

175

这都是一个政府秘密计划的一部分
It's all part of a secret government program

176

00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,440
这只怪兽吃了卡尔  但是因为卡尔在他体内
A monster ate Carl, but because Carl's inside him,

178
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,820
这只怪兽就是我的朋友了
the monster's my friend.

179
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,550
他还记得我们儿时的事情
He remembers when we were kids

180
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,800
我们会一起去
and we used to go down to...

181
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,850
好了  他们不会再烦我们了
Well, they won't bother us anymore.

182
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,210
你们安全了
You kids are safe.

183
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,590
只是我们被永远困在这个维度里了
But we are trapped in this dimension forever.

184
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,050
谁想坐在我的肩上走一程
Who wants a piggyback ride?

185
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,550
永远困住
Trapped forever?

186
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,270
这里也不算太差
It's not so bad here.

187
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,670
天哪  这些藤蔓总能找到所有小洞

他们有一支飞行怪兽送货小队

193
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,870
这里至少有一点好

201
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,520
他在看时机  他掷球了
He looks. He throws.

202
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,040
球被截住了
Intercepted!

I don't forgive it.

218
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,210

天堂和我想的不一样
Hmm. Heaven doesn't look like I expected.

220
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,190
没错  因为上帝投靠了谷歌

你还不该到这里来
you're not supposed to be here yet.

230

236
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,680
但是当时医护人员抬不动你的尸体
But the paramedics couldn't lift your corpse,

237
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,520
所以他们就把你滚进了湖里
so they rolled it into a lake.

238
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,350
浮肿得厉害
Pretty bloated.

239

你得把我送回到马姬身边
You've got to get me back to Marge.

244

侯默  我们可以把你放进一个

我能住在猪的身体里吗

我喜欢不用穿裤子的自由感
I like the freedom of not wearing pants.

250
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,860
想要变成猪  有一个六个月长的等候名单

我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

252
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:42,050
就这样吗
E-be-de-be-de-be-de. That's all?

253
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,850
就从这些里面选一个吧  好吗
Look, just choose one of these, okay?

254
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,940
不行

Now, don't freak out, but it's me, your husband Homer.

266

我死了  现在在这个足球运动员的身体里
I died, and I'm inside the body of this football player.

267
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,450

How could I possibly believe that?

268
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:23,550
我知道你不为人知的小秘密
Because I know something about you that no one else knows.

269
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,640
-什么秘密  -忘了

275
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,280
老天保佑  我摸到了腹肌
Oh, my God, I touched an ab.

276
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,510
我还以为腹肌都是假的
I didn't think abs were real.

277
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,360
和其他已婚男人的肉体亲热
It's really weird snuggling with the body of a man

278
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,240
感觉好奇怪
who's married to someone else.

279

葬礼剩下的食物真的很好吃
The funeral leftovers were so good.

285
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,540
太可怕了  我要换人

286
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,330
死掉的年轻人越来越少了  真悲剧
It's a real tragedy more young people don't die.

287

爹  你能当校监查尔默斯
Dad! You could be Superintendent Chalmers,

288
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,790
他是我们校长的老板
my principal's boss.

289
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,090
马姬  你觉得呢
Marge, what do you say?

290
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,180
我挺希望他能有个伴
I would like to see Chalmers with somebody.

291
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,750

He's so lonely.

292
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,080

史金纳
Skinner!

295
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,330
由于新的学校规定
Because of new school rules,

296
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,960
从此以后  巴仔的每门课都必须得优秀
from now on, Bart gets all A's.

297
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,530
把你的乳头扭成紫色

已经是纯靛蓝色了
This is pure indigo.

300
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,350
他说了继续
He said, "Purpler."

301
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,320

306
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,900
这太疯狂了
This has gotten out of hand.

307
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,500
你换身体太频繁了
You're changing bodies so much,

308
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,110
我已经不知道我嫁给谁了
I don't even know who I'm married to anymore.

309
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,680
难怪我在《人猿星球》里
Oh, so that's why

310
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,280
站在猩猩一边
I'm rooting for the apes in Planet of the Apes.

311
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,480
拜托你  选定一个合适的
Oh, please, just pick one man

312
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,820
然后我们一起继续好好生活
I can be with for the rest of my life.

313
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,830
他不必完美
He doesn't have to be perfect.

314
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,930
只要像你一样爱我就好
He just has to love me like you do.

315
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:53,640
