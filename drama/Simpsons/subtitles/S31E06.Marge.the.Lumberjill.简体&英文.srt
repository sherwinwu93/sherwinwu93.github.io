我们应该把手机和呼机静音吗
Should we silence our cell phones and pagers?

27
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,060
不不不  拜托就开着吧
No, no, no, please, I beg you, leave them on.

28

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,160
猪头  老爹快餐店有一起谋杀案
Jughead, there's been a murder at Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe

31
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,450
只有小孩才能解决
and it's up to us kids to solve it.

32
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,500
我现在没法管这件事
I can't deal with that right now.

33
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,250
我老爸在监狱里  唯一能把他弄出来的办法

34
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,830

38
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,580
一个小孩打电子游戏的油管视频
of kids playing a video game?

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,920
-没错  -终于

想拿到他们的能量饮料[堡垒之夜道具]
Okay, to get their chug jugs,

41
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,020
我可以把他们一个个狙击掉
I could snipe these guys out one by one,

42
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,060
但更聪明的做法
but the smarter move is to plant a charge

43
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,810
是在他们攻击平台的底部放一个炸药
at the base of their attack platform

44
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,730
等他们一着陆就炸上天

67
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,080
我要梦到自己在柔软可爱的棺材里
Well, I'm gonna dream about me in a soft, cuddly crypt.

68
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,460
令人惊奇的是  接下来的作品并非基于
Amazingly, this next piece is not based on something

69
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,300
你在手机或加油泵上看到的东西
you watch on your phone or a gas pump,

70
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,300
而是一部实实在在地地道道的戏剧

这个家里唯一可靠的就是你
The only stable thing in this house is you,

84

87
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,840
振作精神
things will perk up.

88

你可以从咖啡渗滤壶身上学到很多

妈妈这个角色真是令人犯困
The mother character is such a snooze.

92

拉尔夫根本不能跟她形成冲突
Ralph has nothing to play against.

93
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,260
他们觉得我无聊
They think I'm boring.

94
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,430
这出戏是有关我们家的
This play is about us!

95
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,690
今天我决定做一个赛车手
Today I decided to be a race car driver,

96
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,740
于是我去了  然后我又不去了
so I was, then I quit.

97
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,950
我也有令人激动的消息
I also have exciting news.

98
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,450
我把四块小肥皂屑
I converted four soap slivers

99
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,520
融化成了一块新肥皂
into practically a new bar.

100
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,440
这个世界就是这么看我的吗
Is this how the world sees me-- as a...

101
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,750
现在的孩子怎么说没劲
How do the kids say lame these days?

102
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,780
我们说没劲儿  你真没劲儿
We say lame-o, you lame-o.

103
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,880
吸吸  我感觉像是迷雾里的
Suck, suck. And I felt like the ghost

104
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,590
一个鬼魂
belonging to the fog.

105
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,090
迷雾就是鬼魂的海洋
And the fog was the ghost of the sea.

106
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,580
吸吸
Suck, suck.

107
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,760
你真的觉得我那么无聊吗
You really think I'm that boring?

108
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,060
丽莎  你让别人感到不开心了
Lisa, you made someone feel sad,

109
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,470
这可不是家庭剧该造成的结局
which is not what a drama about a family is supposed to do.

110
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,220
马姬  能合张影吗
Marge, could we get a picture?

111
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,350
好的
Okay.

112
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,450
{\an8}春田第一教堂
现在有泡过黄瓜的洗礼盆

113
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,950
所以世世代代
So all the generations...

114
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,070
无聊  他们觉得我无聊
Boring. They think I'm boring.

115
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,940
我要让他们看看谁才无聊
I'll show them who's boring.

116
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,380
今早  马姬·辛普森强烈自愿前来
Now, this morning, Marge Simpson has insistently volunteered

117
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,610
读一段
to read a passage.

118
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,030
她说她将融入自己的理解
She says she's gonna bring her own spin to it.

119
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,970
现在来读一段《约翰福音》  18章38节
Now, a reading from John, 18:38,

120
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,590
庞修斯·彼拉多和耶稣之间的对话
between Pontius Pilate and Jesus.

121
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,170
马姬  马姬  马姬
Marge! Marge! Marge!

122
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,970
天呀  耶稣
Hey-a Jesus,

123
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,270
你怎么个回事
what's a matter for you?

124
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,840
你说你是个国王
You saying youse a king?

125
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,260
他是个罗马人  所以我才用这种口音
He was Roman, that's why I'm doing the accent.

126
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:33,030
总之  耶稣回答  我觉得耶稣应该
Anyhoo, Jesus answered, and I think it might have gone

127
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,640
差不多长这样
something like this.

128
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,860
我不是国王  我是个木匠
I'm not a king, I'm a carpenter.

129
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,390
一个犹太木匠
A Jewish carpenter.

130
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,230
我唯一能搞定的就是美国大学入学考试
The only thing I nail are my SATs.

131
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,660
然后  庞修斯对老者说
So then, Pontius says to the elders,

132
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,200
这个是个耶稣  他看起来是个好人
"This-a Jesus, he-a look like a nice-a guy."

133
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,830
没人像这个样子讲话
Nobody talk-a like-a that.

134
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,420
我能说一句流畅的话
I make a nice-a sentence.

135
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,870
就像妈妈之前教的一样
Just like-a Mama used to construct.

136
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,260
我们能听勒弗乔伊布道吗
Can we just hear Lovejoy's sermon, please?

137
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,830
对  马姬  有点眼力见
Yeah, Marge, read the room.

138
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,960
你比我们更需要这些  女士
You need this more than we do, lady.

139
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,200
无聊  一个全优的女童子军
Boring. That's what this straight-A Girl Scout

140
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,100
变成了这样  无聊
has become-- boring.

141
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,210
你刚刚在鬼门关走了一遭
You just had a near-death experience.

142
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,360
真让人兴奋
That's exciting.

143
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,360
你的人生真是精彩  妈妈
What a rich life you lead, Mom.

144
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,370
我要去睡了
I'm going to bed.

145
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,760
这真的会改变你无聊的名声
That will really turn around your boring reputation.

146
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,570
别担心  侯默  我去砍木头
Don't worry, Homer, I'll chop the wood.

147
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,770
像往常一样
Like always.

148
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,110
什么都要我做
I have to do everything.

149
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,440
树都要我砍
Even chop the trees.

150
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,590
我知道她可以把砍树的功夫用到哪去
I know where she can put that chopping to good use.

151
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,470
侯默的脖子
Homer's neck?

152
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:22,790
不  他根本没脖子  有更好的用处
No. He doesn't have one. Something better.

153
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,340
把右手放低一点  能更有力
Lower your right hand. Gives you more power.

154
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,220
谢谢
Thanks, um...

155
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,220
保拉  帕蒂的朋友

是个有趣的爱好
That is a fascinating hobby.

167
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,830
伐木运动不止是个爱好
Timbersports is more than a hobby.

168
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,590
是你在业余时间付出的没有回报的激情
It's an unpaid passion that you do in your spare time.

169
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,630
现在  咱们去树林里
Now, we're going to the woods.

170

现在  为了激励你砍木头
Now, to motivate your chopping,

177
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:38,620
想象那些让你生气的东西
think of things that make you mad.

178
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,340
没什么能真的让我生气

我的遗言是丽莎是个小辣鸡
My final words are Lisa sucks!

183
