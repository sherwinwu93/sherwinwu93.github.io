19
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,160
Thanks for hosting.

20
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,750
How was the sleepover?

21
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,140
They each had a 5-Hour Energy drink and a jar of Nutella

22
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,440
and then watched Russian dashcam videos all night.

23
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,770
Vodit' znachit ubivat'!

24
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:19,850
Listen, Marge.

25
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,080
Every year, Kirk and I rent a luxury villa in Costa Rica

26
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,300
and invite a few select families to join us.

27
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,760
Maybe you've heard about it?

28
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,900
I've always dreamed of being invited on this trip,

29
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,130
and now it's about to happen.

30
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,330
Play it cool, Marge, like only you can.

31
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,940
Let me see.

32
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,030
Costa Rica...

33
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,360
Nope, nope.

34
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,600
Sorry, it's news to me.

35
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,490
We were wondering, would your family

36
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,150
be interested in joining us?

37
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,920
When would you need an answer by?

38
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,600
Oh, the sooner the better.

39
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,330
Costa Rica!

40
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,680
Costa Rica!

41
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,390
Time to rock and...

42
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,110
Costa Rica!

43
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,750
Costa Rica! Costa Rica! Costa Rica...!

44
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,930
Costa Rica.

45
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,320
Family meeting!

46
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,380
Right now!

47
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,140
The Van Houtens invited us

48
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,260
on their super-exclusive multi-family vacation

49
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,710
to Costa Rica!

50
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,440
We'll stay in a luxury villa right on the beach...

51
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,220
...near pristine rain forests,

52
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,420
home to five percent of the species on Earth...

53
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,330
Biodiversity!

54
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:40,180
...in a land where it's normal for kids to carry machetes.

55
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,420
Legalize it!

56
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,390
And you can chew on the guidebook.

57
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,930
I've always dreamed of being the kind of family

58
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:50,560
that other families would be willing to do things with.

59
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,340
Costa Rica!

60
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,400
- Costa Rica! - Airport food court!

61
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:56,710
- Airport food court! - Costa Rica!

63
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,610
Now, that's a tympanic membrane that just won't quit.

64
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,130
Whoa. This trip's gonna cost how much?

65
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,470
I know it's expensive,

66
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,750
but we spend our whole lives worrying about money.

67
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,660
That's because we don't have that much.

68
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,240
We have a mortgage, a reverse mortgage.

69
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,430
I think the house is owned by the car.

70
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,330
Life is about experiences.

71
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,590
Look at this photo the Hibberts posted from last year's trip.

72
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,500
Now look at my feed.

73
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,590
Yeah.

74
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,190
Oh, boy.

75
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:34,960
I want a photo of you and me by that waterfall.

76
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,200
The hope of going on this trip is the only reason

77
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,370
I've allowed Bart to stay friends with Milhouse.

78
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,110
Now I understand everything.

79
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,180
Homie, I know it's a stretch,

80
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,700
but if Kirk and Luann can afford it...

81
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,130
Yeah. He can't earn that much.

82
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,390
His job is moving the Topless Maids van

83
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,390
so they don't get parking tickets.

84
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,280
Let's have one damn fling and hope everything will be okay.

85
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,240
You know what? You are right.

86
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,470
I am sick of being the responsible one in this marriage.

87
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,960
Let's live life.

88
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,090
Remember, we can never be poor

89
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,590
as long as we have each other.

90
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,120
Oh... yes, we can.

91
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,760
You know, what if we stayed home

92
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,770
and just did puzzles of Costa Rica?

93
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:25,490
I mean, this trip sounds really expensive.

94
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,960
- No, not really. - What? No!

95
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,980
You just let the grown-ups worry about grown-up things, okay?

96
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,270
Your mom and dad

97
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,760
have our financial future all under control.

98
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,560
Ooh! Free ticket!

99
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,180
The rich get richer!

100
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,550
Ah, the multi-family vacation.

101
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,120
Let's see who we've got.

102
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,270
The Van Houtens, of course. The Hibberts.

103
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,860
Superintendent Chalmers and his daughter.

104
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,990
I can't believe my father is tearing us apart

105
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,820
for a whole week.

106
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,700
Sweetie, it's a very long flight.

107
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,710
Why don't you save your phone battery.

108
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,950
All you care about is batteries!

109
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,840
You've never been in love.

110
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,680
Your mother and I had a very...

111
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:10,520
Never mind.

112
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,140
Yep, not one person here

113
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,530
I'd mind spending an extended period of time with.

114
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:19,130
I didn't have time to wax, so I'll do it on the plane.

115
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,860
What the hell is that doing here?

116
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,630
Well, Lou the cop and his sister were gonna go,

117
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,270
but a billboard fell on him

118
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,830
and her wind chime store burned down.

119
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,590
So I suggested Patty and her new girlfriend.

120
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,670
You deliberately hid this from me

121
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,670
until it was too late to back out.

122
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,810
- Yes. - Don't try to deny it.

123
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,720
Patty's new relationship really has to work out,

124
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,490
because the dating apps won't take her anymore.

125
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,080
All I ask is that you're nice to them.

126
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,920
Evelyn, this is my husband Homer.

127
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,940
A very polite hello to you, madam.

128
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,130
Well, well, Homer Simpson.

129
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,380
I've heard so much about you.

130
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,390
Surely you have, but in my defense,

131
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:03,080
urinating on a privately owned merry-go-round

132
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,610
is not public urination.

134
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,030
Okay, who wants Miguelitos?

135
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,600
Now, I should warn the newbies--

136
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,470
these will seem very authentic to you.

137
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,820
This stuff is pura vida in a glass.

138
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,480
What's pura vida?

139
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,830
Uh, it means "pure life."

140
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,990
Kind of a state of mind down here.

141
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,340
Very chill.

142
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,020
Like what you think of as chill

143
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,630
but, like, a million times chiller.

144
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,320
Homie, I think I'm having an experience.

145
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,990
Every time a fruit meets a booze, a magic vacation is born.

146
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,800
Well, you can try.

147
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,010
Oh, boy, I didn't know that.

148
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,690
So true.

149
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,290
Rodrigo, Rodrigo, mi hermano,

150
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,170
put the bill on this.

151
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,820
Nothing is less pura vida than check-splitting.

152
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,680
On this trip I pay for everything up front--

153
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,640
food, the villa rental,

154
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,100
cloud forest murder mystery--

156
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,460
and I keep track of 'em right here.

157
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,400
Then we settle up at the end.

158
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,850
Smokey Blandings is putting on

159
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,210
a cornhole clinic tonight.

161
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,990
And this is where fatigue really sets in, Jim.

162
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,020
When you're tossing that fourth beanbag,

163
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,070
your muscles are screaming, son.

164
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,040
Good heavenly days!

165
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,730
You also follow the pro cornhole tour?

166
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:05,560
Sure do. I used to play on my daddy's farm.

167
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,460
We'd toss bags all day,

168
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,230
even when it was hotter than a two-dollar pistol.

169
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,350
That is hot.

170
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,440
Do you always speak in such colorful Southern-isms?

171
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,580
Does a mama possum skip church on Sundays?

172
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,870
I bet she does.

173
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,080
Homer, put your phone away.

174
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,470
Evelyn, please.

175
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:36,080
Evelyn, you don't want to go shopping with us?

176
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,210
It's a vacation, sugar bear.

177
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,380
We should be lying on the beach like a lost flip-flop.

178
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,720
But, darling, there's nothing to do at the beach except drink.

179
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,140
You know what? Why don't you two take in the sights

180
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,360
while I chaperone your Southern señorita to the beach?

181
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,170
Well, my, my, what an elegant solution.

182
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,440
Well, I guess this way everyone's happy.

183
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,040
Tonight's dinner is amazing, folks:

184
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,260
line-caught mahi mahi.

185
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,790
The local fishermen pass the lines down from father to son,

186
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,460
so, boy, you can taste the heritage.

187
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,630
Dios mío!

188
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,140
Eh, what?

189
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,710
Oh. Hey, guys.

190
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,430
We met these awesome monkeys on the beach,

191
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,110
and we said they could crash here

192
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,840
in exchange for them being hilarious.

193
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,060
Sweetie, you did not tell me

194
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,490
your brother-in-law was such a fun guy.

195
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,460
You two should be so happy.

196
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:45,860
Your husband and your girlfriend are amigos!

197
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,690
Who's that with you, Jimbo?

198
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,490
Is that Stacy?

199
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,340
Oh, my God.

200
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,570
Jimbo is cheating on me!

201
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,030
Wha...?

202
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,940
Ok. Make-up kit. Selfie stick.

203
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,210
Oh, God, where's the selfie stick charger?

204
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,350
Honey, relax.

205
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,900
The waterfall picture's going to be fine.

206
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,700
Fine? If this photo is just "Fine,"

207
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,330
we're getting a divorce.

208
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,820
Okay, okay, that crossed the line,

209
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,080
but this is a once-in-a-lifetime trip

210
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,490
and our only shot at a perfect moment.

211
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,550
I get it-- you're mad about my awesome monkey party.

212
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,100
But you wanted me to be nice to Patty's girlfriend,

213
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,140
and guess what. She's cool.

214
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,900
Just what you need, another drinking buddy.

215
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:37,220
Just promise me you'll behave for the rest of the trip.

216
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,610
Okay, okay. I will stay far away

217
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,840
from Patty's fun Southern girlfriend.

218
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,990
Or as she would say,

219
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,570
"Further away than a fat-cheeked boy

220
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,710
from a porch full of grannies."

221
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,640
Run, fat boy, run!

222
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,540
Why are you freaking out?

223
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,670
Shouldn't you be in the jungle kissing a boa constrictor or something?

224
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:05,790
This trip is so expensive, and Mom and Dad don't care,

225
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,480
so I'm practicing sleeping in a car

226
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,890
for when we lose the house and have to sleep in our car!

227
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,500
Well, Milhouse's dad writes down

228
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,600
how much money everyone owes in that book,

229
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,130
so all we have to do is snag it,

230
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,690
then show Mom and Dad the numbers.

231
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:21,060
Yes! That'll snap 'em out of their financial insanity.

232
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,780
You up for a little breaking and entering?

233
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,110
Break into a grown-up's bedroom?

234
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,330
Whoa, big move.

235
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,190
Okay, we'll do it when everyone's on the hike.

236
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,220
But how do we get rid of Milhouse?

237
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,370
Not a problem. Milhouse already ditched me

238
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,810
for Dr. Hibbert's kid.

239
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,960
His "Vacation friend."

240
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,140
Hey, JJ, do you still like Legos?

241
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,900
- Uh... not really. - Me neither.

242
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,680
Lego sucks!

243
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,870
Hey, JJ, why don't we put on a play for the grown-ups tonight?

245
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:57,560
Ooh, sweetie, look, a "Flowers of Costa Rica" scavenger hunt.

246
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,120
I wonder how many we can find together?

247
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,980
Just braid, Daddy!

248
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,130
I need to look super hot to win back Jimbo's heart.

249
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,500
Darling, you're experiencing so many emotions for the first time.

250
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,510
And that's very healthy, but...

251
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,930
He strayed because of you!

252
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:18,990
Hey, JJ, one time my friend got a temporary tattoo

253
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,440
but told his dad it was real.

254
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,620
Okay, let's steal that ledger.

255
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,790
What's that thing?

256
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,800
Grappling hook made of Patty's underwire bra

257
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,560
and Dad's bathing suit drawstring.

258
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,910
Will it reach?

259
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:44,370
This is so weird, being in another grown-up's bedroom.

263
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,730
Boy, you're telling me. He doesn't even work out.

264
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:52,460
Uh, I don't want to learn anything else about this family.

265
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,020
It's too late.

266
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,420
All right, bottled water break.

267
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,190
I can drink from the stream.

268
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:05,300
After all these years, my gut biome is simpatico

269
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,220
with the local bacteria.

270
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,420
Ugh! Oh, God, there's something moving inside me!

271
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,570
Oh, look out! Oh, look out!

272
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,250
Look out, I said look out! Look out!

273
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:22,400
Oh, God, no simpatico! No simpatico!

274
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,660
Hey, Homer. You want a hit off this?

275
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:29,470
Oh, Evelyn. You and I both love secret day drinking,

276
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,700
but I promised Marge I'd have a bad time

277
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,420
the rest of this vacation.

278
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,400
I hear exactly what you're saying.

279
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,630
Did you find the ledger?

280
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,560
No, but take a look at this.

281
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,720
These are stone spheres

282
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,450
made by the extinct Diquis people of Costa Rica.

283
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:58,370
No one knows what they were for, but they're priceless artifacts.

284
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,620
So what is Milhouse's loser dad doing with them?

285
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,250
Oh, I'm sorry, Kirk's tum-tum.

286
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,020
Daddy drank some ick-ick.

287
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,130
Oh, the rumblies are coming.

288
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,660
The rumblies are coming!

289
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,560
They're here!

290
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,420
If we get this photo right,

291
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:26,390
this multi-family vacation will be worth every penny.

292
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,910
You're so cute when you're super controlling.

293
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,280
You've been drinking.

294
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,460
Well, maybe Evelyn added

295
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,270
a little Southern charm to my water.

296
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,100
That woman! She brings out the worst in you!

297
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,650
Look!

298
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,240
Oh, my God.

299
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,670
It's perfect.

300
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,640
You look good, and I look better.

301
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,700
Post it. Post it.

302
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,330
Homer!

303
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,090
Buddy, hi. Watch me do a Savannah Polecat Flip.

304
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,000
No!

305
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,020
Come back, camera fish!

306
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:17,550
All I wanted was for my friends to be jealous of me.

307
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,190
I hope you're happy

308
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:22,160
now that that bald gorilla has dragged my girlfriend down

309
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,620
to his pathetic level.

310
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,570
Patricia Maleficent Bouvier,

311
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,550
I've put up with you criticizing my husband for years,

312
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,900
and I've had it.

313
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,420
Evelyn got Homer drunk.

314
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,520
Evelyn ruined my dream photo.

315
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,440
She's the bad influence.

316
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,050
That's ridiculous.

317
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,950
She may be Southern, she may be a woman,

318
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,580
but you're dating a Homer.

319
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,100
Oh, no.

320
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,420
Mom, look what I found in the Van Houtens' room!

321
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:59,420
They are smuggling these artifacts home to sell!

322
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,760
That's how they can afford this vacation.

323
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,160
But we can't.

324
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,970
And we're gonna have to live in our car,

325
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:08,340
and the seats in our car are sticky,

326
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,080
even though they're cloth!

327
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,340
You're... you're so gross.

328
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,790
It's so gross.

329
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,180
Salt... and pepper.

330
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,180
These souvenirs were supposed to be

331
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:23,590
our end-of-multi-family-vacation gift to you all.

332
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,780
Way to spoil the surprise.

333
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,690
Not very pura vida.

334
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,950
Not very pura vida at all.

335
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,560
Stacy and I are finished.

336
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,510
Shauna Chalmers, will you marry me?

337
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,820
Oh, my God!

338
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,450
Jimbo proposed!

339
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:43,990
We are getting freaking married!

340
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,050
Ooh, You guys are sneaking off early.

341
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:55,780
Don't you want to come ziplining and ruin the trip some more?

342
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,090
Well, I would...

343
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,740
like to agree with my wife that it's better we leave.

344
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,640
I'll give you the final bill now so we can settle up.

345
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,980
No discount for leaving early either.

346
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:10,550
I may be mucho pura vida, but, uh, I'm not a sucker.

347
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,620
Lisa was right.

348
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,950
We really couldn't afford this trip.

349
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,560
Ooh, that's a big number.

350
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,770
How's Patty? I haven't seen her.

351
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,000
I don't know what happened.

352
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,890
She... broke up with me.

353
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,450
I know you feel bad, Mom,

354
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,670
but the lady is a Homer.

355
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,210
Oh, all that money,

356
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,280
and we didn't even get the picture.

357
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,200
Look at this.

358
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,480
Mr. Van Houten even charged us

359
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,050
for those salt and pepper shakers.

360
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,950
He said those were a gift.

361
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,010
And he didn't even give them to us.

362
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,160
Then we're not leaving without them.

363
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:21,210
Oh, so that explains it.

364
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,120
Gotcha.

365
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,150
Can't you let us even zipline in peace?

366
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,060
Look what we found hidden in your bedroom.

367
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,900
This is a portrait of explorer Kirkedemious Van Houten,

368
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,560
who settled this area for a Dutch cracker-trading company,

369
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:45,350
and he built this house, which your family still owns.

370
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,880
You're charging us thousands of dollars in rent

371
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,040
for a house you get for free.

372
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,130
The Van Houtens are cheating all of us,

373
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:55,180
so we pay for their vacation.

374
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,620
- I'm stunned. - I'm shocked.

375
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,800
I'm Shauna.

376
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,180
I'm just as surprised as any of you.

377
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,310
Oh, what?! Come on!

378
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,340
This scam was her idea.

379
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:09,220
And this year she even charged you more

380
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,470
so we could pay for our "Intimacy coach."

381
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:14,430
I mean, how many things can you do with a feather?

382
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,310
Oh, easy, guys, easy.

383
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,950
Everyone try to remain pura vida. Huh?

384
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,430
I'm gonna pura vida my foot in your ass

385
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,150
if you don't give me back my money.

386
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,770
He's zipping away!

387
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:31,060
Stop him before he endorses those checks!

388
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,230
So, you and Evelyn broke up?

389
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,900
I thought you really liked her.

390
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,880
I did, but now all I see is Homer, thanks to you.

391
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,180
Patty! Come back!

392
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,520
I can't! Because I'm on a zipline...

393
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:51,040
Patty, I'm sorry I upset you,

394
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,130
but Evelyn is your Homer,

395
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,320
and no one else will ever understand why you love her,

396
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,590
except for you.

397
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:00,420
But there's one huge difference between them.

398
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,040
I'm listening.

399
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,730
Evelyn loves you,

400
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,640
and Homer hates you more than anything in the world.

401
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,590
Even more than he hates Selma?

402
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,060
He feels sorry for Selma,

403
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,310
because she has to live with you.

404
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,210
Hold on, Evelyn!

405
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,800
I'm coming!

406
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,580
Go ahead, take your money.

407
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,950
Take away a man's only source of income.

408
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,600
No, it's real classy.

409
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,510
We just got a free vacation.

410
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,320
Hooray!

411
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:37,530
Now let's charter a helicopter back to the waterfall

412
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:40,160
to get your mom's precious picture.

413
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,470
No, no, no. It's okay.

414
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:47,350
Vacations aren't about the perfect photo.

415
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:51,180
It's about being in the moment and living your... vida.

416
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:57,700
They're as cute as two bugs in a rug.

418
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,610
Honey, I just want you to know

419
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,760
that Jimbo Jones is a fine young man,

420
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,570
and I'm very happy for you two to be married.

421
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,720
- Truly. - Yeah...

422
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,890
Jimbo's parents freaked out and canceled the wedding.

423
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:22,960
Whatever.

424
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,210
I'm glad somebody's setting limits.

425
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,700
You know, pumpkin, I'm doing my best.

426
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,040
Do you understand that?

427
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,630
That as a single father, it's not always so easy

428
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,650
to balance guidance with respect for your...

429
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,310
Yeah...

430
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,280
Yeah, now we're connecting, huh?

431
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,490
Why can't we just leave?

432
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,480
'Cause we have to clean up before Uncle Pete gets here,

433
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,430
or we'll lose our week next year.

434
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,130
Hey, hey, this stuff is expensive!

435
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,210
Comprende?

436
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,410
No, amigos, no, no.

437
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,330
No, pura vida!

438
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,340
Pura vida!

439
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,230
Oh, no! No bueno!
