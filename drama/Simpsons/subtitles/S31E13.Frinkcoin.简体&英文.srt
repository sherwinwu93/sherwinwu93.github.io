00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,840
这样他们就不可能注意不到我了
so they couldn't help but notice me.

86
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,160
但是我一直没有突破

为了让加密货币发挥作用
For cryptocurrency to work,

105
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,230
我们需要记录下所有的交易记录

这些被记录在分布式账本里

123
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,360
这就是"区块链"
That's the "blockchain."

124

00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,430
我很懂区块链
Oh, I know all about blockchain.

160
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,720
再说一次  不是您想的那样
Again, not what you're thinking.

161
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,620
这种新货币是由付教授研发的
This new currency has made Professor Frink

162
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,030
他现在是春田镇的首富
the richest man in Springfield.

163
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,650
等下  你是说我不再是镇里最有钱的人了
Wait. Are you saying I am no longer the richest man in town?

164
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,980
我想是的  老蒙
I'm afraid not, Monty.

165
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,010
你竟然敢叫我老蒙
You have the gall to call me Monty?

166
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,470
你吃了我的饭
Just because you chew my food

167
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,720
就想对我直呼其名吗
makes you think we're on a first-name basis?

168
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,000
当然不是  先生  我再也不会了
Of course not, sir. I'll never do that again.

169
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,470
我现在要用餐了
I will have my dinner now.

170
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,500
焗烤龙虾
Lobster Thermidor.

171
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,230
开始吃吧
Start chewing.

172
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,270
但是  先生  我对壳类海物过敏
But, sir, I-I'm allergic to shellfish.

173
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:01,300
我不过敏  韦兰德
And I'm not, Wayland.

174
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,930
投进了  你看见了  投进了
It went in-- You saw it. It went in!

175
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,790
你好  教授
Hi, Professor.

176
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,250
你刚刚收获名声和财富
I wanted to see how you're enjoying

177
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,290
我想看看你享受得怎么样
your newfound fame and wealth.

178
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,340
我能告诉你的是他没有投资除臭剂行业
He hasn't invested in deodorant. I can tell you that much.

179
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,380
第一笔一千万我要偿还学生贷款
Well, the first ten million went to pay off student loans.

180
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,340
奇怪  真奇怪
S-Strange, strange.

181
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,640
我终于拥有了一直渴望的名声和财富
I have the fame and fortune I've always desired and yet,

182
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,710
然而我就像杜瓦真空瓶一样空虚
I'm-- well, I'm as empty as a Dewar vacuum flask.

183
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,850
现在也许是时候好好照顾自己了
Well, maybe it's time to take care of yourself now.

184
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,940
有什么东西是你一直想要的
What are the things that you've always wanted?

185
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,280
我想想啊  我一直想要一支笔
Oh, let's see, I've always wanted one of those pens

186
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,690
其中有四种不同的颜色
with the four different colors.

187
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,860
我自己做了一套
I fashioned one myself, but it's, uh,

188
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,470
但是这个不太轻便
it's a tad bit unwieldy.

189
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,680
{\an8}呆子

190
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,660
你现在可以得到比这更多的东西
You can get those pens, and so much more.

191
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,860
他们为他的鼻音装上发明消音器了吗
Do they make a silencer for his constant nasal whistle?

192
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,040
你知道吗
Well, you know what?

193
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,990
你再也不用听到我鼻子嘶嘶的声音了
You will never have to worry about my adenoidal hiss again.

194
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,970
我还是能听见
I can still hear it!

195
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,460
他远在芝加哥  我的天呐
He's in Chicago, for God's sake!

196
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,430
老谋子  丽莎要帮我付酒吧的费用
Moe, Lisa has offered to pay my bar tab.

197
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,430
你接受付临客币支付吧
You do accept Frinkcoin, right?

198
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,770
除了阿尔巴尼亚列克币其他方式我都接受
I'll accept any currency except the Albanian lek.

199
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,650
我把全部身家都换成了它
I sunk everything I had into it,

200
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:27,320
{\an8}阿尔巴尼亚货币单位

201
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:27,320
我现在连两个昆塔都拿不出来
and now I ain't got two qindarkas to rub together.

202
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,280
但是付临客这个人  他肯定会成功的
But that Frink, man, boy, he's sure got it made.

203
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,180
我现在很想知道他正在做什么
Yeah, I wonder what he's doing now.

204
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,940
我说了我想知道他现在正在忙什么
I said I wonder what he's doing now!

205
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,050
{\an8}付临客家

206
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,360
请进
Yes, come in.

207
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,290
你更幸福了吗
So, are you happier?

208
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,670
我得到了一切想要的东西
No. No-- I got everything I wanted.

209
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,880
还有笔  但我还是很难过
Even the pen. But I'm-I'm still sad.

210
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,620
好可怜
Aw, poor guy.

211
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,290
什么  只是亚马逊快递  别紧张
What? That's just Amazon delivery. Calm yourself.

212
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,810
爸爸  你应该见过可怜的付教授了吧
You should have seen poor Professor Frink, Dad.

213
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,060
可怜  他可是镇里最有钱的人
Poor Frink? He's the richest guy in town.

214
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,690
但是他在最重要的事情上并不富有
But he's not rich in the most important thing there is.

215
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,710
健康吗
Health?

216
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:08,530
好了
Oh, yeah.

217
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:11,150
不  最重要的是朋友
No. The most important thing is friends.

218
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,110
爸爸  你应该带付教授去老谋子那里
Dad, you should take Professor Frink to Moe's.

219
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,550
我做不到
Oh, I can't do that.

220
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:18,200
这就像接待你妈妈的姐妹们过来拜访一样
It's like having your mother's sisters come for a visit.

221

带付临客去老谋子那了

行吧  但这游戏我们玩很久了

但是  如果这个方程式被解开了

所有数字硬币将变得一文不值

00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,230
天啊  难道说
Oh, my, could it be that they're,

360
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,590
他们只是一群吸血鬼吗

00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,320
难道我没有真心朋友吗

我的计划是这样的  史密瑟斯
Here's my plan, Smithers.

383
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,670
我们把方程式放在这
We put the equation here.

384
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:42,540
明天之前  足智多谋的群众会帮我们解开的
And the ingenuity of crowds will solve it for us by tomorrow,

385
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:46,550
这样所有的电子货币就会一文不值
thus rendering all cryptocurrency worthless.

386
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,630
要是他们解不出来呢
Well, what if they don't?

387
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,800
别担心  史密瑟斯
Don't worry, Smithers.

388
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,430
实在不行我就去找耶鲁的校友们帮忙
If this doesn't work, I'll get some of my old Yale buddies in.

Well, they're dead and their children are dead, sir.

天啊

真有人能解开这个吗

407
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,650
教授你好
Hey, Professor.

408
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,780
我等不及要在贵宾看台
Boy, I can't wait to sit in the skybox

409
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,030
观赏今晚的大赛了
for the big game today.

410
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,740
我要全程吃炸鸡和爆米花顾不上看比赛
I'm gonna have chicken and popcorn and never watch the game.

411
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,660
不好意思  计划有变
Well, I'm so sorry, change in plans.

412
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,660
没订到贵宾看台的票
You see, the skybox wasn't available,

413
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,990
我买了普通票
so I got regular tickets.

414
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,950
我突然想起来
Oh, that reminds me.

415
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,500
我得去医院切个囊肿
I need to have a cyst removed.

416
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,960
现在是最佳时机
Now's as good a time as any.

417
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,040
我得去病床边上说"别醒过来"
Yeah, and I got to be there to say, uh, "Do not resuscitate."

418
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,610
是"快醒过来"
Do resuscitate!

419
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,780
我得记下来
I really should write that down.

420
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,400
{\an8}别醒过来

421
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,430
好吧  实验还没有结束
All right, now, now, the experiment is not yet complete.

422
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,710
再观察一下
Let's just see here.

423
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,460
被你笑死了  教授
Oh, Professor, you kill me!

424
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,230
从没听过这么疯狂的胡言乱语
I never heard such a crazy bunch of nonsense talk.

425

所以这次  你们当中
So... this time, would one of you

430
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,500
就这样吧  从现在起
Well, that's it, from now on,

431
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,380
我坚持认为我唯一的同伴就是人工智能了
my only company will be A.I., I insist.

432
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,840
我第一个独立想法就是
My first independent thought is

433
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,660
我讨厌你
I dislike you.

434
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,640
谢天谢地你把我叫醒了
Oh, thank God you woke me.

435
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,600
我在做一个可怕的噩梦
I was having a terrible dream.

436
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:07,690
关于什么的
Oh, about what?

437
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,760
我做过的所有恶事
All the awful things I've done.

438
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,690
我知道你晚餐时不该吃第二颗蓝莓
I knew you shouldn't have had that second blueberry at dinner,

439
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,320
不过这才是我带你来的原因
but this is why I brought you.

440
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,490
看  有人在白板上写出了答案
Look, someone posted a solution on the whiteboard.

441
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:17,980

Frink is ruined!

442
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,580
太好了  这问题被戳个正着
Yarr, this problem has been speared in the head,

443
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,460
拖上甲板  切得七零八碎
hauled on the deck, and sliced up the guts,

444
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,670
从数学角度来讲
eh, mathematically speaking.

445
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,950
所以是谁想出了答案呢
So, who found the solution?

446
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,090
是我写的吗
Did I do it?

447
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,290
不
No...

448
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,050
我想我们无从得知了
I guess we'll never know.

449
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,560
重要的是我又一次
The important thing is that once again,

450
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,810
成为了镇上的32000人之中
I am the richest man

451
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:45,840
最富有的那个
in a town of 32,000 people.

452
