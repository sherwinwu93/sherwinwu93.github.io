其包裹的爆炸声打破了圣诞节的氛围
had his jingle bell rung in a package deal gone boom.

223
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,440
我们唯一的线索就是尸体旁边的缩写
Our only clue is these initials next to the corpse.

224
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,440
他不是尸体  还喘气呢
He's not a corpse. He's breathing.

225
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,380

你没有权利做决定
you don't get a vote.

228
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,700
缩写指的是戏子鲍勃
"S.B." is Sideshow Bob!

229
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,240
这就是他的目标
That's what he's up to.

230
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,120
他在偷走圣诞节
He's stealing Christmas!

231
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,370

你为什么不去《时空怪客》剧组呢
Why don't you just Quantum Leap there?

239
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,880
你为什么不学学怎么当警察呢
Why don't you learn how to be a cop, fatso?

240
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,190
我喜欢  像《错误身份》

241
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:12,770
我卖了十张季票给我牢房里的人

248
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,890
我告诉你圣诞老人村恐怕已经关闭了
And as for you, Santa's Village is closed, I'm afraid.

249
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,260
如果我想听你的人生故事  我会选择优步
If I wanted your life story, I would've taken an Uber.

250
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,830

Well, that shuts me up.

251
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,750
{\an8}圣诞老人城堡

252
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,940

我妈把我爸关门外雪地里挨冻

256
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,200
他现在一直在敲我窗户
He keeps tapping at my window.

257
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,910
我妈警告我开窗就没礼物
She said if I open it, no presents.

258
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,980
-真没用  -别挂电话啊

259
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,500
{\an8}我的计划

260
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,070
典型的邪恶反派错误

262
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,960
人生目标吗

263
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,760
别嘲笑我啊
Don't pooh-pooh.

264
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,050
你自己说  我该怎么说服自己
Now for God's sake, how can I convince you

265
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,370
不去杀了你
that I am not going to kill you?!

266
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:24,760
找到偷礼物的人
Find the person who stole the presents.

267
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,220
好吧  首先要澄清我姓名首字母之罪名
Very well. I shall begin by clearing my initials,

268
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:31,100
去捉那个真"S.B"  最后

出发
Let's roll.

275
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,390
坐副驾驶要掏过路费
Shotgun means you pay the tolls.

276
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,920
我是来拯救圣诞的  计划是这样
So I'm here to save Christmas, and here's my plan.

278
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,720
你从哪学的这手
Where'd you learn how to do that?

279
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,580
坐小丑车横越全国  你也能学好几手
When you ride cross-country in a clown car, you learn a lot.

280
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,020

292
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,370

296
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,600
什么时候要先说史密瑟斯了
Since when does Smithers go first?

297
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,980
你们被拆穿了
The jig is up!

298
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,130
然后  我腿麻
Also, leg cramp.

299
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,320
警察马上就到
The police are on their way.

300
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,360
他们会信你们  还是会信一个送给他们
Who will they believe? You or the billionaire

301
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,240
蒙哥马利沃德公司的奶酪的亿万富翁
who just sent them a Montgomery Ward's cheese log?

302
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,160
伯恩斯先生  您为什么要做这些
Mr. Burns, why did you do this?

303
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,120
守财奴基本操作
Ooh, general Scroogeyness.

304
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,440
不  更内在  守财只是外表
No, it's deeper. It's much deeper than that.

305
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:01,290
我认为伯恩斯先生很沮丧
I think Mr. Burns is depressed.

306
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,160
你真是个有洞察力的好姑娘
Ooh, you're a very perceptive girl.

307

圣诞老人撒谎
Santa lied.

341
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,570
老蒙  你误会我了
But, Monty, you misunderstood me.

342
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:51,200
圣诞老人  这不可能
Santa? It can't be.

343
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,160
老蒙  现在是1935年
Monty, it's 1935,

对对对  我又是个孩子了

事实真相是  你的父母很爱你
And the truth is, your parents did love you,

352
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,930
但不是以亲亲抱抱的方式  而是更好的方法
not with hugs and kisses, but with something better--

353
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,430
他们让你成长为一个坚强的人

354
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,850
你们那个年代的其他大亨们都怎么样了

357
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,090
都归功于你父母深沉的爱
thanks to your parents' love.

358
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,140
你说得对
It's true.
