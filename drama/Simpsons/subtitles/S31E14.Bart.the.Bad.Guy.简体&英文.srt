我可以让星球浴火重生
I can restart this planet in flames,

22
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,220
如同乌托邦
as a utopia.

23
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,470
说不好啊奇诺斯  你说"乌托邦"
I don't know, Chinnos. You say "utopia,"

24
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,260
我听到的是"杀光所有人"

而我真的不想再找个新的干洗店

不会拯救你的  镁镁侠
will not save you, Magnesium Man.

28
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,980
但它的确分散了你的注意力对吧  怪老爹
Yeah, but it did distract you, didn't it, Dad Bod?

29
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,430

00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,500
原来它叫水晶之战
It was called Crystal War

39
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,630
是因为他们都变成了水晶
because they were all turned to crystals.

40
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:53,300
现在不是你做冷酷的分析的时候
Hey, now is not the time for your cold-hearted analysis.

41
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,930
续集明年才出
The sequel isn't coming out for a year.

42
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:58,930
是何等慈爱的上帝才会让我们等这么久

55
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,960
仅仅口头警告是不够的
Instead of a merely verbal warning,

56
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,260
我明白更具威慑力的是
it's clear to me a more effective deterrent

57
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,970
将这个特技的视频展示给你们看

00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,970
继续请付费
the next is gonna cost you.

157
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:12,250
我盯那本《凌晨三点博士》漫画很久了
I've had my eye on that Dr. 3 A.M. graphic novel.

158
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,560
做好准备  故事的发展是
Okay, strap yourself in. The way it goes down is...

159
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,020
先等等  你将要说的话
But pause. The knowledge you offer

160
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,960
会剧透本年度盛事电影
would spoil the movie event of the year.

161
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,520
不  本世纪
Nay, century.

162
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,130
不  本时代
Nay, epoch.

163
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,340
不  所有夏天
Nay, summer.

164
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:26,820
一个字也别说了
Tell me nothing.

165
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,760
但我快被好奇心吞噬了
Ah, but my curiosity consumes me.

166
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,820
那好我接着说  电影开头的标志是...
All right, here's the deal, the movie starts on the logo...

167
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,490
闭嘴
Silence!

168
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,810
你说
Speak!

169
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,650
别说了
Speak not.

170
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,310
详细点
Expound!

171
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,960
我通过了考验  我可以
I pass the test. I will diminish

172
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,440
无欲无求做回漫画男
and remain Comic Book Guy.

173
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,610
哦  虾
Ooh, shrimp.

174
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:53,410
你愿意为拒绝知道剧情付出什么代价
What would you give me not to find out what happens?

175
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,420
滚吧  剧透小子
Be gone, Spoiler Boy.

176
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,130
剧透小子
Spoiler Boy.

177
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:00,880
我喜欢
I like that.

178
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,360
就是他看了守护者联盟 水晶战争2 复活
That's the kid who saw Vindicators: Crystal War 2: Resurgence.

179
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,030
听他话不然会被剧透
Do what he says or he'll spoil the ending.

180
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,600
我必须守护耳朵的处女听
I must protect my virgin ears.

181
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,710
我觉得还能再来点
I think you can do better than that.

182
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,000
每人四个鸡块
Four chicken lumpettes per person.

183
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,300
即使这个人知道是哪个守护者在对抗
Even if that person knows which Vindicator

184
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,920
空手道蝎子时用去了大家三分之一的力量吗
loses a third of their powers fighting Karate Scorpion?

185
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,720
闭嘴  这电影在两元影院上映后
Zip it. My boyfriend's taking me to see that movie

186
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
{\an8}首轮电影下档后  以折扣价格放映

187
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,000
我男朋友会带我看
when it gets to the two-dollar theater.

188
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,600
{\an8}取消午餐

189
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,190
辛普森  你每多吃一块鸡块
Simpson, you're getting one day of detention

190
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,880
就多留校一天
for every extra lumpette you eat.

191
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,360
留校吗
Detention, is it?

192
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,610
那我们就有大把时间去讨论
I guess we'll have plenty of time to discuss

193
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,270
你最爱的守护者黑伏都的命运了
the fate of your favorite Vindicator, Black Voodoo.

194
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,330
{\an8}属于美国路易斯安那州新奥尔良街区
伏都教在新奥尔良很流行

195
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,330
法国区守护者总部的冠军
The champion of the French Quarter.

196
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,790
赌你不敢剧透
You wouldn't dare spoil the only thing

197
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,500
全世界唯一能带给我快乐的电影
that brings me joy in this world.

198
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,860
把你的假发给我
Give me your toupee.

199
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,110
什么假发
Toupee?

200
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,250
我可没戴假发
I don't wear a toupee.

201
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,620
那我们从波旁街说起吧
We fade in on Bourbon Street...

202
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,620
{\an8}美国新奥尔良法国区一条著名古老街道

203
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,930
{\an8}守护者联盟

204
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,770
史金纳校长  什么风把您吹来了
Principal Skinner. T-To what do we owe the honor, sir, at-

205
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,290
是你呀
Oh, it's just you.

206
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,810
这些东西哪来的
how'd you get all this stuff?

207
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,480
因为我说什么人们就做什么
'Cause people do whatever I say

208
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,820
否则我就剧透《守护者联盟》
or I spoil the Vindicators movie for them.

209
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,730
比如说
Like so:

210
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,860
让妈妈同意我用汽水泡麦片
tell Mom it's okay for me to have soda on my cereal.

211
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,320
我不确定  你妈不会答应的
I don't know. Mom's not gonna go for that.

212
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,280
好  那就准备好被剧透大结局吧
Okay. Get ready to hear the surprise ending.

213
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,640
让我猜猜  正义战胜了邪恶
Let me guess. The good guys win.

214
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,330
谁告诉你的
Who told you?

215
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,790
你没法给我剧透那电影
You can't spoil that movie for me,

216
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,540
因为我根本不在乎
because I don't care what happens.

217
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,290
作为一个成年人
You see, as a grown-up,

218
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,920
我早看透了穿着紧身服的超能力肌肉男们
I know that muscle jerks in tights with magic powers

219
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,920
拳打脚踢之后又深情拥抱
punching and hugging each other

220
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,880
都是哄小孩的瞎扯
is boring BS for babies.

221
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,850
剧透吧  告诉我摆设队长对拉链什么侠的
So go ahead, tell me what Captain Doodad does

222
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,180
做了什么
to Zippity whoever.

223
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,460
因为那根本没意义
Because it means nothing.

224
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,750
我的剧透力对你不起作用
My powers don't work on you.

225
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,800
但如果我能让剧透力为你服务呢
But what if I could make them work for you?

226
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,680
我喜欢这险恶的语气
Your sinister tone intrigues me.

227
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,780
今天的酒我请客
All-you-can-drink beers on me!

228
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,780
老谋子买单
But paid for by Moe.

229
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:25,440
我已经懒得表示惊讶了
All right, I'm not even gonna dignify that with a "Whaaa?"

230
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,790
上  小子
Do the thing, boy.

231
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,540
别  别 千万别剧透
No, no, don't ruin it, kid!

232
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,210
我还要等档期排到两元影院时
I'm taking my girlfriend to that movie

233
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:34,200
带我女朋友去看呢
when it gets to the two-dollar theater.

234
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,670
你昨晚几点回来的
What time did you get home last night?

235
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,600
这不能怪我
it's not my fault.

236
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,170
巴仔用他的剧透力给我带来太多酒水
Bart used his superpower to get me drunker than I've ever beer.

237
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,770
我担心这样勒索别人
I'm worried that all this blackmail

238
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,470
正在让巴仔学坏
is turning Bart into a bad person.

239
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,410
早上好啊  宝贝们
What's the story, morning glories?

240
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,750
巴仔  我不喜欢你用剧透的手段
Young man, I don't like the way you're using those spoilies

241
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,940
去指示别人
to boss people around.

242
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,830
哪有  我被赋予了一项超棒的能力
What? I was given an amazing power,

243
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,130
所以就用了呗
so I'm using it.

244
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,300
如果是你也会这么做的
If you were in my suitcase, you would do the same thing.

245
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,720
粉丝们深爱漫宝电影宇宙
Fans have a deep connection to the Marble Cinematic Universe.

246
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,660
我是不会利用这一点的  无论如何
I would never exploit that, not for anything.

247
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,880
是吗
Wouldn't you?

248
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,350
{\an8}校园舞会
在星光里尬舞
春田小学

249
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,240
丽莎·辛普森  我想你的超能力
Lisa Simpson, I think your superpower

250
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,220
一定是偷心吧
must be stealing hearts.

251
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,640
你现在对利用的看法如何呢
How do you feel about exploitation now?

252
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,190
存在即合理吧
It's okay.

253
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
这场逗傻子的滑稽剧
How much longer do I have to keep up

254
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,130
我还得演多久
this kookaburra charade?

255
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,750
看你有多不想让你漫宝影业的老板们知道
How badly do you not want your bosses at Marble Studios

256
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,530
我利用了你这个醉肥仔看了那部电影了
to know that I used your drunken thumb to see that movie?

257
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:05,180
你把我当成你的"快乐流浪汉"了是吧
You think I'm your jolly swagman, do you?

258
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:06,800
{\an8}此处引用了澳大利亚丛林民谣《丛林流浪》的歌词

259
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,850
没关系  我的小羊
Well, my jumbuck's gonna be free

260
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,890
{\an8}《丛林民谣》讲述了一位快乐的流浪汉
在把一只偶遇的羊塞进旅行袋后
因遭到警察的追捕而投河自尽的故事

261
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,890
在下周四就能从你的旅行袋里解放出来了
from your tucker bag next Thursday,

262
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:12,940
等到那部电影登上每一张大银幕
when that movie goes wide on every screen in creation.

263
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,880
那之后  你就什么都不是了
And after that, you're nothing.

264
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,550
让我们继续嗨到派对结束吧
Let's get this party finished!

265
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,530
他说得对
He's right.

266
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,700
我快没时间了
I'm running out of time.

267
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,770
这是...终局之战了
This is... endgame!

268
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,460
{\an8}生日快乐
老苏茜

269
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,540
今天我们迎来了我们最爱的橡树
And so, today, we celebrate the 200th birthday

270
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,500
老苏茜的200岁生日
of our beloved oak tree, Old Susie.

271
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,840
她庄严枝干所带来的阴凉惠泽我们镇上的婚礼
Her stately branches have shaded our town's weddings,

272
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:41,530
家庭聚会  以及那个...额...
family reunions, and quincen-- quincien--

273
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,530
{\an8}墨西哥的女孩成人仪式
市长想说的词是Quinceañera

274
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,260
{\an8}市长最终说出来的Bar Mitzvahs是犹太教的男孩成人仪式

275
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,260
墨西哥版的犹太成人礼
Mexican bar mitzvahs.

276
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,700
我们呢...
We're, uh, ow!

277
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,810
把耳朵捂住  是剧透男孩
Cover you ears! It's Spoiler Boy!

278
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,390
没错  就是我
That's right. It's me.

279
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,350
如果你们不想被剧透
And if you don't want the movie spoiled,

280
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,400
你们就得一起给我建一座
you'll all pull together and build me

281
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,650
我设计的梦中树屋
the ultimate tree house of my own design.

282
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:01,180
就在这老苏茜上
Right here in Old Susie.

283
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,240
不能建在老苏茜上啊
Not in Old Susie!

284
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,160
镇上的每个人都爱这棵树
Everyone in this town loves that tree!

285
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,990
我们没有选择
We have no choice.

286
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:12,200
我们都完完全全被他玩弄在鼓掌之中了
He's got us all by the short and curlies.

287
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:16,780
除非在这个孩子身上发生了一些不幸的意外
Unless the boy should meet with an unfortunate accident.

288
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,920
如果有任何可疑的事情发生在我身上
And if anything suspicious should happen to me,

289
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,420
我已经雇了镇上嗓门最大的人去每个街角
I've hired the loudest man in town to yell the ending

290
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,340
把电影结局吼出来了
on every street corner.

291
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,050
我准备好啦
I'm on it!

292
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,940
{\an8}剧透

293
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,890
你们有24小时时间来建我的树屋
You have 24 hours to build my tree house.

294
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,370
时间可不等人哦
The clock is ticking.

295
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,190
伙计  你出院了
Hey, buddy. You're out of the hospital.

296
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,150
别跟我来这套
Don't you "Hey, buddy" me.

297
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,650
空射侠来看望的是我不是你
You stole my visit from Airshot.

298
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,490
你是反派
You-- you villain!

299
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,120
我是反派  怎么可能
Me, a villain? No way.

300
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,160
你勒索了全镇的人帮你造藏身之所
You just blackmailed the whole town to build you a lair.

301
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,710
好吧  我向你保证这件事
Okay. I will grant you the optics on the lair

302
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,080
进行得并不理想
are less than ideal.

303
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,960
你把力量都用在邪恶的事上
You have actual powers which you use for evil.
