When I didn't take a Ritalin?

159
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,510
-你太残忍了  -别说了
- You monster. - Hush.

160
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,830
你如果什么都没钓到  我们今晚就没东西吃
If you don't catch something, we don't eat tonight.

161
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,010
愚蠢的垂钓
Stupid fishing.

162
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,820
愚蠢的平静
Stupid peace and quiet.

163
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,350
愚蠢的日落
Stupid sunset.

164
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,890
这里绚丽多彩
Thinks it has so many colors.

165
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,500
非常的美丽  金光灿烂
So beautiful and bright and golden and...

166
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,980
看看你的鱼竿  巴仔  鱼咬钩了
Mind your line, Bart. You got a nibble.

167
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,250
我抓到了  抓到了
I've got it! I've got it!

168
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,890
我亲手杀了一条鱼
I murdered a fish. Me, by myself.

169
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:48,980
别太骄傲  孩子
Don't get cocky, son.

170
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,090
你还要清理一下鱼然后吃掉
You've still got to clean it and eat it.

171
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,490
首先  我们要生火
First things first, we got to start a fire.

172
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,270
用什么生火
Uh, with what?

173
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,070
我们自己动手来成就自我
We'll build character by building it ourselves.

174
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,720
该你了
Your turn.

175
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,790
我手好疼
Oh, my hands hurt.

176
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,490
我们是有童工法的
There are child labor laws, you know.

177
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,320
这是最笨蛋的
This is the most idiotic...

178
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,630
-你感觉如何  -很好  为什么会这样
- How do you feel? - Great. But why?

179
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,290
这就叫做成就感  孩子
Well, it's called "Accomplishment", Son--

180
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,710
是一个靠你自己努力赢得的
something you've earned yourself

181
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,560
别人夺不走的东西
that can never be taken from you.

182
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,910
左撇子握手
Left-handed handshake.

183
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,290
既然你现在已步入正轨
And now that you're on your way,

184
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,130
没人知道你还能多优秀
there's no telling how far you'll go.

185
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:34,920
*奇异恩典*
*Amazing grace*

186
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,140
*何等甘甜*
*How sweet the sound... *

187
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,080
我的天呐
Oh, my goodness.

188
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,440
我们的儿子从来不会那样唱歌
Our little boy could never sing like that before.

189
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,450
我觉得他唱的不怎么好
Well, if you ask me, he's not doing so well now.

190
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,180
令人惊讶
Mm. Remarkable.

191
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,260
我以为让巴仔变成小天使的唯一办法
I thought the only way to turn Bart into a little angel

192
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,400
是弄断水上乐园的电线
was a downed power line at a water park.

193
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,670
你一定很自豪
Ah, you must be so proud.

194
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,750
你成功让那孩子改邪归正了
You really turned that boy around.

195
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,070
过奖了
Oh. Well...

196
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,540
恭喜你
Congratulations,

你太棒了  内德
You the man, Ned.

200
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:10,290
你们不能把所有的功劳都归于他
Hey, you can't give him all the credit.

201
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,100
是我们先把他教坏的
We're the ones who messed him up in the first place.

202
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,800
听着  愚蠢的弗兰德斯

我是来表达谢意的
I just want to say thank you,

204

要是有什么我能帮上忙的...
and if there's anything I can do for you...

205
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,560
首先  你可以不要再叫我
Well, for starters, you could stop calling me

206
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,550
愚蠢的弗兰德斯
"Stupid Flanders."

207
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,550
开始了开始了
Oh, here we go.

208
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,490

谢谢  弗兰德斯
Thank you, Flanders.

210
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,910

他正在胡子后面偷笑呢
He was laughing under that mustache.

212
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,530
你们在这里干嘛
What are you doing here?

213
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,460
巴仔在做数学作业
Bart's actually doing math homework.

214
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,540
我想亲眼看看
I wanted to see it for myself.

215
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,490
等一下下
Bup-up-up-up!

216
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,540
听着  我能辅导我自己的孩子
Listen, I can help my own kid.

217
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,210
我想想看
Uh, let's see.

218
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,030
四又三分之二加六分之五等于
Four and two-thirds plus five-sixths equals,

219
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,820
算一算
uh, uh, carry the math...

220
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,920
然后...
And, uh...

221
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,860
惨了  作业被狗吃掉了
Oh, no! The dog ate it!

222
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,950
问题不大  我已经做完了
It's okay, Dad. I finished it.

223

在弗兰德斯先生的帮助下
With Mr. Flanders' help.

224
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,910
看起来我没什么用处了
Well, it looks like I'm useless.

225
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:16,910
让我带着最后一点尊严离去吧
Let me just walk away with my dignity.

226
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,000
{\an8}又肥又没用

227

我的儿子不爱我
My son doesn't love me.

231
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,900
{\an8}[西语]你现在很难过  但你的儿子是欣赏你的

232
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,970
{\an8}等他长大了  他会懂得尊重你

233
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,670
你根本没听懂我说了啥
You don't get me at all.

234
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,400
{\an8}春田垃圾场

236
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,440
你不应该一个人在这里

我住在拖车里  轮胎都是瘪的

我最后一口干粮是一块冰块

244
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,190

245
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,790
还能借此机会报复巴仔
Which I could use to get back at Bart.

246

该理发时我就躲在灌木丛后

247

没人知道答案
Nobody has the answer to that.

衣服都扔到前院吗

这就是我们的蓝图  孩子们

快看我教会谁骑车了

对  但他不会发出酷炫的摩托车的声音

我来帮你骑上去

我又不是来拯救世界的

我教导你
I was only mentoring you

372
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,940
只是为了惩罚我儿子变得如此优秀
to punish my son for becoming a better boy.

373
