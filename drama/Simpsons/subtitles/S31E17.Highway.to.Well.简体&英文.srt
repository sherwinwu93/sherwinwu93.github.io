你好  不好意思我们迟到了

你好阿麦  之后谁来接呢
Hello, Maggie. And who will be picking her up?

25
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,810
什么  她倒下之后吗
W-- A-After she falls down?

26
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,830
不是  放学之后
No, at the end of the day.

27
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,810
慢着  我不能陪读吗
Wait, I don't stay with her?

28
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,390
研究表明超前儿童
Research shows pre-toddlers learn best

29
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,360
在没有家长在场的情况下学得最好
in a parent-free environment.

30
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,180
除非你想阻碍她成长  那也很好
Unless you want to stunt her growth, which is great.

31
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,220
我们不能评判的
We're not supposed to judge.

32
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,900
不不  不是这样的
No, no, it's not that.

33
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,920
我只是不想阿麦觉得自己被抛弃了
I just don't want Maggie to feel abandoned.

34
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,590
那四点见了
So, we'll see you at 4:00.

35
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,730
好吧
Oh. Okay, then.

36
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,090
今天接下来我该干什么呢
Hmm. Now what will I do with the rest of my day

37
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,330
我知道了  我问问最爱的妈咪博客
I know. I'll ask my favorite mommy blog.

38
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:54,560
{\an8}这就对了妈咪
照顾好你自己

39
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,870
{\an8}上一节动感单车课吧
老妹儿

40
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,370
现在把阻力加到最大
Now turn that resistance all the way up!

41
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:02,130
加把劲  我想看你们这帮臭女人受苦受累
Come on! I want to see you bitches suffer!

42
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,330
难道只有我一个人听到这句话了
Am I the only one who heard that?

43
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,290
我爱死了
I love it.

44
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,190
就好像听着脑海里的声音接受训练
It's like being coached by the voice inside my head.

45
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:13,710
往死里练  你们这群活在陆地上的海牛
Spin yourselves to death, you land manatees!

46
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,470
{\an8}用陶艺来表达你一无是处的自我吧

47
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,920
卖力画  长着香肠手指的没用东西
Paint harder, you sausage-fingered no-talents!

48
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,080
{\an8}给你工作中的男人一个香艳惊喜

49
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,060
"给你工作中的男人一个香艳惊喜"
"Sex-prise your man at work."

50
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,700
你来干嘛
What are you doing here?

51
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:36,330
也许你可以给我来个安全检查
Maybe you could give me a safety inspection.

52
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,060
我的天  我真是不敢相信
Oh, my God, I can't believe this is happening.

53
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,380
我完全被香艳惊喜到了
I'm so sex-prised!

54
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,900
这里到处都有摄像头
There's security cameras everywhere,

55
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,710
所以我们得偷偷地躲在桌子下
so we'll have to snuggle under the desk.

56
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,590
请直接在桌子上
On top of the desk, please.

57
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,150
谢了杰瑞  干得真漂亮
Thanks, Jerry! Nice. Real cool.

58
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,950
现在我该怎么打发时间
Now how do I fill the day? Hmm.

60
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,780

It's pronounced "Well and Good."

62
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,020

Ugh, why is everyone talking to me?

80
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,820
这钱包是什么颜色的
What color is the wallet?

81
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,160
马姬·辛普森  其实并没有什么测试
Marge Simpson. There was never a test.

82
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,900
除非这一直都是测试
Except there always was.

83
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,750
-没有吗  -而且你通过了

00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,740
好了  现在我在这工作了
Okay, so I work here now.

90
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,490
还没问我们卖什么
I never asked what we sell.

91
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,970
我可以搞清楚
I can figure this out.

92
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,640
糖果  爆炸浴盐  喷灯
Candy? Bath bombs? Blowtorches?

93
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,840
30块一瓶的苏打水
$30 bottles of soda?

94
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,190
不好意思
Excuse me.

95
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,460
你建议我买酊剂还是油
Do you recommend the tincture or the oil?

96
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,470
我...我猜酊剂可能更贵吧
I-- the-the tincture is more expensive, I guess.

97
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,590
这事关你自己
Look, this is about you.

98
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,490
我觉得  要照顾好你自己
And taking care of you. I think.

99
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,890
所以你要把自己...放在第一位
So you have to put yourself... first?

100
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,900
你朴实无华略显笨拙的销售策略
Well, your no-frills, fumbling sales pitch

101
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,000
已经打动了我  我两种都买
has won me over. I'll take both. Yes...

102
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,200
姑娘  你刚刚卖出了一百块
Wow, girl, you just made a hundred-dollar sale.

103
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,870
你一定非常适合这里
You're gonna fit in great here.

104
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,170
问题是  这里卖什么
Thing is, what does here sell?

105
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,220
现在要玩RadioShack那一套吗
Is this what RadioShack is now?

106
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,040
不  我们是一家高端大麻精品店
No. We're a high-end cannabis boutique.

107
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,880
你们卖大麻
You sell pot?!

108
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,750
准确地说  我负责检查身份证
Technically, I check I.D.s.

109
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,240
你卖大麻
You sell pot.

110
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,980
我是个毒贩子
I'm a drugs dealer!

111
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,740
现在在本州  大麻已经合法了
Cannabis is legal in this state now.

112
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,550
水橇也合法
Well, so is water-skiing,

113
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,720
但这并不意味着我就要去卖它
but that doesn't mean I have to sell it!

114
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,300
抱歉
I'm sorry.

115
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,180
马姬  不要离开  我是认真的
Marge, don't leave, seriously.

116
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,390
我请求你
Like, I'm asking.

117
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,710
德里克·塔图姆  我有你的台面式烤架
Drederick Tatum! I own your countertop grill.

118
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,270
尽量不要在不粘表面上使用金属器具
Take care not to use metal utensils on the non-stick surfaces.

119
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,850
但是  在我的拳击生涯结束之后
But anyway, after my boxing career ended,

120
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,360
我非常痛苦
I was in a lot of pain.

121
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,180
具体地讲  痛在我出拳的手
Specifically, in my punching hands

122
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,450
还有我被拳击的脸
and my blocking face.

123
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,020
但是服用了大麻油
But following a regimen of CBD oil

124
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,530
以及皮卡丘烟枪的药效
and medicinal hits from a Pikachu bong,

125
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,670
我又能够享受生活了
I was able to enjoy life again.

126
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:51,290
因此激励了我创立了很好&非常好康复商场
Which inspired me to create Well and Good Healing Emporiums.

127
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:55,090
电影里的切齐和钟才吸大麻呢
But pot is for Cheeches... and Chongs.

128
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,660
马姬  这不是为了爽
Marge, it's not about getting high.

129
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,760
这关系到人们的身心健康
It's about wellness.

130
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,850
这就是为什么我在这里聘用了优秀的团队
And that's why I've hand-picked the perfect team here.

131
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,230
我是大麻成分和最新配售系统的专家
I'm an expert in cannabinoids and cutting-edge delivery systems,

132
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:09,320
又叫浸煮器  脱羧基  皮下吸收和宠物栓剂
aka infusers, decarboxylators, transdermals and pet suppositories.

133
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,050
而我很性感
And I'm super hot.

134
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,660
你们要我做什么
And what do you need me for?

135
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,630
马姬  大家知道你想伸出援手  这里很安全
Marge, people know you want to help them, that it's safe here.

136
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:19,360
{\an8}1980年上映的美国喜剧电影

137
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:19,360
你之前说  不像《喜剧二人组》里的情节
Not some place for Cheeches and Chongs, as you so recently put it.

138
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,610
非常抱歉  我不认为这是真实的自我
Uh, I'm sorry. I don't think this is really me.

139
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,220
祝你的生活方式好运
Good luck with your lifestyle.

140
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:28,820
没有治疗感情受伤的药物真遗憾
Oh, it's a shame there's no drug for hurt feelings.

141
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,590
在这里呢
Oh, wait, there totally is.

142
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,700
{\an8}伤感情药品

143
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,040
你知道吗  在一些家庭里他们围坐在一起
You know, in some families, they go around the table

144
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,750
每人都要说一件当天的见闻
and everyone says one thing they learned that day.

145
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,590
我知道了这个
Okay. I learned that.

146
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,450
我知道了前重量级拳击手世界冠军
Well, I learned that the former heavyweight champion

147
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,980
拥有一家大麻商店
of the world owns a marijuana store.

148
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,340
他提供给我一份工作  被我回绝了
And he offered me a job, which I turned down.

149
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,410
等下  什么
Wait, what?

150
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,710
这些人真的很优秀
I mean, the people were really cool,

151
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,240
他们认为我很优秀
and they thought I was cool,

152
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,910
这让我感觉很振奋
which made me feel "Stoked."

153
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:04,780
但是我不想成为一名大麻销售员
But I'm not going to be a reefer saleslady.

154
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,040
我认为这没什么不妥的
Well, I guess there's nothing wrong with it.

155
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,570
在这个州大麻是合法的
Cannabis is legal in this state.

156
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,950
这和你在卖酒的地方工作没什么两样
Yeah, it's basically the same thing as working in a liquor store.

157
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,710
你能在卖酒的地方工作吗
You can work in a liquor store?

158
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,270
别做梦了  伙计
Stay with us, big guy.

159
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,940
我以为你们会反对这件事
Wow. I thought you'd be opposed to it.

160
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,950
现如今人们压力很大
People are stressed out these days.

161
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,330
坏血病卷土重来  世界战火纷飞
Scurvy is back, there's, like, 60 wars going on.

162
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:30,750
鲸鱼正在吃掉我们宝贵的海洋塑料
Whales are eating our precious ocean plastic.

163
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,420
也许人们需要一根大麻烟
Maybe people want to smoke a doob for that.

164
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,990
是啊  现在所有人都把垃圾卖给瘾君子
Oh, yeah, everyone's selling crap to stoners now.

165
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,510
你看过阿壳汉堡店的广告了吗
Have you seen the new Krusty Burger commercial?

166
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,540
{\an8}此处也指吸毒之后的饥饿感

167
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,540
出于某种原因  当你找到零食的时候
When you've got the munchies, for some reason--

168
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,840
你那极度渴望的眼神
wink, wink-- you crave weird.

169
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,770
油炸牛肋排配上热乎的甜甜圈
A deep-fried rib-wich served on a warm doughnut.

170
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,870
还有意大利面夹心的奶酪三明治
Or a spaghetti-filled grilled cheese sandwich

171
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,100
淋上农场布丁
drizzled with ranch pudding.

172
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,590
阿壳能让您大饱口福
Krusty's Munchie Mouthfuls.

173
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,160
是时候来尝尝了
It's high time you tried it.

174
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,670
你懂了吗  懂了吗
Get it? Get it?!

175
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:06,860
懂了吗
Get it?

176
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,430
我懂了
I get it.

177
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,070
塔图姆先生亲自选了我
Well, Mr. Tatum did personally choose me.

178
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,550
他说我很乐于助人
He said I was helpful.

179
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:18,140
亲爱的  你是我见过最喜欢帮忙的人
Honey, you're the most helpful person I've ever met.

180
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,770
去卖那合法安全的毒品吧
Now go sell the safe legal drugs

181
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:24,040
当然孩子们绝对不能碰
our kids should never, ever use!

{\an8}大麻软糖

185
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,990
这是个苹果零售店吗
Is this an Apple store?

186
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,790
进来的每个人都这么问
Everyone keeps asking that.

187
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,340
我关节炎发作  把手机摔地上了
I dropped my phone because of my arthritis.

188
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,010
我们不修手机
We can't fix your phone,

189
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,630
但我可以帮你缓解关节炎
but I can sure help with that arthritis.

190
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,820
试试这瓶神奇止痛乳液
Try this amazing pain-relieving lotion.

191
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,990
有些刺痛
Oh. It tingles.

192
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,610
和采婷牌不一样  我恨采婷
Not like Jergens. I hate Jergens!

193
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,840
你看起来压力很大
You seem stressed. Hmm.

194
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,340
要来点儿美味软糖吗
Why not try some yummy gummies?

195
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,440
{\an8}很好&非常好康复商场

199
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:10,180
这个大人物可是一整所学校的校长
This big shot here is the principal of a whole school!

200
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,280
给她秀秀你的钥匙串

201
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,780
爱了爱了
Oh, I love it.

我想来点大麻
Psst. I want to buy some pot.

203
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,800
别急别急  短裤仔
All right, pump the brakes, Jhorts.

204
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,950
我得先问你几个问题
Got to ask a few questions first.

205
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,680
你是想全身麻
Now, do you want a body high

206
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,230
还是就脸上麻一点
or a front-of-the-face buzz?

207
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,050
无所谓  随便哪个都行
I don't know. Just hook me up.

208
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,960
我知道你想要什么了
Mmm, I have the perfect strain in mind.

209
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,560
但悠着点用
But be warned, boo,

210
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,720
用了这款你整个人会瘫掉起不来
the couch-lock is strong on this one,

211
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,180
但优点是不会有记忆丢失
but there's, like, zero mind earse.

212
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,720
你在扯什么  我只是想要点...
W-What are you saying? I just want...

213
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,080
大麻
weed.

214
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,970
别急  马上就好  听我说完
Okay, almost there. Almost there. Now listen.

215
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,650
你是想要大麻粉末
Do you want this in flour...

216
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,150
浓缩液  还是外用的
...shatter, topical...

217
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,950
内服的  还是鼻喷雾剂
...edible, nasal mist...

218
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,040
滴耳剂
...ear drops?

219
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,280
我只是想从一个不管是不是警察的人手上
Look, I just want to score a bag of shwag

220
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,380
买一袋最普通的大麻
from some dude who may or may not be a cop.

221
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,330
我是个警察
I'm a cop.

222
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,640
你试过这个吗
Have you tried this?

223
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,160
这一切都说不通了
Nothing makes sense anymore!

224
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,920
给我瓶啤酒
Give me a beer.

225
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,420
啤酒不会让我的头发有烟味儿
It doesn't make my hair smell like anything!

226
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:26,020
我一辈子都盼望着大麻合法化
I dreamed my whole life of legalized weed.

227
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,990
结果原来这么扫兴
Turns out it's a real buzzkill.

228
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,370
可不是嘛
Ain't that the truth?

229
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,770
时代变了
Times have changed.

230
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,090
酒精带来的浪漫感已经逐渐消逝了
The romance of alcohol is fading into the past.

231
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:37,520
瘾君子们永远不会知道坐在马桶上
Stoners will never know the joy of sitting on the toilet

232
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,540
然后吐到自己内裤里的乐趣
and barfing into your own underwear.

233
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,340
或者是和比你壮两倍的人打架
Or picking a fight with a guy twice your size

234
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,920
因为他走路蹭到你的车了
because his leg touched your car.

235
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,110
我也怀念过去的日子
Yeah. I miss the old days, too.

236
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:50,930
那时候找大麻...又阴暗又艰难
When buying pot was... scuzzy.

237
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,140
为了回到过去  我愿意付出任何代价
I'd pay anything to turn back that clock.

238
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,460
你知道现在什么会受欢迎吗
You know what'd be popular?

239
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,130
如果这些合法的地方
If one of those legal places

240
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,010
能打造成好像在通过以前学校老关系
made it feel like you were scoring weed

241
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,820
偷偷吸毒品的感觉
from your old-school pot connection.

242
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,170
这个主意很棒  我们应该这么做
That's a great idea, and we should do it.

243
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,800
那些老烟枪们
Those tie-dyed bong monkeys

244
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,870
会为这些玩意付出大价钱
will cough up big-time for the full dirtbag shebang!

245
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,860
我去告诉那些老烟枪们
I'll alert the bong monkeys.

246
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,910
绅士们下午好  来点泡沫吗
Afternoon, gernts. You need some suds?

247
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:21,100
达夫超人知道大家需要达夫啤酒提神醒脑
Duffman knows it's always time for a refreshing Duff!

248
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:22,710
没错  我们听说
Yeah, that being said,

249
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,560
巴里有时候也想找点草药类提神醒脑的东西
sometimes Barry is looking for a little herbal refreshment.

250
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,310
懂我意思吗
Know what I mean?

251
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,100

So you guys friends of Moe?

253
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:38,490
对  他们很酷
Yeah. Uh, these guys are cool.

等等  有个免责声明
Oh, wait. Here's a disclaimer, man.

256
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,420
这里是一个合法药房
"This is a legal dispensary,

257
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,260
遵循所有法律法规
"Compliant with all laws and statutes.

258

259
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,240
演员们会假装这些事是不合法的
cast members may pretend it's illegal."

260
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,180
好吧  开始吗
All right. Shall we?

261
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,830
疯狂的鸟  生锈的杠铃
Hmm. Crazy bird, rusty free weights,

262
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,430
所有东西闻上去都像湿乎乎的泳衣霉味
everything smells like a damp swimsuit...

263
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,850
我到家了
I'm home.

264
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,520
你演的是谁
Who are you supposed to be?

265
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,540
从不认可你的怪朋友
I'm the weird friend who never acknowledges you.

266
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,820
我以前是这么对待老室友斯考特的
I was that guy for my old roommate Scott.

267
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,040
放在邦迪的盒子里就行
Just stick it in the Band-Aid can.

268

马姬  我在想由你来担任

287
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:13,130
作为很好&非常好品牌的实际代言人
acting as the de facto face of the Well and Good brand.

288

天哪  为何是我
Oh, my God. Why me?

马姬  因为大家信任你
Well, Marge, 'cause people trust you.

290

296
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,690
但不幸的是  大麻这事有个煞风景的人

297
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:37,240
你的丈夫侯默在卖大麻  马姬

等下  我也是  我们都在卖

我们在努力美化大麻制品的形象

00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:54,290
他知道我靠卖大麻提高了多少自尊心
Oh, he knows how much self-esteem I get from selling bud.

303
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,360
那是我们的好飞盘
And that's our good frisbee.

304
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,260
要是你丈夫把大麻带回2018年的黑暗时刻
I'm afraid that you cannot continue with this company

305
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:03,490
恐怕你就没办法继续在这公司工作了
while your husband is taking pot back to the dark ages of 2018.

306
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,670
-我很抱歉  -不  不  不要
- I-I'm very sorry. - Oh, no. No, no, no.

307
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,570
请不要炒了我
Please, please don't fire me.

308
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,520
我想成为你们的门面
I want to be your face.

309
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,580
等侯默知道他这样有多伤害我
When Homer realizes how much this is hurting me,

310
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,760
我相信他会明白的
I'm sure he'll understand.

311
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,730
我不明白
I don't understand.

312
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,620
我们做的是一样的  顶多你穿得像医生
We're doing the same thing, except you dress like a doctor,

313
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,890
我穿得像是很酷的小孩
and I dress like a cool toddler.

314
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,180
你不懂吗
Don't you get it?

315
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,780
我是治愈者  你是致郁者
I'm a healer, and you're a dealer.

316
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,030
你得停手了
You need to quit.

317
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:31,540
我什么时候想停就停  我就不想
I can quit whenever I want. I just don't want to.

318
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,930
我嫁的你不是日常半途而废吗
What happened to the quitter I married?

319
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,370
我放弃半途而废了
I quit quitting!

320
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,940
-怎么回事  -妈妈爸爸在毒品战争
- What's going on? - Mom and Dad are having a drug war.

321
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,360
-有什么差别  -而且你花了一千块
- It's not different! - And you spent $1,000...

322
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,080
因为我  美国广播公司更有意思了
I make CNN much funnier!

323
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,080
{\an8}《辛普森一家》曾预言特朗普当选总统

00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,000
侯默不肯放弃
Homer wouldn't quit.

327
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,460
这是我的工作服  大麻仓库的钥匙
Here's my smock, my key to the hash register,

328
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,690
写着合伙人的工牌
my business card reading "Associate."

329
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:57,960
我没法当公司的门面
Instead of being the face of the company,

330
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,460
我就只是我了
my face will just be me.

331
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,610
等下  马姬  还有个办法可以挽回工作
Wait, Marge. There is one way to save your job,

332
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,240
但是这样就要你背叛你的丈夫
but it would entail the betrayal of your husband,

333
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,530
我绝对不会要求你这么做的
which I would never ask you to do.

334
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,660
说说也无妨
Well, I mean, it doesn't hurt to ask.

335
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,990
只要有你帮忙  我们能让政府让他关门
With your help, we can get the government to shut him down.

{\an8}卫生局

341
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,020
我没懂  侯默犯了什么罪
I don't understand. What crime is Homer committing?

342
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,310
大麻是合法的
Pot's legal.

343

没错  但他没有执照

如果他给了顾客零食  而他们

哪怕只吃了一口  我们就进去逮捕他
even one bite, we go in and take him down.

347
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,980
所以我们需要你进去  用这个下套
So we need you to bait the trap with these.

348

我很抱歉跟你吵架了
I am so sorry about our little tiff.

354

你会接受这份道歉礼  让你和朋友们分享吗

355
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,670
亲爱的  你总是站在我这边

我有世上最深情  最支持我  最忠诚的妻子
I have the most loving, supportive, loyal wife in the world.

357
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,930
如果辛普森一直这么吃下去
If Simpson keeps eating like this,

358
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,790
还没等其他人上钩他就吃光了
he'll hit bottom dust before anyone takes the bait.

359
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:29,460
你这个死胖子  给你的顾客吃点芝士球
Come on, you fat bastard, offer the customer some cheese balls.

360

我们得丢掉这东西
We got to get rid of the stuff.

368

那你为什么从不抽大麻
why have you never tried pot, ever?

397
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,660
医生需要亲自试试胰岛素
Well-- does a doctor need to try insulin

398

我可能是对它没反应的人之一
I'm probably one of those people it doesn't work on.

同时升降的电梯上
that's going up and down at the same time.

412
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,750
这不对劲  你说过这是健康产品
Something's wrong. You said this was about wellness,

413
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,280
但我感觉嗨了
but I feel high.

414
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,600
好了  好了  听着
Okay, okay, listen.

415
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,990
你要明白的是
What you need to understand is this,

416
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,090
我也嗑嗨了
I'm high, too!

417
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,550
我宁静得不得了
I'm Serenityed out of my gourd.

没错  宝贝
Yeah, baby.

419
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,180
我得冷静下来  我得吃点东西
I've got to come down. I've got to eat something.

那是鸡肉馅饼[大麻饼]
Um, that was a chicken pot pie.

421
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,110
不  我吃了可食用大麻制品
Oh, no. I ate an eatable.

422
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,920
你用大麻纸巾擦了嘴
And you just wiped your mouth with a Hash-nap,

423
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,620
这是最强劲的产品
the most potent thing here.

424

我平时都是这么走路的吗

00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:34,490
可能我也怪异了  你就不会觉得那么怪异了

438
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:37,270
来  我抽一根你的未来主义烟卷
Here, I'll smoke one of your futuristic joints.
