What Freud is almost universally acknowledged as a profoundly important intellectual figure.<br />
He's also the object of considerable dislike.<br />
This is in part because of his character.<br />
He was highly ambitious in the cause of promoting psychoanalysis,<br />
&#xa0;often dishonest, sometimes brutal to his enemies<br />
&#xa0;and sometimes particularly brutal to his friends and his students.<br />
More important that is the content of his views.<br />
At the time, he was seen as a sexual renegade out<br />
&#xa0;to destroy the conception of people as good and rational people.<br />
When the Nazis rose to power in the 1930's,<br />
&#xa0;Freud was seen as a Jew who was attempting to<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;single-handedly destroys some of the most cherished notions of Christian morality.<br />
Now, to some extent, many people see him this way,<br />
&#xa0;and to some extent this accusation has some truth to it.<br />
<br />
Freud told us things about ourselves that are immensely uncomfortable<br />
&#xa0;and some things that many of us would rather not know.<br />
So, what did he say?<br />
Well, if you ask someone who hates Freud, they'll talk about the sillier stuff,<br />
&#xa0;and in fact Freud said a lot of things and some of them were wacky at the time,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and many of them certainly did not survive the verdict of scientific history.<br />
Many of his ideas were simply silly.<br />
Possibly the dumbest thing he ever said,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;which is something which many people think of him and associate with his name,<br />
&#xa0;is the idea of penis envy.<br />
So, penis envy is an account of a developmental progression.<br />
The idea is that at some point in her development,<br />
&#xa0;a little girl discovers that she doesn't have a penis.<br />
For her, this is a catastrophe because she infers, according to Freud, that she was castrated.<br />
So, she turns to her father to get a penis substitute<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;because he has a penis and rejects her mother who's equally unworthy,<br />
&#xa0;and Freud calls this process the Electra complex.<br />
Now, if that's all you know about his work,<br />
&#xa0;if you think about Freud in terms of penis envy, or phallic symbols,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;or kind of pop interpretation of dreams,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;you won't have the highest opinion of him.<br />
<br />
But at the root of Freud's work is a set of ideas of immense importance and significance<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that are worth taking very seriously,<br />
&#xa0;and very broadly these are the ideas of unconscious motivation,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that there're unconscious reasons for your feelings and actions<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;as well as the notion of unconscious dynamics.<br />
That you are not one entity, you are many entities<br />
&#xa0;and the clash of these different systems inside your mind, inside your brain<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;has all sorts of consequences leading among other things to dreams, to errors in speech,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;the sort of jokes you make and what you find funny, and often and in some cases to madness.<br />
Now, certainly Freud wasn't the first to believe in unconscious motivations,<br />
&#xa0;unconscious reasons, unconscious dynamics.<br />
You could find a lot of the same ideas in many scholars and elsewhere,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;like the plays of William Shakespeare,<br />
&#xa0;but Freud took it to an extreme and systematized it and turned it into science.<br />
<br />
The first idea, that our unconscious reasons, unconscious motivation,<br />
&#xa0;is a rejection of the common sense conception that we know what we're doing.<br />
So, suppose you fall in love with somebody and decide you wanted to marry that person,<br />
&#xa0;and suppose somebody was to ask you, "Why?"<br />
You might say something like, "Well, I'm ready to get married.<br />
It's time of my life.<br />
I really like the person.<br />
I want to make a life with that person, and so on," and maybe that's true.<br />
But a Freudian would insist that your desires and motivations that govern your behavior,<br />
&#xa0;that you might simply not know about.<br />
You might want to marry John because he reminds you of your father,<br />
&#xa0;or you want to get back at your mother for betraying you, or some other such reason,<br />
&#xa0;and if somebody was to tell you this you would deny it, and you'd sincerely deny and say,<br />
&#xa0;'No. That's not the reason.'<br />
But this wouldn't deter a Freudian.<br />
A Freudian might argue that these processes, these motivations, these reasons are unconscious<br />
&#xa0;and they happen without your awareness.<br />
Now, this idea that you don't know how your mind works,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;you don't have access to the systems<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;that give rise to your experiences, and beliefs, and actions<br />
&#xa0;is something we accept for other psychological domains,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;like language comprehension, and visual perception,<br />
&#xa0;and we'll talk about those later on in the course,<br />
&#xa0;and we'll learn,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;talk about different theories of how we come to, say, understand language or see the world.<br />
They're going to propose all sorts of things that you have no awareness of, and you'll say,<br />
&#xa0;"Okay. Well, let's evaluate these theories on their merits."<br />
But it's downright scary to assume that this sort of unconscious, unknowing system operates<br />
&#xa0;to explain the most significant choices of your life.<br />
<br />
Now, the marriage case is extreme, but there are a lot of simpler examples.<br />
Have you ever liked someone or disliked them and not known why?<br />
You just find this either a sort of powerful attraction to a person or you find a person repellent,<br />
&#xa0;but if you had to articulate the reasons you couldn't really explain them.<br />
Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you've asked,<br />
&#xa0;"What the hell am I doing here? Why am I doing this? Why did I get caught up in this?"<br />
&#xa0;and again not know the reasons.<br />
Have you ever forgotten someone's name at exactly the wrong time?<br />
&#xa0;"Yes, nice to meet you. This is my wife,"<br />
&#xa0;and wondered later, "Why did I forget that?"<br />
Have you ever forgotten an appointment?<br />
And those cases actually, they're sort of an intuitive grounding for a Freudian theory.<br />
Have you ever forgotten an appointment that you really didn't want to go to?<br />
And rather than not go to it, you just slipped your mind somehow,<br />
&#xa0;and what this suggests is there's a lot more going on in our heads that we're aware of,<br />
&#xa0;and this is what Freud called the unconscious.<br />
<br />
Now, this might be okay if the unconscious was a reasonable rational computer planning for you<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and always doing the right things,<br />
&#xa0;but according to Freud things aren't always so tidy.<br />
According to Freud, there are three distinct processes going on in your head,<br />
&#xa0;and they're in violent internal conflict.<br />
These processes are the id, the ego and the super-ego.<br />
The id is present at birth.<br />
It's the animal part of ourself.<br />
It wants to eat, and drink, and poop, and pee, and get warm and get sensual pleasure.<br />
So outrageously stupid.<br />
It works in what Freud call the pleasure principle.<br />
I want satisfaction and I want it now.<br />
The problem is the world doesn't work that way.<br />
One's desires, even as a baby, are rarely immediately satisfied.<br />
You could want milk but the mother's breast isn't there,<br />
&#xa0;and this failure of the world to give you what you want leads to a set of reactions,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;lead to a whole another system in the head called the ego,<br />
&#xa0;and the ego has some understanding of reality and logic.<br />
The ego works on the reality principle,<br />
&#xa0;which is it tries to pragmatically satisfy your desires or it suppresses them.<br />
But either way, it deals with the way the world is and how to reconcile that with what you want,<br />
&#xa0;and for Freud your ego is you.<br />
Your ego is your conscious self, and this is where consciousness emerges.<br />
It is, as you go through your day and think about things, and remember things, and plan,<br />
&#xa0;that's all your ego.<br />
Now, if that's all there was, all there was was an id and an ego, it will be a simpler world,<br />
&#xa0;but then there's the super-ego,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and the super-ego is the part of the mind that has internalized rules of parents and society.<br />
So, for instance, imagine a child who learns not to cheat in school,<br />
&#xa0;and one way to think about this is that the child learns that cheating,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;you get punished for it, you get caught, you get in trouble.<br />
That's a very ego thing.<br />
You may repress your desire to cheat because of worries about the consequences,<br />
&#xa0;but what really will happen is you come to internalize these moral rules<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;and ultimately you believe you shouldn't cheat because it's wrong to cheat.<br />
You would feel guilty or ashamed if you cheated.<br />
In other words, it's not merely fear of consequences<br />
&#xa0;but rather you develop an understanding of what's right and wrong.<br />
<br />
So, the ego then serves two masters.<br />
It's stuck between raging animal desires on the one hand, the id,<br />
&#xa0;and a sort of moral conscience on other hand, the superego.<br />
Now, it's tempting to think, as I'm framing it this way,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that the id is dumb and animalistic and the super-ego is something advanced and civilized,<br />
&#xa0;but it's not so simple.<br />
A lot of the prohibitions set up in the super-ego were setup early in development,<br />
&#xa0;and are grounded on the prejudices and beliefs of the society<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;in which you're raised, not necessarily an accurate moral understanding.<br />
So, for instance, it's very possible that you might believe, intellectually,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that some act you engage in, some sort of sexual act for instance, is perfectly fine morally,<br />
&#xa0;but your super ego, which is developed in childhood, may scream at you.<br />
As irrational as it is, it might scream at you,<br />
&#xa0;"You should be ashamed.<br />
&#xa0;That's disgusting.<br />
&#xa0;That's filthy."<br />
So, part of what we do in our life, part of what we have to struggle with<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;is the conflict between id and super-ego<br />
&#xa0;and to some extent your ego, yourself is stuck in the middle.<br />
You could see it as an iceberg, where a lot of it, it should be submerged and unconscious,<br />
&#xa0;but what we experience is mostly ego and a bit of super-ego.<br />
But a lot of what goes on into id, for Freud, is unconscious, and so desires trickle up,<br />
&#xa0;but often you don't really know what you want. You don't know what's driving you.<br />
And this is particularly the case,<br />
&#xa0;as we'll see, if these drives, these desires are somehow forbidden.<br />
