<h2 id="org02ee49f">2-1 4 Parts of the brain</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org02ee49f">
<p class="verse">
So, let's talk about the different parts of the brain and what they do.<br />
Parts of the brain are functionalized for different purposes, they do different things.<br />
Which is why damage to different parts of the brain has different effects.<br />
It's why when you look at an fMRI scan or PET scan or some something that records neural activity,<br />
&#xa0;you could figure out based on the location of the activity what's going on.<br />
So, the first thing to realize is I'm talking about the brain,<br />
&#xa0;but I'd be more precise and more inclusive<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;if I talked about the brain and parts of the spinal cord.<br />
So, you don't need your brain for everything.<br />
There're certain activities we do that can happen without a brain.<br />
Like sucking in newborns or pulling your limb back to withdraw from pain or vomiting.<br />
But for everything else we talk about in this course, we'll really be talking about the brain.<br />
<br />
So, some of the structures of the brain that are highly relevant are called subcortical,<br />
&#xa0;which means they're below the cortex, which means they're in the center of the brain.<br />
This includes part of the brain like the medulla,<br />
&#xa0;which control certain automatic function<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;like your heart rate, your blood pressure, swallowing, and so on.<br />
It includes the cerebellum, which is involved in body balance and muscle coordination.<br />
It contains about 30 billion neurons.<br />
So, this isn't small potatoes.<br />
The hypothalamus, which is involved in feeding and sex and thirst and different appetites.<br />
We're going to talk about emotions or visceral desires, we'll return to those parts of the brain.<br />
<br />
But for the aspects of psychology that are distinctive for us, that make us human,<br />
&#xa0;we're mostly focused on the outer layer, the cerebral cortex.<br />
So, the cerebral cortex it is all crumpled up.<br />
If you were to take a brain, pull out the cortex and straighten it out,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;like you're removing a rug you got from the trunk of your car and you have to straighten it out,<br />
&#xa0;it's about two feet square.<br />
So, it's lot of crumpling to get it in.<br />
It's about three millimeters thick.<br />
This is where the action is.<br />
This is where at least for the things I'm interested in, this is where it takes place.<br />
Is where reasoning and language and complex perception comes from.<br />
Fish don't have any cerebral cortex, reptiles and birds have a little bit,<br />
&#xa0;but primates, including humans, have a lot.<br />
<br />
When you look at the cortex, you'll see it has two halves.<br />
It has a left half and a right half.<br />
For each of these halves, when you look at it,<br />
&#xa0;you can demarcate the brain, the cortex into different lobes.<br />
There's going from your forehead and swooping to the back.<br />
You have the frontal lobe conveniently enough on the front.<br />
The parietal lobe, the occipital lobe, and the temporal lobe.<br />
Each of these lobes, there's different things, which we'll talk about in a bit.<br />
<br />
Another thing about the cortex though which is super interesting, is that it includes maps.<br />
What I mean by this is it includes topographical maps<br />
&#xa0;where two things that are close together in the brain are similarly close together in the body.<br />
So, there is a motor area<br />
&#xa0;where if you were to shock, parts of that brain, parts of the body would twitch accordingly.<br />
Just like you'd expect, the middle finger is close to the thumb which is closer to elbow.<br />
If it's close in the real-world and your body it's close to the brain<br />
&#xa0;and there is a primary somatosensory area, which is the sense organs.<br />
There if you have somebody in the operating table and you shocked people,<br />
&#xa0;they would experience things, they might experience a sound or a flash of light or a touch.<br />
In fact, in the occipital lobe, you have a map for vision<br />
&#xa0;and in the temporal lobe, you have a map for sound.<br />
What's really cool is, I said the map is topographical,<br />
&#xa0;but the size of the brain areas don't correspond to the size of the actual body areas,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;but rather to the extent to which there's motor or sensory function.<br />
So, artists have drawn pictures of people<br />
&#xa0;if their body was proportioned to the extent that their brain was.<br />
You'd see the trunk of the body is relatively small,<br />
&#xa0;but their hands are enormous and the face is enormous because there's a whole lot of sensation.<br />
There is much more sensation going on in your hand than in your whole back<br />
&#xa0;even though the back is physically larger.<br />
So, part of the cortex is these projection areas.<br />
But less than a quarter of the cortex contains projection areas.<br />
As I said, the rest is involved with the cool stuff.<br />
With language, with reasoning, with moral thoughts, and so on.<br />
<br />
Then the question comes in, how do we know this?<br />
How do we know what parts of the brain do what, what parts of the brain are involved, and why?<br />
There's different answers.<br />
So, one answer is we can scan the brain.<br />
We can use MRI, which is a high-frequency magnetic field, to look at the activity of the brain,<br />
&#xa0;what parts are active when people do different things.<br />
We can also look at so-called natural experiments<br />
&#xa0;when people have tumors or strokes or motorcycle accidents.<br />
In damaged part of your brain and we can ask the question,<br />
&#xa0;what damage to which parts of the brain correspond to damage to which functions?<br />
Through these different methods,<br />
&#xa0;we've learned about the different parts of the brain and what they do.<br />
We could talk about some certain specific things that can go wrong<br />
&#xa0;due to brain damage or stroke or trauma.<br />
<br />
So, for instance, there's Apraxia.<br />
Apraxia is problems of actions.<br />
So, you're unable to do an action<br />
&#xa0;like waving goodbye or picking up before or can bring some food to your mouth.<br />
You're not paralyze.<br />
You can make the movements if you have to,<br />
&#xa0;but you can't coordinate these basic movements into complex actions.<br />
<br />
There's Agnosia.<br />
Agnosia is a disorders of perception.<br />
And they're not like you can't see, but you can't recognize.<br />
Some is called psychic blindness.<br />
People of various forms of Agnosia can describe a picture in terms of it's part,<br />
&#xa0;but can't recognize the objects that are being depicted.<br />
That's a form of visual Agnosia.<br />
There's also a specific Prosopagnosia, where you can't recognize faces.<br />
Oliver Sacks wrote a wonderful book many years ago called The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat.<br />
This was a series of profiles of people who had surprising neurological disorders<br />
&#xa0;and the title case of the book was a man who actually had such an inability to recognize faces,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;he couldn't distinguishes his wife's face from that of a hat.<br />
Milder forms of Prosopagnosia, which some people suffer from<br />
&#xa0;and to be honest, I got a little bit of some terrible faces.<br />
Is that you could recognize faces as faces,<br />
&#xa0;but you can't recognize whose face they are and it's very hard for you to recognize people.<br />
<br />
There's problems of sensory neglect.<br />
You get disorders that block out one part of the world.<br />
You might have damage to parts of your brain that would block out the left side of the world.<br />
It's not just the sort of physical thing,<br />
&#xa0;when you ask somebody with such a disorder to draw clock for instance,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;they'll put all the numbers from one to 12 on the right side of the clock.<br />
It's as if they don't think of the left side of the world again.<br />
So, maybe it's not even a sensory problem, but an attentional problem.<br />
<br />
There's Aphasia, which refers to disorders of language.<br />
Some forms of aphasia are expressive like a Broca's Aphasia, where you can't really speak.<br />
A famous case of somebody who can only use the word tan,<br />
&#xa0;would say tan, tan, tan, but couldn't say anything else.<br />
Or then there's something that's called Receptive Aphasia,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;where you can speak although what you say doesn't make much sense,<br />
&#xa0;but also you have a terrible time understanding other people.<br />
<br />
Then there's all sorts of other disorders.<br />
There's the disorder which we talked about with regard to Phineas Gage and various forms of it.<br />
There's damage to your brain, it's debatable whether this is true Phineas Gage,<br />
&#xa0;but there are other cases where it's much more clear.<br />
Cause you to lose your moral sense, your sense of right and wrong,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;your ability to control yourself,<br />
&#xa0;to restrain yourself perhaps your conscience.<br />
<br />
Now, we're going to talk about all of these things through the course but the moral here is that,<br />
&#xa0;A, there's some localization of function.<br />
There's some sense in which it correspond to different brain areas.<br />
B, again, this is an argument against dualism.<br />
We can see that in that anyone who argued that the mind isn't the brain<br />
&#xa0;would be hard-pressed to explain why damage to the brain<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;seems to affect some very intimate and very important aspects of ourselves.<br />

2-1 4 大脑的部分<br />
那么，让我们来谈谈大脑的不同部分以及它们的功能。<br />
大脑的不同部分被功能化用于不同的目的，它们执行不同的任务。<br />
这就是为什么大脑的不同部分受到损伤会产生不同的影响。<br />
这也是当你观察fMRI扫描、PET扫描或记录神经活动的工具时，你可以通过活动的位置推测出发生了什么。<br />
首先要明白，我在谈论大脑，但如果我更加精确和包容，我应该说是大脑和脊髓的部分。<br />
并不是所有的活动都需要大脑。<br />
有些活动可以在没有大脑参与的情况下发生，比如新生儿的吸吮反射、手臂因疼痛而缩回或呕吐。<br />
但在这门课程中讨论的其他所有内容，都会涉及大脑。<br />
大脑中一些非常重要的结构被称为皮质下结构，意思是它们位于大脑皮层下方，也就是大脑中心区域。<br />
这包括延髓，它控制一些自动功能，比如心率、血压、吞咽等。<br />
还包括小脑，它参与身体平衡和肌肉协调。<br />
小脑包含大约300亿个神经元，这并不是小数目。<br />
还有下丘脑，它参与进食、性欲、口渴和其他各种欲望。<br />
当我们讨论情绪或本能欲望时，我们会再次回到这些脑区。<br />
然而，对人类心理学最独特的方面，我们主要关注的是大脑的外层——大脑皮层。<br />
大脑皮层是皱折非常多的。<br />
如果你把大脑取出并将皮层展开，就像从车后备箱里取出一块地毯并铺开，它大约有两平方英尺（约0.2平方米）。<br />
为了塞进大脑中，需要大量的皱折。<br />
大脑皮层大约有3毫米厚。<br />
这里才是真正的“舞台”，至少对于我感兴趣的东西，这里是发生一切的地方。<br />
推理、语言和复杂感知都来自这里。<br />
鱼类没有大脑皮层，爬行动物和鸟类有一点点，灵长类动物（包括人类）有大量的大脑皮层。<br />
当你观察大脑皮层时，你会发现它有两半——左半球和右半球。<br />
对于每一半大脑皮层，你可以将其划分为不同的脑叶。<br />
从前额向后延伸，依次是额叶、顶叶、枕叶和颞叶。<br />
这些脑叶各自负责不同的功能，我们稍后会详细讨论。<br />
大脑皮层中另一个非常有趣的特点是它包含地图。<br />
这意味着大脑中靠近的两个区域通常对应身体中彼此靠近的部位。<br />
在运动区中，如果刺激某个区域，相应的身体部位就会抽搐。<br />
例如，中指在拇指旁边，而拇指又靠近手肘。<br />
在现实世界中距离近的身体部位，在大脑中的表示也是相邻的。<br />
还有初级躯体感觉区，它与感官器官有关。<br />
如果你在手术中刺激这些区域，病人可能会体验到声音、闪光或触觉。<br />
事实上，枕叶中存在一个视觉地图，颞叶中存在一个听觉地图。<br />
更酷的是，这些地图是拓扑地图，但大脑区域的大小并不对应实际身体部位的大小，而是对应运动或感觉功能的程度。<br />
艺术家曾绘制过如果人体按大脑区域大小比例来画的图片，身体躯干相对较小，但手和脸巨大，因为这些部位有更多的感觉输入。<br />
大脑皮层的一部分是投射区，但投射区占不到皮层的四分之一。<br />
其余部分涉及更复杂的功能，比如语言、推理和道德思考。<br />
那么，我们如何知道这些信息呢？<br />
有几种答案。<br />
一种是通过脑部扫描。<br />
我们可以使用MRI（磁共振成像），通过高频磁场来观察大脑活动，了解人在执行不同任务时哪些部位活跃。<br />
另一种方法是通过所谓的自然实验，比如肿瘤、中风或摩托车事故造成的大脑损伤。<br />
通过观察大脑的损伤区域及其对应的功能缺失，我们可以推断出不同脑区的作用。<br />
通过这些方法，我们了解了大脑的不同部分及其功能。<br />
现在，我们来谈谈大脑损伤或中风可能导致的一些特定障碍。<br />
例如，**失用症（Apraxia）**是动作障碍。<br />
患者无法执行某些动作，比如挥手再见或用叉子吃饭。<br />
他们并不是瘫痪，而是无法协调这些基本动作形成复杂行为。<br />
**失认症（Agnosia）**是感知障碍。<br />
患者并非看不见，而是无法识别物体。<br />
有一种被称为心因性盲视的类型，患者可以描述图像的部分，但无法识别图像所代表的物体。<br />
特定类型的失认症叫做面孔失认症（Prosopagnosia），即患者无法识别面孔。<br />
奥利弗·萨克斯曾写过一本著名的书《误把妻子当帽子的人》，其中描述了一位患者因无法识别面孔，竟将妻子的脸与帽子混淆。<br />
轻度的面孔失认症让人能够识别面孔，但无法认出是谁，识别人变得非常困难。<br />
还有感觉忽视症（Sensory Neglect），患者会忽视世界的一侧。<br />
例如，如果右脑损伤，患者可能会忽视左侧世界。<br />
当你让这些患者画一个钟表时，他们会把1到12的数字全部画在钟表的右半边，仿佛左侧世界不存在一样。<br />
这可能不仅仅是感觉问题，更像是注意力问题。<br />
**失语症（Aphasia）**指的是语言障碍。<br />
**布洛卡失语症（Broca's Aphasia）**是一种表达性失语症，患者无法说话。<br />
有一位著名患者只能说“tan, tan, tan”，再也说不出其他词语。<br />
还有维尔尼克失语症（Wernicke's Aphasia），患者可以说话，但话语毫无意义，同时很难理解别人说的话。<br />
还有很多其他障碍。<br />
例如，关于**菲尼亚斯·盖奇（Phineas Gage）**的病例，涉及道德感的丧失、自我控制力的丧失，甚至良心的丧失。<br />
通过这些病例，我们得到两个结论：<br />
A，功能定位，即不同的大脑区域对应不同的功能。<br />
B，这也是反对二元论（Dualism）的论据。<br />
如果有人认为心灵与大脑无关，那么解释为什么大脑损伤会影响我们最亲密和重要的自我特征就会变得非常困难。<br />
