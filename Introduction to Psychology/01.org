Hi, I'm Paul Bloom, and I'm delighted to welcome you to Introduction to Psychology.
I've been here at Yale for about 20 years, and just about every year, I teach intro psych.
I teach it to hundreds of undergraduates.
It is one of my favorite courses to teach.
But I'm particularly thrilled to be able now to present the material of intro psych to a broader audience.
Now, there's all different ways you could take this course.
Nobody would blame you if you decide to just dive in, look at electron Freud, or about mistakes and memory, or about depression.
Electrodes can be listened to or watched out of order.
But what I would suggest if you can is treat it like a course.
Sit with your laptop in front of you with a cup of strong coffee and a cigar, take notes, go through it bit by bit in order in which it's given, take the exams.
Exams are not meant to be difficult, but they are meant to sort of tap your understanding of the material as you go through it.
Once you've done that, you could be said to have taken a course on intro psych.
Then, if you want to move it up one level, you can do the associated readings.
The readings are online.
They're from an excellent textbook.
They're free.
They're written clearly.
If you do lectures and you do the readings, then you can legitimately say you took intro to psych and you'll have a tremendous background.
The course covers every important aspect of the science of the mind.

I start off with the brain asking the question of how this physical lump of me gives rise to mental life.
We talk about Freud and Skinner looking at the historical foundations of psychology.
We talk about how children develop including some research I've done on that building over there.
We talk about how we learn to speak.
We move to perception how we see the world, how we remember the world, how we attend to the world.
We target the emotions, love, lust, anger, kindness, and hatred.
We explore how we interact socially, how prejudices form, what we like about one another.
We'll talk about differences, how we're different, why we're different, what this means for us, and we'll talk about clinical disorders like depression and anxiety.
What disorders many of you suffer from and what causes them and what can cure them, and we'll end with an overview about happiness.
What the scientific study of psychology tells us about how to be happy.
I'm admittedly biased, but I think psychology is most interesting topic around.
So, I'm delighted to have you take this course.
