<h2 id="orgb610b74">2-2 4 Defense mechanisms</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb610b74">
<p class="verse">
So, suppose you survive these developmental stages and you're now an adult,<br />
&#xa0;and you're not out of the woods yet,<br />
&#xa0;there are all sorts of challenges and problems you're faced with.<br />
One problem is that your Id is sending up all sorts of desires,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;all sorts of weird sick stuff, sexual and violent,<br />
&#xa0;and these are forbidden by the super ego.<br />
It's not merely that you can't act upon them, so you shouldn't be thinking them,<br />
&#xa0;and so they get pushed down or repressed.<br />
You could even imagine a sort of a metaphor of you pushing down something,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;like some water spraying out from leaks on a floor<br />
&#xa0;and you're jamming towels over it or something like that.<br />
Some of this repressed stuff, as in my fine metaphor, spills out, you can't contain everything.<br />
For Freud, it spills out in jokes and slips of the tongue and in dreams.<br />
<br />
But also for Freud, there are other ways to cope with these desires.<br />
There's other ways to repress them and these are what Freud described as defense mechanisms.<br />
They defend the ego from this terrible stuff that's coming out from the Id,<br />
&#xa0;and some of these you may be familiar with.<br />
We tend to use them in everyday language, another example of Freud's influence.<br />
There's displacement, where you redirect shameful thoughts to more appropriate targets.<br />
You can imagine a boy who hates his father,<br />
&#xa0;and that's really unacceptable, you shouldn't hate your father.<br />
So instead, he bullies another kid or kicks the dog.<br />
He turns his anger and his hatred towards his father<br />
&#xa0;to a more appropriate and more acceptable target.<br />
So, there's sublimation.<br />
Sublimation you take desires that are unacceptable<br />
&#xa0;and you displace them to more valuable activities.<br />
So for instance, somebody who has a strong sexual desires of forbiddens<br />
&#xa0;might devote a lot of energy to his or her work or studies.<br />
<br />
There's projection.<br />
Projection is reducing anxiety<br />
&#xa0;by taking these impulses you have that you're ashamed of and attributing them to somebody else.<br />
So, imagine a woman with strong homosexual desires, and because of how she was raised,<br />
&#xa0;her super ego tells her these are unacceptable, they're inappropriate.<br />
So she becomes unconscious of them.<br />
But she comes to believe that there are other women are sexually drawn to her.<br />
Or you may really dislike somebody you shouldn't dislike,<br />
&#xa0;and then come to a conclusion, "Oh my gosh, this person must hate me."<br />
Because your own shameful feelings are unacceptable, you will project them onto somebody else.<br />
<br />
There's rationalization, where you have certain anxiety-producing thoughts<br />
&#xa0;and you reason them away into more acceptable ways.<br />
So for instance, somebody might get pleasure,<br />
&#xa0;a father may get pleasure physically punishing his children.<br />
But nobody wants to think that of themselves.<br />
So the way he describes it to himself, the way he really believes it at the level of the self,<br />
&#xa0;the ego is that he's doing it for their own good.<br />
You know in general, a lot of the bad things we do, we rationalize.<br />
<br />
There's regression, and you see this in children<br />
&#xa0;where the idea is under certain forms of stress<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;or stressful desires and stressful impulses from the id,<br />
&#xa0;you might retreat to a mode of behavior that's characteristic of an earlier stage.<br />
So you see this in some sense a child might suddenly act like a much younger child.<br />
<br />
Finally, there's reaction formation which is cool and of unintuitive,<br />
&#xa0;where you replace threatening wishes and fantasies with their opposites.<br />
So you might express and finally say, "Oh, I love this person. This person is my favorite person."<br />
As a way to mask the fact that you really don't love them at all, in fact, you hate them.<br />
<br />
Now, these defense mechanisms proposed by Freud are just everyday life, we have them all the time.<br />
But sometimes, we fail to properly repress the impulses from the id,<br />
&#xa0;and then you get into some real problems.<br />
You get what Freud called hysteria.<br />
Hysteria according to Freud are these symptoms which showed up quite often in Freud's time<br />
&#xa0;and maybe show up now only they're manifested in different ways,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;such as blindness and deafness without any physical cause, paralysis, tremblings,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;panic attacks, gaps of memory including amnesia and so on.<br />
For Freud, these are nothing more than symptoms.<br />
They're ways in which we keep our impulses, our memories, our desires under lock and key.<br />
We keep forbidden stuff under lock and key.<br />
The simplest example, for instance, is you had this horrible event, something you did,<br />
&#xa0;something you saw and you just can't cope with it, so you forget it.<br />
You have a form of amnesia, where you black it out.<br />
Freud believed that when these memories are recovered or when the impulses come to light,<br />
&#xa0;there's what he called catharsis, an explosive release, an emotional release of insight.<br />
So, then when you're treating these hysterical symptoms,<br />
&#xa0;you'd want to get to them through ways that could facilitate this catharsis,<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;facilitate this understanding.<br />
<br />
Freud originally tried to get at this through hypnosis, but later on moved to free association,<br />
&#xa0;which is a tool that sometimes used.<br />
The idea of free association is you give somebody a word and he says something back,<br />
&#xa0;but because it's so speeded, they don't have time to censor it.<br />
Ideally, you get the true insight into what's working in their mind<br />
&#xa0;without the filtering powers that the ego and the super ego have.<br />
So, for instance, a fanciful example is, we're in a session and I say, "Dog," and you say, "Cat,"<br />
&#xa0;and I say, "Lunch," and you say, "Sandwich," and I say, "Mother," and you say, "Sex."<br />
Well, and then you're embarrassed.<br />
You offer resistance.<br />
You say, "Oh, I didn't mean to say that."<br />
You don't go to your next appointment.<br />
You get angry at the therapist.<br />
This is part of the dance of psychoanalysis.<br />
Freud used these methods and many others to explore inner conflicts,<br />
&#xa0;and what goes on in psychoanalysis and its success at reading people is a topic<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;that we're going to get to at the very end of this course.<br />
